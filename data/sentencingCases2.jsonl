Galway, for the Accused))HEARD:June 25, 2014K.L. Campbell J.:Reasons for SentenceA.Overview[1]On the night of May 25, 2012, the accused, Tom Le, was arrested in\npossession of a fully-loaded restricted firearm, namely, a .45 calibre\nsemi-automatic Ruger pistol, and 13 grams of crack cocaine.At the time, there\nwere valid court orders in effect prohibiting him from the possession of any\nfirearm.He was also on probation.[2]The accused was charged with ten criminal offences, namely: (1)\npossession of a firearm without holding a licence; (2) possession of a firearm\nknowing he was not the holder of a licence; (3) possession of a loaded restricted\nfirearm without having an authorization, licence, or registration certificate;\n(4) careless storage of ammunition; (5) carrying a firearm in a careless\nmanner; (6) two counts of breaching previous court orders prohibiting him from\npossessing a firearm; (7) possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking;\n(8) possession of cocaine; and (9) possession of the proceeds of crime\n(Canadian currency) not exceeding $5,000.The accused pled not guilty to all\nof these alleged offences.[3]The accused challenged the admissibility of the firearm and the drugs,\narguing that they had been obtained by the police in violation of his rights under\nss. 8 and 9 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and ought to\nbe excluded under s. 24(2) of the Charter.In reasons released on April\n1, 2014, I dismissed this application by the accused, and found that the\nevidence was admissible.See: R. v. Le, 2014 ONSC 2033 (CanLII), [2014] O.J. No.\n1515.The parties agreed that, if admissible, this evidence established the\nguilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt with respect to the firearms and\ndrug-related offences.[4]Subsequently, the Crown established that the accused, by his possession\nof the firearm, breached two previous court orders which expressly prohibited him\nfrom possessing a firearm.I am also satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that\nthe accused, who was arrested with $650 of drug money in his pocket, was in\npossession of the proceeds of crime under $5,000.Accordingly, the accused is\nguilty of all ten of the offences alleged in the indictment.[5]To date, the accused has served close to two years and two months (783\ndays to be precise) in pre-sentence custody.There is no issue between the\nparties that the accused should be given enhanced credit for this period of\npre-sentence detention, as permitted by s. 719(3.1) of the Criminal Code.I agree.This result is required by the application of the Supreme Court of\nCanada decision in R. v Summers, 2014 SCC 26 (CanLII), at paras. 7, 34, 68-80, affirming:\n2013 ONCA 147 (CanLII), 114 O.R. (3d) 641, in order to fairly compensate the accused for\nhis lost eligibility for early release and the relative harshness of the\nconditions of his pre-sentence detention.Giving the accused the maximum\nenhanced credit legally available means that the accused receives a total\ncredit for having already served the equivalent of three years, two months and\n20 days.I give him this credit.[6]The Crown contends that the accused should receive a global sentence of\nseven years imprisonment.More specifically, the Crown argues that, before the\naccused is given any credit for his pre-sentence custody, the accused should\nreceive a five year sentence of imprisonment for his firearms offence, a one\nyear term of imprisonment (consecutive) for his drug offence, and a further one\nyear term of imprisonment (consecutive) for breaching the previous court orders\nprohibiting him from possessing a firearm.This would result, once the accused\nis given the agreed credit for his pre-sentence custody, in a sentence of three\nyears, nine months and ten days.[7]Defence counsel contends that the accused should receive a global\nsentence of between three and four-and-a-half years imprisonment.More\nspecifically, defence counsel argues that, before the accused is given any\ncredit for his pre-sentence custody, he should receive a sentence of between\ntwo and three years imprisonment for the firearms offence, a sentence of\nbetween six and twelve months imprisonment (consecutive) for breaching the\nprevious court orders prohibiting him from possessing a firearm, and a sentence\nof six months imprisonment (consecutive) for the drug offence.This would\nresult, once the accused is given the agreed credit for his pre-sentence\ncustody, in a sentence of no more than one year, three months and 10 days, even\nif the accused received a sentence at the very upper end of that proposed range.Defence counsel accurately observed that, if the accused was now sentenced to a\nterm of imprisonment of two years or less, a term of probation could also be\nimposed upon the accused, which would extend the period of supervisory control\nover the accused for potentially an additional three years.B.The Facts of the Firearm\nand Drug Offences[8]On the evening of May 25, 2012, the three Toronto Police Service (TPS)\nofficers were directed by security guards working in the Atkinson Housing\nCo-operative to a particular townhouse backyard.When the officers attended at\nthat location, they found five young males talking in the backyard area.The\nofficers entered the backyard through the open gateway.[9]While the police were talking to some of the young men, the accused\nbegan acting nervously and started “blading” his body in order to conceal from\nthe police the bag on his hip area – the bag that contained the fully-loaded\nsemi-automatic firearm.Shortly thereafter, when the accused was asked about\nthe contents of the bag, he fled.[10]The\npolice gave chase and eventually tackled the accused to the ground.After a\nshort but frantic struggle, during which the accused reached for his bag, the\naccused was subdued and arrested.The gun had nine rounds in the magazine and\none in the chamber and, as the firearm had no “safety” mechanism, it was ready\nto fire.The accused needed only to pull the gun out of the bag and pull the\ntrigger.[11]Later,\nat the police station, when he was being further searched, the accused pulled a\nbag containing 13 grams of crack cocaine out of the crotch area of his pants,\nand provided it to the police.The accused was also found in possession of two\ncell phones, which he admitted he used in his drug trafficking exploits.[12]In\nhis trial testimony, the accused admitted that he had purchased the firearm a\ncouple of months earlier, for his own protection, for approximately $2,000.The accused also admitted that he had purchased the 13 grams of crack cocaine for\napproximately $700, and it was not for his personal use, but rather was for\npurposes of sale to others.The accused also admitted that the $650 in cash in\nhis pocket was from a drug sale he had made the previous day.C.The Personal\nCircumstances of the Accused[13]The\naccused is now close to 23 years old.At the time of the offences he was just\n20 years of age.Despite his young age, the accused has already amassed a\nsignificant history of criminal conduct.As a youth, he was found guilty of three\ncounts of assault with a weapon, failing to comply with conditions of an\nundertaking, robbery, being disguised with intent, trafficking in cocaine, and\npossession of the proceeds of crime.His longest custodial sentence as a youth\nwas four months in custody.As an adult, the accused has only been found\nguilty of one prior criminal offence, an assault, for which he was given a\nconditional discharge and a 12 month period of probation in March of 2012.[14]The\naccused has five siblings, some older and some younger.His brothers and\nsisters appear to remain largely supportive.At the time of the offences, the\naccused was living at home with his disabled mother, in a subsidized housing\nunit in Toronto.His father is deceased.His mother has indicated that, when\nhe is ultimately released from custody, he is welcome to return to her\nresidence and continue living with her.[15]The\naccused has a grade 12 education, and completed his secondary school education\nwith good grades.While he wanted, at one point, to go to law school, he did\nnot immediately take any productive steps toward such an education.In the fall\nof 2010 the accused was registered to attend a paralegal program in a Toronto college.However, just as he was commencing this program, he was arrested in relation to\nhis one adult offence, and the conditions of his release (i.e. house\narrest) prevented him from continuing with this educational program, or seeking\nemployment.The accused has since accepted that he will not be able,\nrealistically, to continue in this program, and will not be able to become a\nparalegal.The only “job” in which the accused has been engaged, during the\nshort period between the completion of his high school studies and the onset of\nhis paralegal program, was drug trafficking.The accused has indicated,\nhowever, that eventually he wants to study a trade and secure employment in the\nconstruction industry.D.The\nRule Against Multiple Convictions[16]The\naccused contends that, pursuant to the rule in R. v. Kienapple, 1974 CanLII 14 (SCC), [1975] 1\nS.C.R. 729, at pp. 744-754, he cannot be convicted of all of the crimes of\nwhich he has been found guilty.This rule prevents an accused from being\nconvicted of multiple offences arising from the same transaction where the\nelements of the offences are substantially the same.This rule prevents\nmultiple convictions where there is both a factual and legal nexus amongst the\noffences.In such circumstances, the accused should only be convicted of the\nmost serious of the offences, and the findings of guilt in relation to the\nother similar offences should be conditionally stayed.See also: R. v.\nPrince, 1986 CanLII 40 (SCC), [1986] 2 S.C.R. 480, at pp. 491-503; R. v. Provo, 1989 CanLII 71 (SCC), [1989] 2\nS.C.R. 3, at pp. 12-18; R. v. K.(R.) (2005), 2005 CanLII 21092 (ON CA), 198 C.C.C. (3d) 232\n(Ont.C.A.), at paras. 27-56; R. v. Crevier, 2013 ONSC 2630 (CanLII), [2013] O.J.\nNo. 2257, at paras. 37-46; Mr. Justice E.G. Ewaschuk, Criminal Pleadings\n\u0026 Practice in Canada (Loose-Leaf, 2nd ed.), vol. 2, at § 16:6000.[17]I\nagree that the Kienapple principle applies in the circumstances of the\npresent case.More particularly, in my view, the application of this rule\nprevents the accused from being convicted of the offence of possession of a\nfirearm without being the holder of a licence under which he may lawfully\npossess it, contrary to s. 91(1)(a) of the Criminal Code.The very\nsimilar offence created by s. 95(1) of the Code arose from the same\nfactual transaction, and is clearly the more serious offence, as indicated by\nits greater maximum sentence.The accused will, accordingly, be convicted of\nthe s. 95(1) offence, but the finding of guilt in relation to the s. 91(1)(a)\noffence will be conditionally stayed.See: R. v. Naples, 2009 BCCA 141 (CanLII),\n268 B.C.A.C. 233, at paras. 2-4; R. v. Vidal, 2009 BCSC 1095 (CanLII), [2009]\nB.C.J. No. 1602, at paras. 1, 10; R. v. Duhamel, 2013 ONSC 1340 (CanLII), 1 C.R.\n(7th) 200, at paras. 12, 52.[18]While\ndefence counsel argued that the same result should obtain with respect to the\nfinding of guilt for the offence of possession of a firearm knowing that he was\nnot the holder of a licence under which he may lawfully possess it, contrary to\ns. 92(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, the authorities emanating from this\ncourt that have analyzed the issue have held to the contrary.See: R. v.\nStephens, [2009] O.J. No. 6102 (S.C.J.), at paras. 21-24; R. v. Brown,\n2013 ONSC 4230 (CanLII), [2013] O.J. No. 3095, at paras. 39-44; R. v. Saikaley,\n2013 ONSC 2699 (CanLII), [2013] O.J. No. 2331, at paras. 14-34; R. v. Hamilton,\n2013 ONSC 3127 (CanLII), [2013] O.J. No. 2715, at paras. 1, 3; R. v. Williams,\n[2007] O.J. No. 1354, at paras. 2-3; R. v. Harutyunyan, 2012 ONSC 58 (CanLII), affirmed:\n2012 ONCA 637 (CanLII), at paras. 4-8; R. v. Crevier, at paras. 37-46.These\nauthorities collectively suggest that there are significant and sufficient\nlegal differences between the offences created by ss. 95(1) and 92(1) such that\nan accused may properly be convicted of both without violating the rule in Kienapple.Some of these authorities note that the main legal difference between these\noffences is that the s. 92(1) offence requires proof of a specific intent,\nnamely, that the accused had possession of the firearm “knowing” that he or she\nwas not the holder of the requisite licence and registration certificate,\nwhereas the s. 95(1) offence does not require proof of this specific intent.Accordingly, the accused will also be convicted of the offence contrary to s.\n92(1) of the Criminal Code.[19]The\nCrown has conceded that the accused cannot properly be convicted of both the\noffences of careless storage of ammunition and carelessly carrying a firearm,\ngiven that the only evidence that the accused carelessly stored ammunition was\nthe evidence that the accused was carelessly carrying a loaded firearm.Accordingly, the accused will be convicted of the more serious offence of\ncarelessly carrying a firearm, and the finding of guilt in relation to the\noffence of careless storage of ammunition will be conditionally stayed.[20]The\nCrown has also conceded that the accused cannot properly be convicted of both\nthe offences of possession of cocaine for the purposes of trafficking and\nsimple possession of cocaine.Accordingly, the accused will be convicted of\nthe more serious offence of possession of cocaine for the purposes of\ntrafficking, and the finding of guilt in relation to the lesser offence of\nsimple possession of cocaine will be conditionally stayed.[21]The\naccused will be convicted of the three remaining offences of which he has been\nfound guilty, namely, possession of proceeds of crime and two counts of\nbreaching firearms prohibition orders.These other offences are all\nsufficiently different, in terms of their respective legal components, that the\nrule against multiple convictions for the same delict has no further application.E.The\nGoverning Sentencing Principles[22]Pursuant\nto s. 718 of the Criminal Code, the “fundamental purpose” of sentencing\nis to contribute to “respect for the law and the maintenance of a just,\npeaceful and safe society” by imposing “just sanctions” that have one or more\nof the following objectives: (1) to denounce unlawful conduct; (2) to deter the\noffender and others from committing offences; (3) to separate offenders from\nsociety where necessary; (4) to assist in rehabilitating offenders; (5) to\nprovide reparations for harm done to victims or the community; and (6) to\npromote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgment of the harm\ndone to victims and the community.[23]Further,\naccording to s. 718.1 of the Code, the “fundamental principle” of\nsentencing is that a sentence “must be proportionate to the gravity of the\noffence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.”[24]As\nrequired by s. 718.2 of the Code, in imposing sentence, the court must\nalso take into account a number of principles including the following: (1) a\nsentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating\nor mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender; (2) a\nsentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for\nsimilar offences committed in similar circumstances; (3) where consecutive\nsentences are imposed, the combined sentence should not be unduly long or\nharsh; (4) an offender should not be deprived of liberty, if less restrictive\nsanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances; and (5) all available\nsanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances\nshould be considered for all offenders, with particular attention to the circumstances\nof aboriginal offenders.F.The\nAggravating and Mitigating Circumstances of this Case[25]As\noutlined by Crown counsel in her submissions, the aggravating circumstances of\nthis case include all of the following:•While the accused is still a young man, he has a lengthy youth\nrecord for serious offences, and has already been found guilty of one criminal\noffence as an adult.•The semi-automatic firearm in the possession of the accused was\nfully loaded and ready to fire, in that the magazine contained nine rounds of\nammunition, there was one round in the chamber and the firearm had no “safety”\nmechanism.•The accused was clearly using the loaded firearm to protect\nhimself in connection with his drug trafficking enterprise.•In his trial testimony, the accused candidly admitted that he was\nengaged in trafficking in cocaine.Indeed, the accused admitted that the\ncocaine in his possession on the night of the offences was for purposes of\nsale, and the significant amount of cash in his pocket was the proceeds of an earlier\ndrug transaction.•The flight by the accused and his struggle with the police caused\na great risk to public safety, in that if the gun had been fired, either\nintentionally or accidentally, one of the police officers, a member of the\npublic, or the accused himself might easily have been wounded or killed.•These offences took place in an area of Toronto plagued by an\ninordinately high incidence of violent and dangerous crime, and the\nvulnerability of the members of the community who live in this area of the city\nwas well known to the accused.[26]As\noutlined by defence counsel in her submissions, the mitigating circumstances of\nthis case include all of the following considerations:•The accused is still a very young man and, given his personal\ncircumstances, the accused has reasonable prospects for rehabilitation.•While the accused has a youth record, and has been found guilty\nas an adult with respect to one earlier matter, these offences are his first\nadult convictions.•In terms of the previous sentencing dispositions that have been\nimposed upon the accused, either as an adult or a youth, the most serious\ndisposition required him to serve but a few months in custody.•There is no evidence that the accused ever shot the firearm, or used\nit as a weapon or threat against any person.•The firearm found in the possession of the accused has not been\ntraced back to the commission of any earlier criminal offences.•The accused took steps to expedite his trial, and did not contest\nsome aspects of the case against him.G.The Global Sentence\nMerited by the Offences and the Offender[27]I have reached the conclusion that, for the following reasons, the\nappropriate global sentence, in all of the circumstances of the present case,\nis a sentence of five years imprisonment.More particularly, in my view, the\naccused should receive an effective sentence of three years imprisonment for\nthe firearms offences, an additional one year term of imprisonment for the drug\noffence and the proceeds of crime offence, and an additional one year term of\nimprisonment for breaching the two weapons prohibition orders.That is the\neffective sentence that will be imposed upon the accused today, less the\nenhanced credit for his time in pre-sentence custody.[28]Accordingly, after appropriately crediting the accused with having\nalready served the equivalent of three years, two months and 20 days, the\naccused shall now be sentenced to a total reformatory term of incarceration of one\nyear, nine months, and 10 days.In an effort to sensibly break down this total\nfigure into smaller terms of imprisonment, and making some of the sentences appropriately\nconsecutive, I sentence the accused as follows:•For the firearms offences outlined in counts two, three and five\nof the indictment, the accused is sentenced to a term of seven months and ten\ndays imprisonment on each count (concurrent);•For the two breach of court order offences described in counts six\nand seven of the indictment, the accused is sentenced to a further seven month\nterm of imprisonment (concurrent – but consecutive to the sentence for the\nfirearms offences); and,•For the drug offence in count eight of the indictment and the\nproceeds of crime offence in count 10 of the indictment, the accused is\nsentenced to an additional seven month term of imprisonment (concurrent – but\nconsecutive to the sentences for the firearms offences and the breach of court\norder offences).[29]Totaling these three groups of consecutive sentences, results in the\nimposition of a total sentence of one year, nine months and ten days\nimprisonment.I will also impose a three year term of probation and the\nancillary sentencing orders to which the parties have essentially agreed.H.The Firearms\nOffences[30]The\ncircumstances of the present case have led me to conclude that the firearms\noffences call for the imposition of a three year penitentiary term of imprisonment.I appreciate that there is no longer any three year mandatory minimum sentence\nof imprisonment for the offence of unlawfully possessing a loaded prohibited\nfirearm while not the holder of an authorization or licence and registration\ncertificate, pursuant to s. 95(2)(a)(i) of the Criminal Code.I impose\nthis sentence on the accused only because I consider it is fair and appropriate\nin all of the circumstances.See: R. v. Nur, 2013 ONCA 677 (CanLII), 117 O.R.\n(3d) 401, at paras. 4, 6, 51-52, 107-109, 144, 206.[31]The\naccused was walking the streets of Toronto with a fully loaded semi-automatic\nhandgun that was ready to fire.The magazine was full of ammunition, there was\na bullet already in the firing chamber, and there was no functioning safety\nmechanism anywhere on the firearm.All that was required to discharge the\nfirearm was for the accused to pull the trigger.In R. v. Ferrigon,\n2007 CanLII 16828 (ON SC), [2007] O.J. No. 1883 (S.C.J.), at para. 25, Malloy J. made these observations\nabout the grave danger inherent in just such a situation:Guns are dangerous.Handguns are particularly\ndangerous.Loaded, concealed handguns are even more dangerous.A person who\nloads a handgun with bullets and then carries that handgun, concealed on his\nperson, into a public place is by definition a dangerous person.Handguns are\nused to shoot people.A person who carries a loaded handgun in public has\ndemonstrated his willingness to shoot another human being with it.Otherwise\nthere would be no need to have loaded it.That person is dangerous.He is\ndangerous to those with whom he associates; he is dangerous to the police and\nother law enforcement personnel; he is dangerous to the members of his\ncommunity; he is dangerous to innocent bystanders, including children, who may\nbe killed or maimed by stray bullets.And equally importantly, he is dangerous\nto a way of life that is treasured in Canada and to which all residents of\nToronto are equally entitled – a way of life that respects the rule of law to\nensure the peace and safety of those who live here.[32]The\nattempted escape by the accused and his strenuous struggle with the police served\nonly to increase this great risk to public safety.Had the gun been fired,\neither intentionally or accidentally, one of the investigating police officers,\nan innocent member of the public nearby, or the accused himself, might easily\nhave been wounded or killed.[33]The\ncriminal possession of handguns in these circumstances remains an all too\nprevalent threat to the people of Toronto, and to others in the Greater Toronto\nArea.These firearms are almost invariably tools employed in some other\ncriminal activity, and their possession and use, on occasion, tragically\nresults in serious bodily harm or death.In the present case, the accused used\nhis firearm as protection in furtherance of his illicit drug trafficking.In\nso doing, the accused could easily have caused grievous bodily harm or death to\nothers.Accordingly, the criminal possession of such illegal firearms must be\nmet with custodial sentences that proportionally reflect the gravity of the\noffence, and which appropriately stress the need to denounce and deter such\ncrimes.The public simply must be adequately protected.See: R. v. Danvers\n(2005), 2005 CanLII 30044 (ON CA), 199 C.C.C. (3d) 490 (Ont.C.A.), at para. 78; R. v. Brown, 2010\nONCA 745 (CanLII), 277 O.A.C. 223, at para. 14; R. v. Morris, 2011 ONSC 5206 (CanLII),\n[2011] O.J. No. 3995, at paras. 10, 58, affirmed: 2013 ONCA 223 (CanLII), 305\nO.A.C. 47, at para. 17; R. v. Chambers, 2012 ONSC 817 (CanLII), [2012] O.J.

Smickle, 2014 ONCA 49 (CanLII),\n306 C.C.C. (3d) 351, at para. 19, “[m]ost s. 95 offences will attract a\npenitentiary term even for first offenders,” and even “less serious” versions\nof the crime than are typically committed “will demand the imposition of\nsentences at or very near the maximum reformatory sentence, even for first\noffenders.”See also: R. v. Nur, at paras. 107-109, 206, affirming\non this point: 2011 ONSC 4874 (CanLII), 275 C.C.C. (3d) 330, at paras. 41-45, 49-52,\n70, 145-149; R. v. Velez-Lau, 2011 ONSC 4805 (CanLII), [2011] O.J.

No. 1749, at\nparas. 21-28.I.The Drug Trafficking\nOffence[35]In\nall of the circumstances of this case, the accused should receive an additional\none year term of imprisonment for the drug trafficking offence and the proceeds\nof crime offence.In R. v. Peterkin, I concluded that a 22-year-old\naccused, with no prior criminal record, who had been found in possession of a fully\nloaded semi-automatic firearm and commercial quantities of marihuana and crack cocaine,\nshould receive a sentence of three years for the firearm offence and a one year\nconsecutive term of imprisonment for the drug offence.In arriving at that\nconclusion, I made the following observations, at para. 23, which I consider to\nbe equally applicable in the present case:This firearms offence was not, however, the only\noffence committed by the accused.He was also found in possession of\ncommercial quantities of cocaine and marihuana and the other typical trappings\nof the drug trafficking trade.In my view, this changes the complexion of the\ncase and renders the criminal conduct of the accused significantly more\nserious.Indeed, whether the accused’s drug offence, namely, the unlawful\npossession of a controlled substance (cocaine) for the purpose of trafficking,\nis treated as an aggravating circumstance of the firearms offence, or requires\nthe imposition of a separate consecutive sentence, in my view, this offence\nmust increase the effective custodial sentence on the accused by at least a\nyear.The combination of illegal loaded firearms and the sale of illicit drugs\nis a very dangerous and toxic mix that requires the imposition of serious penitentiary\nterms of imprisonment.See: R. v. Grant, 2006 CanLII 18347 (ON CA), [2006] O.J. No. 2179 (C.A.),\nat para. 82; varied: 2009 SCC 32 (CanLII), [2009] 2 S.C.R. 353; R. v. Brown,\n[2007] O.J. No. 5338 (S.C.J.), at paras. 34-38; R. v.

Johnson, 2013 ONSC 4217 (CanLII), [2013]\nO.J. No. 2957, at paras. 12, 26-28, 31-34.J.Breach of the\nWeapons Prohibition Order[37]At\nthe time of his firearm offences, the accused was subject to two court orders\nwhich strictly prohibited him from the possession of such a weapon.In R.\nv. Ellis, 2013 ONSC 3092 (CanLII), [2013] O.J. No. 2409, at para. 30, I commented\nthat the weight of authority strongly suggests that, as a general rule, in such\ncircumstances a consecutive sentence ought to be imposed for the breach of the\nweapons prohibition order.I also expressed my own agreement with that\nprincipled perspective, and suggested that, in the absence of a consecutive\nsentence, the accused would effectively receive no greater punishment as a\nresult of his or her clear violation of a previous court order.Accordingly, the\nintentional violation of an unequivocal court order requires some effective\nadditional sanction as offenders must understand that court orders governing\ntheir conduct must be followed or there will be real consequences for their\nviolation.See also: R. v. Manning, at paras. 42-43; R. v. Ferrigon,\nat paras. 60-65; R. v. W.C.A., [2010] O.J. No. 2677 (C.J.), at paras.\n49-51, affirmed: 2013 ONCA 385 (CanLII), 116 O.R. (3d) 500; R. v. Brown,\n2010 ONCA 745 (CanLII), 277 O.A.C. 233, at para. 15; R. v. Sadat and Mensah, 2011\nONSC 3303 (CanLII), at paras. 41-48; R. v. Jones, 2011 ONSC 5330 (CanLII), [2011] O.J.

Husaini, at paras. 49-51.[38]Applying\nthat principled approach in all of the circumstances of this case, and paying\nparticular attention to the totality of the sentence ultimately imposed, in my\nview, the accused ought to be sentenced to an additional one year term of\nimprisonment for his breach of these two earlier weapons prohibition orders.These\nsentences should be concurrent to each other but, as I have indicated,\nconsecutive to both the firearms offences and the drug offence.See: R. v.\nMohamed, 2014 ONCA 103 (CanLII), [2014] O.J. No. 574, at para. 4.K.The Global Sentence\nEffectively Imposed[39]In the result, the accused receives an effective global sentence of five\nyears imprisonment.More particularly, he receives an effective sentence of\nthree years imprisonment for the firearms offences, an additional one year term\nof imprisonment for the drug trafficking offence and the proceeds of crime\noffence, and a further additional one year term of imprisonment for the breach\nof the two weapons prohibition orders.However, having regard to the fact that\nthe accused must be credited with having already served the equivalent of three\nyears, two months and 20 days, I now sentence him to a total reformatory term\nof incarceration of one year, nine months and 10 days, distributed amongst the\noffences as I have indicated.The imposition of this sentence, after\nconsidering the pre-sentence custody already served by the accused, will\neffectively achieve the global five year term of imprisonment that I seek to\nimpose.[40]Viewed\nin its totality, this is a significant sentence of imprisonment, especially\ngiven the age of the accused.However, in my opinion, in light of the gravity\nof the crimes committed by the accused, and the clear need to denounce and\ndeter these kinds of dangerous offences, this is a fit, fair and proportionate sentence\nin all of the circumstances.While the young accused certainly remains someone\nwith clear rehabilitative potential, at this point, he is not headed to the\npenitentiary, but rather is obliged to serve a lengthy provincial reformatory\nterm of incarceration.A sentence of that duration should ensure that the\naccused remains optimistic about his future, and focused on the positive changes\nhe can make to his life upon his release from custody.He is an intelligent\nyoung man and he can become a valuable and contributing member of society.Moreover, given the length of this sentence of imprisonment, it can be\nproductively combined with a lengthy period of probation which will, hopefully,\nprovide the necessary measure of continued support and guidance to the accused\nonce he has served the custodial portion of his sentence.[41]This\nsentence is significantly less than the sentence sought by the Crown.However,\nin my view the Crowns argument failed to give due and effective consideration\nto the youthful age of the accused, and his positive prospects for rehabilitation.In my opinion, now sending the accused to the penitentiary for close to another\nfour years of imprisonment would likely prove to be counter-productive in terms\nof his ultimate rehabilitation and the ultimate, long-term interests of public\nsafety.[42]This\nsentence is somewhat greater than the upper end of the range of sentence suggested\nby defence counsel.In my view, however, her argument failed to fully acknowledge\nthe sheer gravity of the cluster of related offences committed by the accused, and\nthe need to denounce and deter others from engaging in conduct which involves\nthe combination of guns and drugs.The message must be sent that such\ninherently dangerous criminal activity will not be lightly tolerated by the\ncourts, and that weapons prohibition orders must be strictly obeyed, or there\nwill be significant practical consequences.L.The Accompanying\nProbation Order[43]As\nI have indicated, the imposition of a reformatory sentence of this duration,\npermits the imposition of a probation order.In my opinion, it is clearly in\nthe best rehabilitative interests of the accused that, following his release\nfrom the custodial portion of his sentence, he should be subject to the terms\nof a probation order for a period of three years.This probation order will\ninclude the statutory terms outlined in s. 732.1(2) of the Criminal Code,\ntogether with the following additional terms:•The accused shall report to a probation officer within two\nworking days of his release from custody, and thereafter as directed by the\nprobation officer;•The accused shall abstain absolutely from the possession or\nconsumption of any non-medically prescribed drugs.•The accused shall abstain from owning, possessing or carrying any\nweapon;•The accused shall perform 180 hours of community service, as\ndirected by the probation officer.•The accused shall seek and maintain gainful full-time employment,\nor attend an educational facility on a full-time basis;•The accused shall be amenable to any counseling programs that may\nbe recommended by his probation officer.M.Ancillary\nSentencing Orders[44]In\naddition, in my view the following six ancillary sentencing orders are\nappropriate in the circumstances of this case.[45]First,\npursuant to s. 491(1) of the Criminal Code, I order that the firearm and\nammunition that has been seized and detained in this case be forfeited to Her\nMajesty in right of Ontario and thereafter disposed of as directed by the\nAttorney General.[46]Second,\npursuant to s. 16(1)(a) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, I\norder that the drugs seized and detained in this case be forfeited to Her\nMajesty in right of Canada and thereafter disposed of as directed by the\nMinister of Health.[47]Third,\npursuant to s. 462.37 of the Criminal Code, I order that the proceeds of\ncrime, namely, the $650 in drug money collected from the accused, be forfeited\nto her Majesty in right of Canada to be disposed of as directed by the Attorney\nGeneral or otherwise dealt with according to the law.[48]Fourth,\npursuant to ss. 109(1)(b) and 109(3) of the Criminal Code, I order that\nthe accused be prohibited from the possession of any firearm, cross-bow,\nrestricted weapon, ammunition, and explosive substance for life.[49]Fifth,\nas the accused has been found guilty of committing a “secondary designated\noffence,” pursuant to s. 487.051(3) of the Criminal Code, I make an\norder in Form 5.04, to have samples of bodily substances taken from the accused\nfor purposes of forensic DNA analysis.[50]Sixth,\nI order that the accused pay a victim surcharge in the amount of $100 pursuant\nto s. 737(2)(b)(ii) of the Criminal Code.This was the amount of the\nsurcharge at the time the accused committed these offences.N.Conclusion[51]In\nthe result, after appropriately crediting the accused with having already\nserved the equivalent of three years, two months and 20 days, I now sentence\nthe accused to a total reformatory term of incarceration of one year, nine months\nand 10 days.That amounts to the effective global sentence of five years\nimprisonment that I have sought to impose.The accused is also subject to the\nthree-year term of probation and the various ancillary sentencing orders that I\nhave issued.I will endorse the indictment and the warrant of committal\naccordingly.___________________________Kenneth L.

Mullins, 2016 ONCA 415DATE: 20160527DOCKET: C60200Watt, Tulloch and Huscroft JJ.A.BETWEENHer Majesty the QueenRespondentandMichael MullinsAppellantMichael Mullins, acting in personErica Chozik, duty counselKaren Papadopoulos, for the respondentHeard and released orally: May\n11, 2016On appeal from the convictions entered\non November 28, 2014 and the sentence imposed on March 24, 2015 by Justice Anne\nM. Molloy of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting without a\njury.ENDORSEMENT[1]The appellant was convicted after a judge alone\ntrial in the Superior Court of Justice of counts of sexual assault and\nadministering a stupefying drug for the purpose of committing that assault. The\ncomplainant, a sometime close friend of the appellant’s daughter, was eighteen.\nThe appellant was forty-seven.[2]The trial judge imposed a sentence of 9 years on\nthe conviction of sexual assault. She deducted 9 months from that sentence to\nreflect time spent in pre-trial custody, time spent on judicial interim release\nthat included house arrest, and time served between conviction and sentence.[3]The appellant appeals both conviction and\nsentence.[4]On the appeal against conviction, the appellant\nadvances on his own behalf several grounds of appeal. He submits that the trial\njudge made anumber of errors in reaching her conclusion that Crown counsel\nhad proven his guilt of both offences beyond a reasonable doubt. Those errors,\nhe submitted, included, but are not limited to:i.a failure to properly apply the burden and standard of proof to the\nbody of circumstantial evidence which comprised the entirety of the case for\nthe Crown;ii.a failure to properly assess the inconsistencies in the complainant’s\ntestimony, and thus reaching conclusions about the credibility of the complainant\nand the reliability of her evidence that were unwarranted in the circumstances\nof this case;iii. an unwarranted acceptance of evidence about alteration of a date in\na photograph offered in defence; andiv. an unjustified rejection of the evidence of the appellant’s daughter\non the basis that she and the appellant had colluded on their testimony.[5]The appellant also contends that the trial judge\nerred in failing to enter a stay of proceedings on two unrelated grounds:i.loss of an audio and videorecorded statement of the complainant; andii.failure to conduct the appellant’s trial within a reasonable time.[6]Leaving to one side for the moment the grounds\nthat allege error in the failure to stay proceedings, the initial category of\nerrors contests factual findings that were available to the trial judge on the\nevidence adduced at trial. It is not, indeed cannot, reasonably be suggested\nthat these findings were not open to the trial judge. None are the product of\nlegal error or any misapprehension of evidence. The conclusion of the trial\njudge was one that a reasonable jury, properly instructed, could reasonably\nhave rendered. We are not entitled to re-try this or any case. And as it seems\nto us, this is precisely what we are being invited to do.[7]The claims of constitutional infringement\nsufficient to warrant a stay of proceedings fall on barren ground. Among other\nthings, an endorsement on the indictment reveals that the appellant abandoned\nany reliance on s. 11(b) at trial. The lost evidence complaint moves no\nfreight. It does not appear that this complaint was advanced at trial. Even if\nit had been pursued there, it is not a claim that could sustain a finding of\nconstitutional infringement, much less one that would warrant a stay of\nproceedings.[8]On the appeal from sentence, we are satisfied that\nthe sentence imposed falls within the range of sentence appropriate for these\noffences and the offender who committed them. Aggravating features\npredominated. Mitigating features were minimal. Even if we were to assume that\nthe trial judge was wrong to characterize the offence as reflecting a breach of\ntrust, we are not persuaded that if such a portrayal reflects error, that the\nerror had any meaningful impact on the result. It did not take the sentence\noutside the appropriate range or mislocate it within the appropriate range.[9]In a similar way, we are not persuaded that had\nthe Gladue material been before the sentencing judge, the result would\nhave been any different. The sentencing judge did give consideration to the\nappellant’s troubled childhood in determining the sentence she would impose.[10]What does appear to us, however, is that the\nsentencing judge gave inadequate effect to the time spent in custody and on\nrelease in reaching her conclusion about the net sentence she would impose. In\nour view, the appropriate credit should be 373 days. That would leave, as a remanet,\na sentence of 9 years less 373 days, or, by our reckoning, a net sentence of 8\nyears less 8 days, or put another way, 7 years, 357 days.[11]The appeal from conviction is dismissed. Leave\nto appeal sentence is granted and the appeal allowed to the extent that the\nsentence is reduced to one of 8 years, less 8 days, or 7 years plus 357 days.“David Watt\nJ.A.”“M.

Stone on June 20, 2002.CRONK J.A.:[1][1]The appellant was convicted of two counts of robbery\nand sentenced to eighteen months incarceration and three years probation.A\nten year weapons and firearm prohibition was also imposed.He seeks leave to\nappeal against his sentence and, if leave be granted, appeals against his\nsentence to this court.(1)Background[2][2]On June 25, 2000, at approximately 3:10 a.m., the\nappellant and two accomplices robbed a pizza store.The appellant drove the\ngetaway car.His two accomplices wore masks and carried metal pipes.They\nstole approximately $1,500 from the cash register and the sum of $40 from the\nwallet of the clerk who was on duty in the store.The clerk was not physically\nharmed.[3][3]The second robbery occurred at approximately 10:30 p.m.\non June 29, 2000 at a gas bar where two clerks were working.The appellant’s\naccomplices entered the gas bar, wearing masks.A scuffle ensued and one of\nthe gas bar attendants was cut across his right temple and ear with a knife\ncarried by one of the accomplices.The cut required six stitches to close.Both attendants were threatened and verbally abused.Approximately $160 was\nstolen from the cash register, together with cigarettes and cigars, $10 from\none of the attendants and the cell phone and money pouch of the other\nattendant.The appellant again drove the getaway car.He also communicated by\ncell phone with his two accomplices, providing advice on the best time to rob\nthe gas bar.[4][4]The appellant was nineteen years old at the time of the\nrobberies and had no prior criminal record.[5][5]Following an extended period of pre-trials, the\nappellant pleaded guilty to both robbery charges.[6][6]At trial, the parties agreed that a reformatory\nsentence was appropriate, but disagreed as to whether a conditional sentence\nshould be imposed.The appellant’s two accomplices received sentences of two\nyears less one day after credit for pre-trial custody, and twelve months secure\ncustody and two years probation, respectively, on two counts of robbery arising\nfrom the same incidents.(2)Issues[7][7]The appellant argues that his sentence is manifestly\nharsh and excessive given his personal circumstances and those of the case.In\nparticular, he asserts that his pleas of guilty, his ultimate co-operation with\nthe police, his relative youth and lack of a criminal record, his excellent\nrehabilitation prospects and the nature and extent of his role in the robberies\nwarranted imposition of a conditional sentence or a sentence in the low to\nmid-reformatory range.He further submits that the trial judge failed to apply\nproper sentencing principles by over-emphasizing the aggravating factors here,\nand by giving inadequate consideration to the sentences imposed on the\nappellant’s accomplices.(3)Analysis[8][8]The trial judge delivered lengthy and considered\nreasons for the sentence imposed in this case.He referred to the many evident\nmitigating factors, including those relied upon by the appellant, and the\npositive indicators of the appellant’s potential for rehabilitation.The trial\njudge concluded, correctly in my view, that specific deterrence is not a major\nfactor here.His approach to determining a fit sentence was aptly encapsulated\nin the following statement in his reasons:This case is difficult particularly because everything\nabout the offence says jail, and almost everything about the accused says\nconditional sentence; it is the balancing of those matters and determining what\nthe right disposition is that is the most difficult exercise here.[9][9]The trial judge recognized that robbery is a most\nserious crime.That is particularly so when, as here, the use of weapons is\ninvolved, one or more of the victims is injured, the commission of the offence\noccurs late at night and the victims occupy vulnerable and isolated positions.[10][10]The trial judge rejected the defence submission that the appellant’s\nrole in the robberies was minimal.The appellant drove the getaway car, drove\nhis accomplices to the robbery locations, knew the intention to commit the\nrobberies, assisted his accomplices in implementing the second robbery by\ncommunicating with them by cell phone, and facilitated their escape.The trial\njudge observed that the circumstances in this case indicate “a very serious\npublic need for denunciation, general deterrence, and ultimately a period of\nincarceration”.I agree.[11][11]The trial judge was also alert to the appellant’s eligibility for a\nconditional sentence and the fact that robbery is an offence which may attract\na conditional sentence, in a proper case.He considered the applicable\nprinciples enunciated in R. v. Proulx (2000), 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), 140 C.C.C. (3d) 449\n(S.C.C.) and the incidence of robberies in the community in which these crimes\noccurred, as he was entitled to do.[12][12]In balancing all of those factors, the trial judge concluded that a\nconditional sentence was not an appropriate disposition in this case.That\ndecision is entitled to considerable deference from this court.I am not\npersuaded that in rejecting the defence submission for a conditional sentence,\nthe trial judge erred in principle or failed to properly consider and apply the\nrelevant sentencing principles.Accordingly, I would not interfere with that\naspect of his decision.[13][13]It is important however, in my view, to emphasize several other\nfeatures of this case.First, the appellant’s conduct in the robberies is to\nbe contrasted with that of his accomplices.While the appellant’s role was\nserious, and not insignificant, it did not involve the use of violence or\nweapons, an attempt at disguise, threats to the victims of the robberies or\nverbal abuse of them.In contrast to the appellant’s sentence, one of his\naccomplices, a young person whose role in the robberies was materially\ndifferent than that of the appellant, received concurrent sentences of twelve\nmonths secure custody and two years probation on similar robbery counts arising\nfrom the same situation.The different sentence for the appellant was not\nbased on any clear distinction by the trial judge between the role of the\nappellant and the role of the relevant accomplice.Such a comparison would\nhave favoured the appellant.Disparity in sentence is a principle which\ndeserved considerable attention in this case.[14][14]Moreover, the trial judge found that there was evidence of a\nmaturing in the appellant’s thought processes and a recognition by him of the\nshame and disgrace that he visited upon himself and his family.He undertook\nvoluntary counselling prior to his arrest on the offences at issue and, unlike\nhis accomplices, had no prior criminal record.In addition, he was not\ninvolved in any further criminal activity after the robberies and prior to his\narrest on the offences for which he was sentenced by the trial judge.[15][15]In my view, with respect, the reasons of the trial judge do not\nreflect sufficient consideration of the cumulative importance and implications\nof all of the factors described above.Accordingly, I conclude that the proper\njail sentence in this case for the appellant is twelve months, rather than\neighteen months as imposed by the trial judge.(4)Disposition[16][16]For the reasons given, I would grant leave to appeal sentence and\nallow the appeal in part by substituting twelve months incarceration for the\nperiod of eighteen months incarceration imposed by the trial judge.In all\nother respects, I would dismiss the appeal.“E.A.\nCronk, J.A.”“I\nagree Robert P. Armstrong J.A.”O’CONNOR A.C.J.O. (Dissenting):[17][17]I have read the reasons of my colleague, Cronk J.A.Like her, I\nwould not interfere with the trial judge’s decision to impose a custodial\nsentence.However, I am not persuaded that the trial judge erred in imposing a\nterm of imprisonment of eighteen months.[18][18]Although the appellant did not directly use violence or weapons, he\nplayed an integral role in the commission of two very serious offences.His\naccomplices, who were masked and armed, robbed two business establishments in\nwhich there were vulnerable victims working in isolated circumstances at\nnight.The victim of one of the robberies received a cut to his temple\nrequiring six stitches.The need for denunciation and general deterrence was a\nsignificant factor in determining what would be an appropriate sentence.[19][19]In imposing a sentence of eighteen months, the trial judge delivered\nvery careful and thorough reasons.He took into consideration all of the\nappropriate factors, including the personal circumstances of the appellant and\nthe sentences that were imposed on his two accomplices.[20][20]The appellant had no previous criminal record and did not spend any\ntime in pre-trial custody.The accomplices both had criminal records.One of\nthe accomplices, a young offender, received a sentence of twelve months secure\ncustody, together with two years probation.The other, who was an adult\noffender, was sentenced to two years less a day in custody after having served\n191 days of pre-trial custody.[21][21]I do not consider that the sentence of eighteen months imposed on\nthe appellant offends the principle of treating similar offenders and offences\nin a similar manner.In considering whether there is an unacceptable disparity\nbetween the sentence imposed on the appellant and the sentences imposed on the\naccomplices, a comparison to the sentence imposed on the adult accomplice is\nthe more appropriate gauge.The sentencing principles that apply to a young\noffender differ somewhat from those that govern adult offenders.[22][22]Depending on whether one allows 2:1 for the pre-trial custody of the\nadult accomplice, his sentence was the equivalent of either two and a half or\nthree years imprisonment.In my view, a sentence of eighteen months for the\nappellant sufficiently recognizes the lesser role of the appellant in the\noffences and the differences in the personal circumstances of the two\noffenders.[23][23]I am satisfied that the sentence of eighteen months imprisonment\nimposed by the trial judge falls within the appropriate range for this offence\nand this offender.I would, therefore, grant leave to appeal the sentence, but\nwould dismiss the appeal.RELEASED:“OCT 21 2002”“DOC”“D.\nO’Connor A.C.J.O.”"}

The evidence supported a finding of guilt in respect of those three\ncounts. He was tried in respect of the three remaining counts, with Reasons for\nDecision delivered June 2, 2003.[3]I dismissed count #6, being the allegation of uttering a threat, at the\nconclusion of the Crown’s case, on application by the accused. I did this for\nthe reason that there was insufficient evidence relating to this count. In my\nview, the evidence was such that no trier of fact, properly instructed, could\nfind the accused guilty of this count.[4]The trial was concluded in respect of the remaining two counts, being\ncounts #2 and #5, each being an allegation of sexual assault, in respect of\nwhich the accused had pleaded not guilty.Circumstances of the Offences[5]The sole witness for the Crown was Ms. M.O.She was 28 at the time of\nthe trial. She had lived with Mr. Stender as her boyfriend for a year in an\napartment at […] St. in Toronto, until about December 1, 2001. They were consensually intimate over that period. Ms. O. then moved out and to the home of a\nmarried sister in Toronto.[6]The accused testified. It was apparent from the evidence of both the\ncomplainant and the accused that he was obsessed (as he recognized himself at\nthe trial) with Ms. O. and with attempting to revive their previously intimate\nrelationship. As he testified, he was traumatized by the break-up. He testified\nas to how strongly he felt for her, how she had helped him overcome a problem\nwith alcohol in the past, how she had cooked for him, looked after him and\nalways encouraged him when they had lived together. He recognized that his\nbehaviour toward Ms. O. was very irrational and that, as he said, he “was\npretty pathetic.”[7]The complainant’s testimony confirmed Mr. Stender’s obsession with her.\nThe complainant testified that he contacted her daily by e-mail and would drop\nin at her new residence uninvited. Many of the e-mails from Mr. Stender to her\nwould have as attachments, pictures of her naked or engaged in sexual acts with\nthe accused. She testified that she did not consent to these photos and did not\nknow of their existence.[8]Mr. Stender testified that she consented to video camera pictures. He\ntestified that he could stream the video into his computer. Mr. Stender has\nsome expertise in computer application programs. He knew her e-mail account and\npassword. She testified she learned that he was looking at her e-mail\ncorrespondence.[9]I accepted the testimony of the complainant where it was at variance\nwith that of the accused. Moreover, Mr. Stender acknowledged that Ms. O was\nvery upset about the existence of the pictures and wanted them destroyed and\ndeleted from his computer. As well, he acknowledged that he threatened to send\nthe pictures to her friends.[10]Ms. O testified that Mr. Stender often threatened to commit suicide. He\nwas from a rural Ontario community and his only friends were through her.[11]Ms. O testified she did not fear for her personal safety in Mr.\nStender’s company and that he had not hurt her physically to this point in\ntime.[12]Ms. O testified that on January 14, 2001 she and Mr. Stender met in a\npark near her sister’s house in response to a telephone call from him. This was\nsome six weeks after she had ended their relationship. She says he raised the\nname of a former boyfriend of hers and said he had talked with him about Ms. O.\nThey argued and yelled at each other. She said he became angry and called her\nnames. She says he then pushed her in the chest twice, knocking her down and on\nto her back. He apologized afterwards.[13]The next day they communicated by “chat” over the internet.Mr. Stender\nsaid that if she came over to the apartment and had sex with him that he would\ndelete the computer files containing the pictures.She testified that she\ninitially refused but that he then threatened to hurt her by e-mailing the\noffensive photos to her friends such that she would be embarrassed and her\nreputation hurt.[14]Mr. Stender frankly admitted in cross-examination that Ms. O was not\ninterested in having sex except to get rid of the offending computer files. He\nadmitted that he was in effect blackmailing her.[15]She said she went to his apartment January 15, 2001 for the purpose of talking to him and getting the photos deleted. Ms. O testified that he had\nmoved his bed into the living room and had numerous pictures of her on the\nwall. She testified that he was adamant that she must have sex with him as a\ncondition to having the photos deleted from his computer.[16]Ms. O testified that she believed she had no choice. In effect, Mr.\nStender was blackmailing her. She said he started to massage her. He commenced\nto take her clothes off. He applied cocoa cream butter to her body.She was\nwatching television, lying on her stomach with her head propped up on pillows.\nShe says he kissed her. She allowed that she may have kissed him back. She says\nshe pleaded with him but that he insisted on having sex with her before he\nwould delete the photos from his computer.[17]Ms. O testified that she then had intercourse with Mr. Stender. She said\nin cross-examination that she did not know why she did so but perhaps he was\nbeing tender. She said he then showed her the many files on his computer with\nthe photos and that she deleted them herself, deleting them also from the\nrecycling bin.[18]Ms. O testified that the next day she again got e-mails with pictures\nfrom Mr. Stender. She says that in a phone conversation he said she would have\nto return to his apartment again to have sex one more time and delete the\npictures. Apparently, Mr. Stender had been able either to recover the files\ndeleted on January 15 or transmitted to the computer copies of the photos\nretained on the video camera.She says he again threatened to send the\npictures to her friends. She said he again threatened to kill himself and that\nhe wanted to see her one last time before doing so.[19]She said the e-mails with the pictures continued each day until January\n20, 2001 when she met Mr. Stender at a donut shop. She says he told her he\nwanted to have sex with her on one more occasion and that the files had not yet\nbeen deleted. She says she made it plain to him that she did not want to have\nsex with him.[20]Ms. O testified that she returned to Mr. Stender’s apartment January 20.\nShe then learned from Mr. Stender that he had hidden microphones and tape\nrecorders in the bedroom and living room. She said he offered her what he\ncalled a “peace offering”, being a jean jacket.[21]She said he took her clothes off. She says she said she did not want\nthis. She says she tried to give him advice and told him to go back to the town\nin which his parents live. She says she pleaded with him to delete the files\nwith the embarrassing pictures.She said he threatened suicide and threatened\nagain to send e-mails with the pictures to her friends. He admitted he would\nassert that he was suicidal to gain pity and sympathy.[22]She said he pleaded with her to have sex with him. She said she\nsubmitted to having sex on the basis that this was in exchange for having the\nfiles with the photos permanently deleted. She says she felt she had no choice\nbut to let him have his way. She says she got tired of resisting and told him\n“fine” but “if you do this, it is not with M..” She says she shut her eyes and\nclosed herself down mentally. She says that Mr. Stender knew that she did not\nwant to have sex with him and did so only to obtain a deletion of the\nembarrassing photo files.[23]Mr. Stender frankly admitted in cross-examination that he had threatened\nto send the e-mails with the embarrassing pictures to her friends if she did\nnot have sex with him.[24]On January 31, 2001 Ms. O attended at Sunnybrook Hospital for a\npreoperative examination relating to intended surgery in respect of a wrist.\nShe testified that Mr. Stender unexpectedly appeared at the hospital and\nfollowed her about. Mr. Stender said he knew about the appointment and that he\nwanted to see “if there was anything worth pursuing any more.” He says he\n“wanted to rekindle what we once had.” She said that they left together by bus.\nShe said that Mr. Stender did not get off the bus at his own stop but left the\nbus at her stop when she got off. She said he started yelling at her and she\ncalled him a coward. She said he punched her in the stomach and put her in a\nheadlock, squeezing her head.[25]Ms. O is five feet tall and some 95 pounds. Mr. Stender is six feet six\ninches and weighs some 200 pounds. Mr. Stender says he only put his hands over\nher ears and grabbed her because she was enraged.[26]Ms. O testified she told Mr. Stender to “go home” but he said he had to\ngo to the bathroom. She said that when they got to her house her younger sister\nopened the door whereupon Mr. Stender went in and to the bathroom. She said\nthat he then went to her bedroom where she returned the jean jacket to him. She\nsays she repeatedly told him to “get out” whereupon he pushed her against the\nwall and tried to squeeze her neck. At that point the younger sister heard the\ncommotion and told Mr. Stender he must leave immediately, which he did. Mr.\nStender admitted in his own testimony that “I put my hand around her throat,\nmoved her aside and put her against the wall” and then took his hand away.[27]It was apparent from Mr. Stender’s testimony that he was very immature,\nobsessed with Ms. O and also spiteful. Ms. O testified she was very concerned\nabout his claims to commit suicide because he had attempted to do so in the\npast. She said he would claim to be suicidal because he knew this “pulled on my\nheartstrings”.[28]There was little disagreement between the evidence of the complainant\nand the accused as to events.[29]The essence of the factual situation was that Ms. O agreed to have\nsexual intercourse with the accused January 15 and 20, 2001 to secure a\ndeletion of the photos of her. Ms. O was put to a horrible choice.One’s\nrevulsion to Mr. Stender’s despicable actions cannot be overemphasized. His\nactions and motives were morally reprehensible. Hence, the only issue at trial\nwas whether Mr. Stender’s admitted actions amounted to a sexual assault in law\nsuch as to support a conviction under the Criminal Code.[30]Mr. Stender was not charged with extortion. It was not clear on the\nbasis of Crown counsel’s submissions and the existing case law that Mr.\nStender’s actions amounted to a sexual assault in law under the existing\nprovisions of the Criminal Code. Accordingly, the accused was found not\nguilty in respect of the two counts of sexual assault. He was convicted on the\nthree counts of ordinary assault and was sentenced in due course on these\nconvictions. Mr. Stender received a conditional discharge with terms and\nconditions and two years probation in connection with the assault charges.[31]The Crown appealed the finding of not guilty in respect of counts #2 and\n#5 on a question of law. The sentence was not appealed. The Court of Appeal allowed\nthe appeal and entered a conviction. R. v. Stender (2004), 2004 CanLII 7198 (ON CA), 188 C.C.C.\n(3d) 514 (Ont. C.A.).It was held that Mr. Stender’s conduct in threatening to\ndisseminate the photographs unless Ms. O had sex with him amounted to extortion\nas defined in s. 346 (1) of the Code. Her participation in the sexual\nacts was the direct result and the intended consequence of the extortionate\nconduct. Accordingly, it was held Ms. O. did not voluntarily agree to sexual\nactivity with Mr. Stender and it was directed that convictions be entered on\nthose two counts.This conviction was upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada, R.\nv. Stender, unreported June 10, 2005 (S.C.C.).[32]I am now required to sentence Mr. Stender in respect of his convictions\non these two counts of sexual assault.[33]A Presentence Report dated July 21, 2003 was obtained prior to the\nsentencing on the three assault convictions. A further updated Presentence\nReport dated July 17, 2005 (Exhibit #1) was obtained for the purpose of the\nsentencing at hand in respect of the sexual assault convictions. The Victim\nImpact Statement dated May 30, 2003 received at the original sentencing was\nagain considered (Exhibit #2).Circumstances of the Offender[34]Mr. Stender is now 32 years of age. He was 27 at the time of the offences.[35]Mr. Stender reports a happy childhood with caring and supportive\nparents. At this point in time the offender has been under the supervision of\nthe probation and parole officer for some two years. She states that throughout\nthis duration he has presented as a lower risk for reoffence. He has complied\nfully with his supervision plan. He “reported as directed with reliability and\nan openness to engaging in purposeful dialogue.” He reportedly has “faithfully\ncompleted “ a total of 101 hours of community service work. He has not had any\ncontact with the victim. He has abstained from alcohol and non-medically\nprescribed drugs. He attended a 16 session 50 hour program involving\nintervention tools, prevention techniques, problem solving skills and relapse\nprevention planning with respect to domestic violence.[36]Mr. Stender has a grade 12 level of education. Mr. Stender has\nmaintained employment throughout the last two year period and has now secured a\njob with a company involved in highway construction. He has generally been\nemployed since leaving high school in 1995. He resides in a small Ontario town\nwith his spouse whom he married August 23, 2002. they now have a four month old\ndaughter.[37]Mr. Stender had lived with his present spouse and her family for three years\npreviously until 1999, before he met the complainant. His spouse reports Mr.\nStender as being a gentle and kind person who has never been aggressive toward\nher. (This accords with the testimony of the complainant as to the offender’s\nnature in respect of the one year period in which they had lived together.) Mr.\nStender and his spouse live with Mr. Stender’s brother and his family given a\nsignificant debt load because of the costs of the criminal proceedings.[38]Mr. Stender expresses regret for his past actions which have been the\nsubject of the criminal charges. In my view, he is sincere in his expression of\nregret.[39]In brief, all reports indicate that Mr. Stender has fully complied with\nthe conditions of his sentencing on the assault convictions and has followed a\npath of rehabilitation toward responsible citizenship over the past two years.[40]Mr. Stender has no criminal record predating the offences listed in the\nindictment at hand.Considerations in sentencing[41]The definition of a fit and appropriate sentence\nis governed by the purpose and principles of sentencing in ss. 718, 718.1 and\n718.2 of the Criminal Code as applied to the circumstances of the case.\nI am mindful of s. 718 and its statement that the fundamental purpose of\nsentencing is to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to\nrespect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society.\nThis goal is to be achieved by imposing sanctions with the objectives of\ndenouncing unlawful conduct, specific and general deterrence, the separation of\noffenders from society where necessary, rehabilitation, providing reparations\nfor harm, and promoting a sense of responsibility.[42]The circumstances of this case make denunciation\nof the offender’s unlawful conduct, specific deterrence and general deterrence,\ntogether with rehabilitation, objectives for particular consideration in\nrespect of the sentence to be imposed.[43]In my view, the prospects for rehabilitation as\nan objective for sentencing are very significant in this case. The offender is\nyoung. He has no prior criminal record. His behaviour since his conviction on\nthe assault charges has reportedly been exemplary. He has complied fully with\nall the terms of his sentencing in respect of the assault convictions.[44]Without minimizing the seriousness of his sexual\nassault offences, they happened in the context of an immature, impulsive person\nwho was obsessed with the complainant. The Crown states, correctly, that there\nis no evidence of a psychiatric disorder. The Crown states, correctly, that the\nadmitted fact of Mr. Stender’s obsessiveness, in the absence of medical\nevidence, does not mitigate the offence.[45]However, there is an undisputed fact of obsession in the layperson’s use\nof the term. The pre-sentence report notes that in January, 2002 Mr. Stender\nwent to his family doctor and received a referral to a psychiatrist, however,\nhe was arrested before this session was realized. The pre-sentence report notes\nalso that Mr. Stender attended in crisis at the emergency room of Humber RiverRegional Hospital in Weston on January 20, 2002 and that the attending\nphysician’s report states a diagnosis of “emotional upset” and anxiety as a\nresult of the break-up with Ms. O. This is one year (to the day) after the date\nof the second sexual assault but before he was charged and arrested in respect\nof the subject offences. The information was sworn February 6, 2002 with the first court appearance February 8, 2002.[46]Mr. Stender admitted readily at trial his\nunlawful conduct even though he and the complainant were the only witnesses to\nthe incidents. He acknowledges responsibility for his actions. He acknowledges\nthe pathetic stupidity of his actions. He is, in my view, remorseful. He has\ngot on with his life and is doing his best to lead a productive life for the\nbenefit of himself, his family and the community at large.[47]The objectives of denunciation of unlawful\nconduct, and specific and general deterrence must be balanced with the\nobjective of rehabilitation.Submission of the Crown[48]Crown counsel submits that a penitentiary term is appropriate and\nsuggests a sentence of two and one-half years. Crown counsel states that if the\nCourt does not impose a penitentiary term then there should be a sentence to a\nprovincial reformatory for two years less a day, followed by a probation period\nof three years.[49]Crown counsel has provided several cases in support of the Crown’s\nsubmission: R. v. Oyedeji (1987), 3 W.C.B. (2d) 348 (Ont. Dist. Ct.); R.\nv. D.K.P. [1991] B.C.J. No. 2998 (B.C.C.A.); R. v. R.L.B. [1992]\nA.J. No. 826 (Alta. C.A.); R. v. P.M.H. [1992] O.J. No.2715 (Gen. Div.);\nR. v. Davis [1993] N.J. 257 (Nfld. C.A.); R. v. Cerasuolo, 2001 CanLII 24172 (ON CA), [2001]\nO.J.No.359 (C.A.); and R. v. Alexandruk, [2003] A.J. No. 78 (Alta. Prov.\nCt.).These cases included situations of extortion for sex (Oyedeji, P.M.H.)\nand extortion for monetary benefits through the threat to publish sexually\nexplicit photographs (D.K.P and R.L.B.). All of the cited cases\ninvolved sentences of prison terms.[50]I do not intend to dissect the cited cases in detailed contrast to the\none at hand. All of the cited cases involved egregious offences. The case at\nhand also involves an egregious situation. It is fair to say that sexual\nassault and extortion are always outrageous crimes deserving of severe punishment.\nIn particular, sexual assault is a crime of violence, evidencing extreme\nanti-social conduct. I would go so far as to say the normative sentence in such\nsituations will involve a sentence of incarceration. But while sentencing must,\nof course, take place within the framework of established principles set forth\nby the Code and established precedents, the sentence must be\ncase-specific to the evidentiary record, factual base and particular, unique\ncircumstances in the given situation before the Court.[51]Taking into account the entirety of the circumstances of the case at\nhand, in my view, an appropriate sentence would be in the range of twelve to\neighteen months in a provincial prison. I sentence the offender, Mr. Stender,\nto a prison term of fifteen months for each sexual assault conviction, with the\nsentences to be served concurrently.[52]This then brings us to the question as to whether the sentence is to be\nserved through incarceration or by way of a conditional sentence to be served\nin the community, considering the criteria set forth in s. 742.1. The sentence\nimposed is one that is less than two years. The second criterion is that the\nCourt is to be satisfied that serving the sentence in the community “would not\nendanger the safety of the community.”[53]The Supreme Court of Canada emphasizes in R.\nv. Proulx (2000), 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), 140 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (S.C.C.) that the 1996 sentencing\nreforms seen with the conditional sentence order “must be understood as a\nreaction to the overuse of prison as a sanction, and must accordingly be given\nappropriate force as remedial provisions (para. 16). Restorative justice\ninvolves some form of restitution and reintegration into the community. The\nneed for offenders to take responsibility for their actions is central to the\nsentencing process.[54]While incarceration is generally a harsher\nsanction, a conditional sentence may be as onerous as, or conceivably even more\nonerous than a jail term in certain circumstances.[55]“Safety of the Community” refers to the threat\nposed by the specific offender. To assess the danger to the community posed by\nthe offender while serving his sentence in the community, two factors must be\ntaken into account: (1) the risk of the offender re-offending; and (2) the\ngravity of the damage that could ensue in the event of re-offence. (Proulx\nat para. 69). The offender at hand has no prior criminal record and has been\nsubject to probation for the two years without any apparent breach of\nconditions. The level of supervision in the community is a major factor in\nminimizing the risk of re-offending as well as the imposition of appropriate\nconditions of sentence. Mr. Stender is living in a supportive environment in\nterms of his immediate and extended family. Considering all the factors, I am\nsatisfied that Mr. Stender serving his sentence in the community would not\nendanger the safety of the community. Indeed, Crown counsel allows that this\ncriterion has been met.[56]Assuming the sentencing judge is satisfied that\nthe offender would not endanger the community, a consideration is to then be\nmade whether a conditional sentence “would be consistent with the fundamental\npurpose and principles of sentencing” set forth in the Code.[57]It is clear that a conditional sentence is\navailable in principle for all offences in which the statutory prerequisites\nare satisfied (Proulx, paras. 79, 80, 81 and 83). Sentencing is an\nindividualized process with considerable discretion conferred upon the trial\njudge in fashioning a fit sentence.[58]A sentence must be proportional to the gravity\nof the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender. A conditional\nsentence can achieve both punitive and restorative objectives.[59]I turn now to the question whether a conditional\nsentence is appropriate in the case at hand having regard to the sentencing objectives\nset out in s. 718. In sentencing, ajudge must engage in the ”delicate art” of\nbalancing carefully “the societal goals of sentencing against the moral\nblameworthiness of the offender and the circumstances of the offence.” R. v.\nPriest (1996), 1996 CanLII 1381 (ON CA), 110 C.C.C. (3d) 289 (Ont. C.A.) per Rosenberg, J.A.[60]Denunciation represents the communication of\nsociety’s condemnation of the offender’s conduct. (Proulx para. 102.)\nDenunciation through a conditional sentence order can often be achieved by\nconditions that have a punitive aspect, such as with house arrest, and/or with\nthe duration of the conditional sentence imposed extending beyond the duration\nof the jail sentence that would ordinarily be imposed.[61]There is uncertainty as to whether deterrence is\nmore likely achieved with incarceration. The commonly expressed view is that\nthe empirical evidence suggests that the deterrent effect of incarceration is\nuncertain. See generally Sentencing Reform: A Canadian Approach: Report of\nthe Canadian Sentencing Commission (1987) at pp. 136-37, cited in Proulx\nat para. 107)[62]However, it is noted that the more recent\nempirical work of the eminent economist, Professor Steven Levitt of the University of Chicago, suggests that incarceration may indeed deter. See The\nEconomist, January 10, 2004.[63]Restorative sentencing objectives, including\nrehabilitation, reparation and promotion of a sense of responsibility are\ngenerally viewed as more likely to be achieved through a conditional sentence\norder than with incarceration.[64]It is advantageous when assessing and weighing\nthe factors relevant to a sentencing to have heard the testimony, and seen the\nwitnesses, at trial. The Crown counsel making submissions as to sentencing was\nnot the Crown counsel at trial (and had not read the transcript nor the Reasons\nfor Decision at trial in advance of his sentencingsubmissions.)[65]Crown counsel emphasized the horrific experience\nfor the complainant. It was unquestionably horrific, as it would be for any\nwoman.The complainant has set forth her comments as to her ordeal in a\nwell-written, articulate and thorough victim impact statement dated May 31, 2003. She refers to the despicable\nmanipulation of her vulnerability by the offender in clear and poignant\nlanguage.[66]Ms. O impressed me in her oral testimony at\ntrial as someone who is very strong, tough and resilient (as she notes herself\nin her statement) and someone able to overcome these wretched events and get on\nwith her life, notwithstanding the trauma of the past offences. She very\nunderstandably evidenced a great deal of anger toward Mr. Stender and very\nunderstandably evidenced a wish to see a strong denunciation and condemnation\nof his misconduct.[67]Crown counsel submits that the objective of\ngeneral deterrence trumps the objective of rehabilitation in the circumstances\nof the sentencing at hand. I disagree. In my view, all the objectives of\nsentencing must be met but a suitable balancing requires recognition of the\nimportance of the objective of rehabilitation.[68]Considering all the circumstances and balancing\nthe interests seen in the principles of sentencing, in my view my discretion is\nto be exercised with a conditional sentence, to be served in the community.[69]Mr. Stender’s sentence of fifteen months is to\nbe served in the community in accordance with a conditional sentence order, for\neach of the two sexual assaults, and followed by a one year probation.[70]I order that the offender shall serve his\nsentence in the community, The mandatory terms required by section 742.3 to be\nimposed in respect of the offender are as follows:(a)that he be of good behaviour and keep the peace;(b)that he appears before the Court when required\nto do by the Court;(c)that he reports to a supervisor within two\nworking days after the making of this order, and thereafter as he may be\nrequired by the supervisor;(d)that he notifies the Court or the supervisor in\nadvance of any change of name or address, and promptly notifies the Court or\nsupervisor of any change of employment or occupation.[71]In addition, as further optional terms imposed\nin exercising the discretion of the Court:(a)he is to perform 100 hours of community service as may be assigned\nto him by his supervisor considering the talents of the offender and the needs\nof the community, to be completed within 10 months with a minimum of 10 hours\nto be performed in each and every month until the entire 100 hours has been\nperformed;(b) he is to remain under house arrest\nat his residential premises for a period of ten months, being until July 20,\n2006, subject to the following exceptions: he may leave the premises to go to\nand from and perform his duties of employment at his place(s) of employment; he\nmay leave the premises for the purpose of performing and going to and from the\nplace(s) of performing his community service; he may leave his premises for the\npurpose of attending any rehabilitative program prescribed by his supervisor;\nhe may attend upon a physician or hospital in respect of any emergency medical\ntreatment required in respect of himself or any member of his family; he may\nleave the premises for up to three consecutive hours on Saturdays for any\npersonal purpose provided he is in his residence not later than 5:00 pm; he may\ngo to and from any place of worship for the purpose of attending religious\nservices therein provided he has advised his supervisor in advance; and he may\nbe occasionally absent from his premises for any purpose seen as reasonable and\nnecessary by his supervisor provided the supervisor has given approval in\nwriting in advance;(c) at the end of the ten month period\nof his house arrest he is to observe a curfew for the balance of his\nconditional sentence, being five months, by remaining in his residence between\nthe hours of 10:00 pm each day until 6:00 am the next day, until December 20, 2006;\nprovided however, he may leave the premises in the event of any emergency\nmedical treatment required in respect of himself or his family; and he may be\nabsent from his premises during the curfew hours for any purpose seen as\nreasonable and necessary by his supervisor provided the supervisor has given\napproval in writing in advance.(d)he is to abstain from the\nconsumption of any alcohol or drugs other than those prescribed by a licenses\nmedical physician;(e) he is not to have nay communication,\ndirectly or indirectly, with the complainant or any member of her family;(f) he is to maintain his full-time\nemployment and support his spouse and child; and(g) he is to attend and actively\nparticipate in Domestic Violence Intervention Programming and /or any such\nother rehabilitative program(s) as his supervisor may direct in the\nsupervisor’s discretion and pay any fee (s) required of him.[72]Pursuant to s. 742.3(3), I order that he be\ngiven a copy of this order of the Court.[73]Additionally, I am required by s. 742.3(3) to\nexplain to the offender the substance of ss. 742.4 and 742.6, relevant to the\nprocedures relating to changes to the optional conditions and the procedure\napplicable upon a breach of any condition.[74]The supervisor may, because of a change in\ncircumstances, propose a change to an optional condition upon notice to the\noffender, to the prosecutor and to the Court in writing indicating the proposed\nchange and reasons for it. Upon receiving such a notice, the offender or the\nprosecutor or the Court may require a hearing to be held for the purposes of\neither allowing or refusing the changes or making any other change which the\nCourt deems appropriate.[75]The procedure relating to a breach of any one of\nthe conditions, whether mandatory or optional, is explained as follows. Upon a\nbreach of a condition, the offender may be arrested and charged with the\noffence of breaching a condition pursuant to s.242.6 of the Criminal Code.\nThe offender may be required to appear before a justice who may order him detained\nor released on conditions, and the allegation of breach of condition may then\nbe tried by a Court having jurisdiction.[76]The allegation of breach of condition must be\nsupported by a written report of the supervisor and signed statements of\nwitnesses, if any. The prosecutor is required to give the offender reasonable\nnotice and a copy of the report. Where the Court is satisfied on a “balance of\nprobabilities”, being the same test which applies in civil cases, that the\noffender has breached the condition without reasonable excuse, the Court may\neither (a) take no action, or (b) change an optional condition, or (c) suspend\nthe conditional sentence order and direct that a portion or all of the\nunexpired sentence be served in prison rather than in the community.[77]In addition, the offender is also placed on\nprobation for a one year period following upon the expiration of the term of\nhis conditional sentence order, on the following terms and conditions:(a)he reports to and is under the direction of a probation officer as\nrequired by the probation officer;(b)he makes reasonable efforts to maintain\nfull-time employment or embarks upon or continues with full-time education;(c)he abstains from the consumption of alcohol and\nany drugs not prescribed by a licensed medical physician.[78]The offender, having been convicted of sexual\nassault, being a “primary designated offence”, is to be subject to an order\nunder s. 487.051(1)(a) of the Code authorizing the taking from him of\nany number of one or more bodily substances that is reasonably required for the\npurpose of forensic DNA analysis. I am satisfied that the impact by such order\nupon the offender’s privacy and security of person is not grossly\ndisproportionate to the public interest in the protection of society and the proper\nadministration of justice.[79]Crown counsel has made an application under s.\n490.012 for an order in Form 52 requiring Mr. Stender to comply with the Sex\nOffender Information Act, given that sexual assault is a “designated\noffence” under s. 490.011(1) (a). The offender has not sought to establish\nunder s. 490.012(4) that an exceptional exemption should be made. Accordingly,\nsuch order is to issue.[80]This concludes my sentencing and reasons for\nsentence.__________________CUMMING\nJ.Released:September 20, 2005COURT\nFILE NO.: 02-PR808DATE:\n20050920ONTARIOSUPERIOR COURT OF JUSTICEB E T W E E N:HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN- and -DAVID STENDERREASONSFOR DECISIONCUMMINGJ.Released:September 20, 2005"}

H. Smallwood, at Fort Smith in the NorthwestTerritories, on February 28th A.D., 2014._________________________________________________________APPEARANCES:Ms. K. Lakusta:Counsel for the CrownMr. M. Hansen:Counsel for the Accused----------------------------------------An order has been made banning publication of theidentity of the Complainant/Witness pursuant to Section486.4 of the Criminal Code of CanadaOfficial Court Reporters1THE COURT:Jason Frank Paulette was2found guilty by a jury on January 17th, 20143for committing a sexual assault causing bodily4harm which occurred on December 8th, 2011.5Sentencing was adjourned and yesterday I heard6submissions from the Crown and the defence as7to what sentence should be imposed.8There is a publication ban prohibiting the9publication and broadcast of any information10that could identify the complainant in this11matter.I don't intend to refer to the12complainant by name but if there are portions13of my reasons where I do refer to her by name,14I am going to direct the court reporter to15refer to the complainant by her initials.16There can be no publication or broadcast of17any information that could disclose the18complainant's identity.19The Crown is seeking a sentence of six to20eight years imprisonment less credit for21remand time, and Mr. Paulette's counsel says22an appropriate sentence is three and a half to23four years less credit for remand time.24The evidence heard at trial was that the25complainant went to Mr. Paulette's residence26the evening of December 7th, 2011.27Mr. Paulette is her cousin and she went overOfficial Court Reporters11because she knew that his common-law spouse2was out of town and she thought that she would3help him out with his children and have dinner4with him.She spent the evening at his5residence and they smoked marijuana and drank6beer.After dinner, the complainant went to7the liquor store and bought some beer and when8she returned, they smoked the marijuana and9drank the beer.Mr. Paulette also touched up10a tattoo on the complainant's ankle with his11tattoo gun.12While Mr. Paulette was working on the13complainant's tattoo, the complainant was14texting a friend on her phone.She was15texting her friend throughout the evening.16Mr. Paulette got mad at the complainant for17being constantly on the phone.She thought it18was a joke at first but she realized he was19serious when he slapped the back of her head.20She was scared and put her phone away.21The complainant then went upstairs to the22bathroom.While she was in the bathroom she23blacked out.When she came to again, she was24on the bathroom floor and Jason Paulette was25choking her.She faked being unconscious so26he would get off of her, which he did.He27went downstairs and she pulled up her pantsOfficial Court Reporters21and went downstairs.The complainant then2began freaking out and asking Mr. Paulette how3he could do this to her.Mr. Paulette punched4her in the face, which cut her chin.Blood5went all over her clothes and on the floor.6The complainant continued yelling at7Mr. Paulette and he grabbed her by the neck8and pushed her to the floor and used her hair9to mop up the blood.He told her to \"shut the10fuck up, you stupid bitch\".The complainant11blacked out again and the next thing she12remembered was putting on her shoes and13running out the door into the minus 40 degree14weather, leaving behind her jacket, cell15phone, iPod, and a bag of clothes.When she16left the residence she did not know where17Jason Paulette was.18The complainant ran over to her friend19Ashleigh Stokes' residence which was a short20distance away.At Ms. Stokes' residence, she21knocked on the door.When there was no22immediate answer, she began banging on the23door, yelling and crying.24Ms. Stokes answered the door.The25complainant, in her evidence, testified that26Ashleigh Stokes asked her what happened and27she tried her best to explain.She was unableOfficial Court Reporters31to recall the words that she said when talking2to Ashleigh Stokes.There were portions of3the night that the complainant does not4remember as a result of blacking out due to5the consumption of alcohol and marijuana.She6does not recall any sexual relations with7Jason Paulette that night and said that she8did not consent to any sexual relations with9Jason Paulette.10Ashleigh Stokes also testified at the11trial and her evidence corroborates the12complainant's testimony about when the13complainant came to her residence early that14morning.15Ms. Stokes said that she was asleep at her16residence that morning.At around 4:30, she17heard knocking on her door.Initially she was18not going to answer the door but then she19heard yelling and screaming and realized that20it was the complainant so she got up and21answered the door.When she opened the door,22she saw the complainant, who was crying, her23hair was messy, there was blood on her face,24and she was shivering.She was not wearing a25jacket.She was wearing a sweater and jeans26which was not appropriate for the cold27weather.Official Court Reporters41The complainant said to Ashleigh Stokes2\"my cousin raped me\" over and over again.She3asked the complainant \"your cousin who?\" to4which the complainant responded \"my cousin5Jason raped me\".6Ashleigh Stokes took the complainant to7the hospital.A sexual assault examination8was later completed and Jason Paulette's9spermatozoa was located in the vaginal swab10and vaginal pool sample taken from the11complainant.12As the jury convicted Mr. Paulette of13sexual assault causing bodily harm, they must14have accepted the complainant's evidence about15the violence inflicted upon her by Mr.16Paulette which caused the injuries depicted in17the photographs.And they must have also18concluded that the assault causing bodily harm19occurred in circumstances of a sexual nature.20Defence counsel suggests that I cannot21conclude that the sexual intercourse between22Mr. Paulette and the complainant was23nonconsensual.He says there is simply not24enough evidence to draw a conclusion and that25a sexual assault causing bodily harm can arise26in circumstances where there was consensual27sexual contact which caused bodily harm.Official Court Reporters51In circumstances where the jury's verdict2leaves some ambiguity with respect to the3facts on which they have come to their4verdict, it is the obligation of the5sentencing Judge to come to their own6independent determination of the facts7consistent with the jury's verdict.I do not8have to come to a complete theory of the facts9but only to make those factual determinations10necessary to decide the appropriate sentence.11That is from The Queen v. Ferguson, a decision12of the Supreme Court of Canada from 2008.13In this case, the complainant, despite the14problems with her memory, was clear about what15she did remember.16She testified that in the basement, Jason17Paulette slapped the back of her head when she18was spending too much time on her phone.She19was scared and put the phone away.Prior to20this, they had not had sexual intercourse and21there had been no discussion of sexual22intercourse or any interactions of a sexual23nature.Then the complainant went upstairs to24the bathroom.While sitting on the toilet,25she blacked out.When she came to, she was on26the bathroom floor being choked by Jason27Paulette.When she feigned unconsciousness,Official Court Reporters61he stopped choking her and left the bathroom.2She pulled up her pants and went downstairs to3confront him and wanted to know how he could4do this to her.His response was to punch her5in the face which caused her chin to bleed.6She continued to yell at him, and he grabbed7her by the neck and pushed her to the floor8and used her hair to mop up the blood.She9blacked out again and when she came to, she10fled the residence.11Sometime during this series of events,12Jason Paulette would have had sexual13intercourse with the complainant.While the14complainant has no memory of the sexual15intercourse, I conclude that it was16nonconsensual.And I come to this conclusion17based upon the evidence and the circumstances18as related at trial.19The complainant blacked out in the20bathroom and her memories following that event21all involve Jason Paulette choking or22assaulting her.When she comes to in the23bathroom, she is being choked and her pants24are down and Jason Paulette is on top of her.25When she goes downstairs, he again assaults26her and she blacks out.It seems incredible27that consensual sexual intercourse would haveOfficial Court Reporters71occurred in these circumstances.2In addition, the complainant, when she3fled to Ashleigh Stokes' residence, told4Ashleigh Stokes that her cousin Jason had5raped her.This was a spontaneous utterance6which was subject to a voir dire at the trial.7While the complainant's injuries corroborate8that she had been assaulted, no one at that9point would suspect that there had been a10sexual aspect to what had happened to her11until she had said that she had been raped.12And when I say that, I mean she did not show13up at Ashleigh Stokes' residence naked or14missing clothing so that it would be clearer15to an observer that something sexual might16have happened.The complainant had no17knowledge of whether there would be any DNA18evidence and only she, when speaking with19Ashleigh Stokes, would have had knowledge of20the sexual contact between her and the21accused.At that point she had no reason to22lie about being sexually assaulted by the23accused.So when she said to Ashleigh Stokes24that her cousin Jason raped her, why would she25say that unless the intercourse between them26was not consensual?27The complainant's level of intoxicationOfficial Court Reporters81also raises concerns about her capacity to2consent to sexual intercourse.She had drank3beer and smoked marijuana to the point that4she blacked out several times during the5evening.As Jason Paulette was present while6the complainant consumed drugs and alcohol, he7should have been aware that the complainant8had consumed enough drugs and alcohol that her9capacity to consent due to intoxication might10be compromised.11In the circumstances, I find that Jason12Paulette had nonconsensual sexual intercourse13with the complainant.As stated above, I do14not need to come to a complete theory about15the facts so, other than saying that the16nonconsensual sexual intercourse happened17during a period when the complainant was18blacked out, I do not think it necessary to19come to a conclusion as to exactly when it20occurred in the sequence of events that night.21The complainant did not provide a victim22impact statement.Her father Wilfred Paulette23provided a brief one in which he wrote about24the impact this offence has had on the25complainant.It has been difficult for the26complainant to see the accused after the27offence, seeing him walking around on theOfficial Court Reporters91street as he was on release for a period of2time.She has had struggles with alcohol and3it continues to be tough for her to deal with4the offence.She is going to school and has5the support of her family.6I have no doubt that based on the facts,7hearing the complainant testify and seeing the8photographs of her injuries, that it has been9difficult for her.She suffered physical10injuries and emotional trauma.It will take11her time to heal and the psychological scars12may never heal.13Mr. Paulette, you and your lawyer spoke of14your problems, the issues that you need to15deal with, and the abuse that you suffered16while growing up.I hope you realize that17what you did to the complainant is similar to18what happened to you.You took the trust, the19trust of a family member, the relationship20that you had with the complainant, and broke21it in a violent and degrading way.You hurt22her physically and mentally, and I am not sure23that you fully appreciate that.But I hope24that, as part of a healing process that you do25come to that realization.26Mr. Paulette has a criminal record which27has been filed as an exhibit, and it is aOfficial Court Reporters101significant one.By my count, there are 332convictions on his criminal record and there3are some convictions which raise concerns for4the Court.5Mr. Paulette's criminal record begins in61993 with property offences and includes7numerous offences against the administration8of justice over the years.There are also9offences of violence.In 1995, he was10convicted of assault causing bodily harm and11received a fine and probation.In 1999, he12was convicted of assault and received a13sentence of a suspended sentence and14probation.In 2001, he was convicted of15assault, spousal assault, and a spousal16assault causing bodily harm, along with other17offences, and received a global sentence of 1218months.In 2010, Mr. Paulette was convicted19of a sexual assault and received a sentence of2021 months which was essentially a sentence of21time served as he had served ten and a half22months of remand time which was credited at23the rate of two to one.He was at that time24placed on a three year probation order which25required him to comply with a number of26conditions.And following his arrest on this27offence, he has three further convictionsOfficial Court Reporters111which have been entered for failing to comply2with conditions of his release.3Mr. Paulette is an aboriginal person and4this requires me to consider Section 718.2(e)5of the Criminal Code which states:6All available sanctions other than7imprisonment that are reasonable8in the circumstances should be9considered for all offenders, with10particular attention to the11circumstances of aboriginal12offenders.13The Supreme Court of Canada has given14directions to trial courts in how to interpret15this section in Gladue and, more recently, in16Ipeelee.I have considered the principles set17out in those cases and the requirement to18consider the unique systemic or background19factors which may have played a part in20bringing an aboriginal offender before the21Court and the type of sentencing procedures22and sanctions which might be appropriate23taking into account the circumstances of an24aboriginal offender's background.25I have heard that Jason Paulette is a26child of parents who attended residential27school and has suffered as a result of whatOfficial Court Reporters121happened to them.His parents struggled with2alcohol, abuse was a part of their lives, and3their ability to parent was negatively4affected by their residential school5experience.This obviously affected6Mr. Paulette to be surrounded, to witness this7on a daily basis can only have a negative8effect on a child.9I have also heard that Mr. Paulette was a10victim of sexual abuse by a family member and11it is apparent this has also had a profound12effect upon him and it is one that he is only13recently beginning to deal with.14Counsel for Mr. Paulette made thorough and15thoughtful submissions regarding16Mr. Paulette's background, and I won't repeat17everything that counsel and Mr. Paulette said18yesterday, but it is apparent that he has been19negatively affected by many of the factors20that are referred to in Gladue and Ipeelee.21But within this, I also heard some positive22things.23Mr. Paulette has a close relationship with24his mother and was very fond of his25great-great grandmother with whom he lived for26a period of time.They were, and in the case27of his mother, continue to be loving andOfficial Court Reporters131supportive parts of his life.He is also in a2loving relationship with his common-law spouse3who is committed to standing by him and4dealing with their problems.He has four5children who he loves and wants to be a better6father to.7Mr. Paulette's situation, while unique to8him, is not unusual in this jurisdiction.It9is unfortunate, heartbreaking really, but many10offenders who come before this Court have11lives that have been devastated by abuse and12the abuse of alcohol.Offenders have13witnessed their parents and family members14abuse each other and abuse alcohol.They have15begun abusing alcohol often at a relatively16young age and continue to do so as they grow17up and have children, and their abuse of18alcohol begins to affect their children.It19is a cycle that I hope you can break, Mr.20Paulette; if not for your sake then for your21children.22I accept there are factors in23Mr. Paulette's background which are relevant24to his aboriginal heritage and which25contribute to him being before this Court26today.At the same time the paramount27sentencing principles have to be deterrenceOfficial Court Reporters141and denunciation, which I will discuss2further.Overall, I do not think that the3factors referred to in Gladue and Ipeelee that4are applicable here are such that they can5involve consideration of anything but a6custodial sentence; and indeed, counsel for7Mr. Paulette is not suggesting that there is a8viable alternative to custody.9As acknowledged in Gladue, the more10violent and serious the offence the more11likely that a sentence of imprisonment for12aboriginal and non-aboriginal offenders will13be the same or close to the same.I have14taken the factors in Section 718.2(e) into15account in the overall sentencing.16There are a number of sentencing17principles that are engaged in this case.The18purposes and principles of sentencing are set19out in the Criminal Code.I am not going to20refer to all of them but I have considered the21principles enunciated in Section 718 to22Section 718.2.23The fundamental principle of sentencing is24that a sentence must be proportionate to the25gravity of the offence and the degree of26responsibility of the offender.The27fundamental purpose of sentencing is toOfficial Court Reporters151contribute to respect for the law and the2maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe3society by imposing just sanctions that have4one or more of the following objectives: to5denounce unlawful conduct; to deter the6offender and other persons from committing7offences; to separate offenders from society,8where necessary; and to assist in9rehabilitating offenders; to provide10reparations for harm done to victims or to the11community; to promote a sense of12responsibility in offenders, and13acknowledgment of the harm done to victims and14to the community.All of these factors are15applicable to one extent or another in this16case.17Crown and defence have each filed a book18of authorities with several cases and have19made very thorough helpful submissions.None20of the cases are exactly the same as this case21and even if they were, each sentencing has to22be approached individually taking into account23the facts of the offence and the circumstances24of the individual offender.The cases are25helpful in determining an appropriate range of26sentence and determining what sentencing27principles should be considered.Official Court Reporters161Sexual assault is a crime that occurs far2too often in the Northwest Territories.3As stated in The Queen v. Lafferty, 20114NWTSC 60 at paragraph 37:5Sexual assault is a crime that isterribly prevalent in the6Northwest Territories.ThisCourt, sadly, has cause to comment7on this fact very often becausethis Court very often has the task8of sentencing people for the crimeof sexual assault.These cases9seem to be happening in almostevery community in this10jurisdiction.They are committedby young people, middle-aged11people, sometimes older people.In particular, sexual assaults12committed against women or younggirls who are passed out or13intoxicated to the point of notbeing able to resist are very14frequent.15And it goes on later in the paragraph,16The fact that it happens sofrequently does not make it any17more understandable, does not makeit any less disturbing, and18certainly does not make it anyless wrong.1920I completely agree with the comments21expressed in Lafferty.It is sometimes hard22to believe that this offence occurs so often23in this jurisdiction, that a person can24demonstrate a complete disregard for the25sexual integrity of another person.And when26it is combined with the violence that was27present in this case, it is disheartening.Official Court Reporters171Because of the prevalence of this type of2offence in this jurisdiction, Courts have3repeatedly said that the sentencing principles4of deterrence and denunciation should be5emphasized.6Turning to the factors that are applicable7in this case, I do not see that there are any8mitigating factors.For example, Mr. Paulette9has not entered a guilty plea which can be a10significant mitigating factor.Mr. Paulette11had a trial, which is his right and it is not12aggravating that he did so, but what that13means is he does not get the mitigating effect14on sentencing of a guilty plea.15Mr. Paulette has not expressed any remorse16for this offence.An expression of remorse,17even after a trial, can have some weight.He18said that he hoped that the complainant would19get the treatment that she needed but I did20not hear any expression of remorse for what he21did to the complainant.22There are a number of aggravating factors23in this case.24The complainant was Mr. Paulette's first25cousin.They had a family relationship and26there was an element of trust in that27relationship.I agree with defence counselOfficial Court Reporters181that this was not a trust relationship per se2as exists in a spousal relationship or a3student/teacher relationship, but there is an4element of trust that arises in a family5situation.The complainant felt comfortable6enough to go to her cousin Mr. Paulette's7residence when his common-law spouse was away8and wanted to help him with his children.Mr.9Paulette's actions have shattered that trust10and this has had a broader impact than just on11the relationship between Mr. Paulette and the12complainant.It has caused a rift in their13family.14It is also aggravating that this offence15occurred while children were present in the16home.One of the more heartbreaking parts of17the evidence was hearing the complainant18testify that during the events one of the19children of Mr. Paulette was present and20witnessed part of what her father did to the21complainant.The complainant testified that22the daughter was crying.Just as Mr. Paulette23remembers his father abusing his mother, his24daughter will likely remember what she saw and25be negatively affected by what she witnessed.26The complainant in this case suffered27injuries which is obvious because Mr. PauletteOfficial Court Reporters191was convicted of sexual assault causing bodily2harm.But aside from that, there was3considerable violence inflicted on the4complainant.She was slapped, choked,5punched, pushed to the floor and her hair used6to mop up her own blood.Any one of these7acts of violence are objectionable but the8extreme violence inflicted upon the9complainant by Mr. Paulette is reprehensible.10I have already referred to Mr. Paulette's11criminal record but I want to speak more12specifically about the prior sexual assault on13his criminal record.14He was convicted of sexual assault on15April 26th, 2010.At that time he received a16sentence of time served which, as I mentioned,17was equivalent to 21 months in jail and a18three year probation order was imposed upon19him.He was required to comply with a number20of conditions, including not to consume or21possess alcohol.So at the time of this22offence he was still on his probation order,23he was consuming alcohol, and committed the24same type of offence for which he was on25probation.So I find that it was aggravating26that he was on probation at the time of this27offence and that he was specifically violatingOfficial Court Reporters201a term of his probation.2As I have mentioned, this is an offence3which was committed while Mr. Paulette was4under the influence of alcohol and drugs.Mr.5Paulette's counsel tells me that Mr. Paulette6wants to get help for his problems, including7his alcohol problem, and I think that8acknowledging that you have a problem is a9good first step and there are many more steps10to go in the healing process but I am hopeful11that this is a beginning.12The Crown filed a transcript of the13reasons for sentence from 2010 in their book14of authorities.In that case, Mr. Paulette15pled guilty on the day of his jury trial.The16facts in that case were that the complainant,17who was 16 years old, went to her aunt's house18because she was locked out of her residence.19Mr. Paulette was there and he was known to20her.She went into the house.She went to21the bathroom and when she emerged,22Mr. Paulette forced her into a bedroom and23onto a bed.He held her by the neck and had24sexual intercourse with her.25There are some similarities to the case26before the Court today.I note the comments27of Justice Cooper, when he stated at page 9:Official Court Reporters211Let there be no mistake.This wasa brutal and egregious act of2violence, a predatory offencewhere the accused displayed total3disregard for the personal andbodily integrity of this416-year-old girl.5In that case, there was a joint submission6of 21 months which, as I have said, was a7sentence of time served.The Court, in8passing sentence, acknowledged that the9sentence may seem inadequate but considered it10a unique case given the strong family support11and prospects for rehabilitation.I view the12sentence that you received, Mr. Paulette, in13the circumstances of that case as at the low14end of the range.Indeed, acknowledging the15principles that bind a Court when a joint16sentence is presented, I am of the view that17you received a significant break.And I am18saying this because I think that you were19given an opportunity that many offenders are20not.The Court took a chance on your21rehabilitation and heard that you were taking22programs while in jail and had strong family23support and strong prospects for24rehabilitation.So it is unfortunate that you25are here again today.26Now I have heard that your father was not27there for you, did not follow up with theOfficial Court Reporters221commitment that he made, and that too is2unfortunate.But ultimately you are here3today in the same position because of the4choices that you made.And that's where5taking responsibility for who you are and what6you have done comes into play.Despite your7past and the failures of your family, you are8still responsible for your actions.9So, Mr. Paulette, the sentence that I am10about to impose I hope sends several messages.11First, it expresses society's condemnation of12your conduct.What that means is that the13people of the Northwest Territories, the14people of Fort Smith, do not think it is okay15to violently sexually assault someone.They16are disgusted by this type of behaviour.17Secondly, it must deter other people from18contemplating doing this type of thing.So it19has to tell people that this is the type of20sentence that you will face if you choose to21act the way that Mr. Paulette did, and22hopefully this sentence will make them think23twice.24And lastly, it must specifically deter25you, and when I say that I mean you never26sexually assault another person again.27I also think it is necessary to separateOfficial Court Reporters231you from society.As it stands, you pose a2risk to women, particularly when you are under3the influence of alcohol or drugs.And4separation from society will also permit you5to take programs and attempt to deal with your6issues so hopefully you can be rehabilitated7and I do think your rehabilitation is8important.But in the circumstances, it9cannot be the primary sentencing objective but10it is still an important factor.11Mr. Paulette was originally released on12this -- he was in custody on this offence from13December 8th, 2011 to April 4th, 2012.He was14on consent remand.He was released after a15show cause and was on conditions for a period16of time but was placed back into custody again17on October 17th, 2013.He was sentenced on18November 20th, 2013 to a sentence of four19months for two breaches.At that time his20pre-trial custody to that point, which I take21being the custody that he had most recently22served, was taken into account, so the 11823days which had previously been his remand24time, was not taken into account in that25sentence.So his sentence on the four months26would have expired on January 15th, 2014.On27January 23rd, 2014, Mr. Paulette was sentencedOfficial Court Reporters241to another 30 days consecutive for another2breach.And that sentence would have expired3on February 18, 2014.4So for this offence, today, there are5three periods that I understand for which6Mr. Paulette has not received credit for his7pre-trial custody.So the period from8December 8th, 2011 to April 4th, 2012; from9January 15th to 23rd; and February 18th to10today, of this year, which comes to 126 days11of pre-trial custody.12Now, pursuant to Section 719(3.1) of the13Criminal Code, the maximum credit available14for Mr. Paulette's remand time could be up to15one and a half days for each day spent in16custody, which can be granted if the17circumstances justify it.18The issue of what circumstances justify an19increase up to one and a half days credit for20each day in custody has been the subject of21some litigation and differences across Canada.22However, it has been accepted in this Court23that the circumstances that can justify24enhanced credit do not have to be exceptional25or only occur in rare situations.They do26however have to be applicable to the specific27accused who is before the Court.Official Court Reporters251As was stated in The Queen v. Green, 20132NWTSC 20, at paragraph 78:3There is nothing automatic aboutenhanced credit.The onus is on4the person being sentenced to showon a balance of probabilities that5the circumstances do justifyenhanced credit being granted.67This can be done in a variety of ways -8through viva voce evidence or, as was done in9this way, counsel for Mr. Paulette, who is an10Officer of the Court, having spoken with11somebody who is familiar and reliable with12respect to the circumstances of the offender's13pre-trial custody.14So in this case, counsel for Mr. Paulette15spoke with Richard Keppel who is a sentence16administrator with Corrections and familiar17with Mr. Paulette's circumstances so counsel18for Mr. Paulette is seeking enhanced credit19for his remand time.His basis for doing so20is that he would have earned remission for21most of the period he would have been a22serving prisoner, if he had been a serving23prisoner, and that he was not able to take24programs for a couple of reasons; one, he was25the lowest priority as he was a remand26prisoner and not a serving prisoner, so he has27the lowest priority for programs; and thatOfficial Court Reporters261there were no programs that were offered while2he was in remand that were appropriate for his3situation, although he did attend AA which I4understand is available to all persons who are5in custody.6With respect to remission, as was noted in7The Queen v. Manilaq, 2012 NWTSC 48 (CanLII):8Where there is credibleinformation that is presented to9the Court that a prisoner onremand would have earned remission10if they had been a servingprisoner, that is a relevant11consideration in deciding whethercredit for remand time should be12calculated on an enhanced basis.13I imagine there are a variety of other14circumstances that could justify enhanced15credit being given for remand time.And it16could even be that when a person has behaved17very well on remand time, the Court may decide18not to grant credit on an enhanced basis.In19my view, the exercise of discretion in the20area has to be based on the specific21circumstances of each case and not by applying22an automatic approach.23In this case, I am told that Mr. Paulette24was involved in a couple of minor incidents25while in remand such that if he were a serving26prisoner, he would have lost approximately27five days remission.In the circumstances, IOfficial Court Reporters271am not satisfied that Mr. Paulette should earn2enhanced credit for his remand time.I am3going to adjust his pre-sentence credit4slightly in order to simplify the calculations5of Mr. Paulette's sentence.6Please stand, Mr. Paulette.7Taking into account the circumstances,8your aboriginal background and the applicable9sentencing principles, I am satisfied that an10appropriate sentence for the sexual assault11causing bodily harm is five years12incarceration.You will be given credit for13the 126 days pre-sentence custody, which I14will round up to five months for simplicity,15leaving a sentence of four years and seven16months to be served.17You may sit down.18I will recommend that you be given19consideration to take any sexual offender20treatment and substance abuse treatment21programs that are suitable as soon as it is22possible.23As well, pursuant to Section 743.21,24there will be an order prohibiting you from25contacting the complainant directly or26indirectly while you are in custody.27With respect to the ancillary orders,Official Court Reporters281there will be a firearm prohibition order2pursuant to Section 109 of the Criminal Code.3It will begin today and end ten years after4your release from prison.5Having heard the submissions of counsel6yesterday, and I heard the request today with7respect to a Section 113 exemption, I am8satisfied in the circumstances that a9Section 113 exemption should be granted so10that you can apply to the chief firearms11officer or the registrar for a license or12registration certificate subject to any13conditions that they may impose.14The sexual assault causing bodily harm is15a primary designated offence and there will be16a DNA order.17There will also be an order pursuant to18the Sexual Offender Information Registration19Act.And as you have previously been subject20to a SOIRA order for the conviction in 2010,21the duration of the order will be for life.22Mr. Paulette, I hope that you will take23the opportunity offered by this sentence to24try and address some of your problems.It25seems clear to me, and I think that you26recognize as well based on what your lawyer27said yesterday and what you said, that youOfficial Court Reporters291need help and so I hope that you will follow2up on that because at this point, it is really3up to you.The corrections system can offer4you all of the programs they want but unless5you are willing to commit and take them and6really make an effort, then that's when we7will know whether there is going to be8success.9If you want to be there for your children,10to be a better father for your children than11your father was to you, then I think you need12to do something about that and it's not too13late to change and become a positive role14model for your children.15Counsel, neither counsel made any16submissions with respect to the victim of17crime surcharge.18MR. HANSEN:I would ask that it be19waived in the circumstances.The offence20occurred before the recent amendments and it21would be a hardship given that he will be22incarcerated for some time.I understand it23is a, relatively speaking, small amount of24money but for a person of Mr. Paulette's25means, it is a larger amount than would occur26to any of us who are gainfully employed during27that time.Official Court Reporters301THE COURT:Thank you.Ms. Lakusta.2MS. LAKUSTA:No opposition to that, Your3Honour.4THE COURT:I agree that as this offence5occurred prior to the changes, which make it6mandatory, that it is still open to me to7waive the victim of crime surcharge because of8hardship and given the sentence that has been9imposed and having heard about Mr. Paulette's10circumstances, I am satisfied that it should11be waived as a result of hardship.12All right, counsel, is there anything13else?14MS. LAKUSTA:Not from the Crown.15THE COURT:I want to thank you,16counsel, for your work on this trial and your17submissions.18MR.

C.J.S.C.:T.J.M., a young person age 17, to whom the Young\nOffenders Act R.S.C. 1985 c.Y‑1 applies, appeared in Dartmouth Court\non November 29, 1994, for offences alleged to have occurred in Dartmouth\nNovember 16 to 19, 1994. He was already in custody, was arraigned and bail was\ndenied. He was to enter pleas on December 1, 1994. While being transported\nthrough Bedford on the afternoon of December 1, he escaped from a Sheriff and\njumped a guard rail into the Sackville River. He was wearing leg shackles and\ntried to swim across the river. The Deputy followed him into the water and took\nhim back into custody. On December 8, an information was laid charging him with\nescaping lawful custody and wilfully failing to comply with a Probation Order\ndated June 15, 1994.On December 15, he entered pleas on the Dartmouth\noffences and the trial date was set for December 19. On that day he was\nconvicted of a number of offences and sentenced to a total of 12 months secure\ncustody and 6 months probation with conditions. (Some sentences were\nconsecutive and others concurrent.)On December 21 he plead guilty to the escape charge\nand the breach of probation charge was withdrawn. The Learned Trial Judge held\nhe should impose a one month consecutive sentence to discourage this type of\noffence. He recognized T.J.M. would not receive any time off the 12 month\nsentence already imposed.The defence appeals from the consecutive sentence.\nThe grounds of appeal are:(1) That the Order making the disposition\nconsecutive to the sentence being served by the Appellant at the time, is\nerroneous in law; and(2) The Order exceeded the jurisdiction of a\nProvincial Court Judge.Because in this appeal the chronological order of\nthe relevant events is crucial, they are set out as follows:\"November 16‑19, 1994Commission\nof Dartmouth offences.November 29, 1994Information\nlaid on Dartmouth offences. In custody on Dartmouth offences. Arraignment. Bail\ndenial.

Conviction and\nDisposition on Escape offence. Sentenced to 1 month custody, consecutive to\nDartmouth dispositions.January 19, 1994Notice\nof Appeal of Bedford disposition filed.\" (p. 3 Appellant's factum)Does a Youth Court Judge have the authority to order\na disposition concerning a Young Offender be served consecutively to\ndispositions the Young Offender is then under, even though at the time of the\noffence, the Young Offender was not under such dispositions? The answer is no.There is no general or inherent power in a Court to\nimpose consecutive sentences. Such power must be found in a federal enactment (R.\nv. C. (W.J.) (1988), 42 C.C.C. (3d) 253 at 256 quoting from Paul v The\nQueen (1982), 1982 CanLII 179 (SCC), 67 C.C.C. (2d) 97 (C.C.)).Section 20 of the Young Offenders Act deals\nwith the power to impose consecutive sentences on Young Offenders and states:\"(4.1)Where a disposition is\nmade under this section in respect of an offence committed by a young person\nafter the commencement of, but before the completion of, any dispositions made\nin respect of previous offences committed by the young person,(b)the disposition\nmay be served consecutively to the dispositions made in respect of the previous\noffences,\"This has been interpreted to mean a judge acts\nwithout jurisdiction when the judge imposes a consecutive disposition on a\nyoung offender not actually under a prior disposition at the time of commission\nof the offence for which the young offender is being sentenced (see R. v.\nC.(W.J.); R. v. J.M.C. (1990), 1990 CanLII 5424 (NS CA), 96 N.S.R. (2d) 179; R. v. M.A.S. (1991),\n1991 CanLII 4567 (NS CA), 102 N.S.R. (2d) 177; R. v. R.J.F. (1994), 1994 CanLII 7611 (NS CA), 132 N.S.R. (2d) 82 (C.A.; and T.M\nv. R. (N.S.C.A. Oct. 4, 1994 C.A.C. No. 108947 unreported). In the present\ncase, T.J.M. was charged, but not under any disposition on December 1 when he\ncommitted the offence of escaping lawful custody. He was in custody for the\nDartmouth charges but had not yet entered pleas or been sentenced. He was not\nsentenced for escaping lawful custodyuntil December 21.There has been an error in law and the Learned Trial\nJudge exceeded his jurisdiction by ordering a consecutive sentence. It happened\nbecause the significance of the sentencing order of the events in the Dartmouth\nand Bedford Courts was not brought to the attention of the Honourable Judge\nStroud before he imposed the one month consecutive sentence.The Appeal is allowed and an order will issue\ndirecting the disposition of one month consecutive to the twelve months shall\nbe changed to one month concurrent to time being served.Constance\nR.

Gillette for Her\nMajesty the Queen.Mr. R. Regular for Ms.\nDenney.DECISION OF GORMAN,\nP.C. J.(SENTENCE)INTRODUCTION:[1]Ms. Denney was convicted of the offences of dangerous driving and failing\nto stop/evading the police, contrary to sections 249(1)(a) and 249.1(1) of the Criminal\nCode of Canada, RSC 1985 (the Criminal Code).The Crown\nproceeded by way of summary conviction in relation to both counts and the\nmatter was adjourned for the imposition of sentence.The primary issue for\nconsideration is whether or not this is an appropriate case for the Court to\ngrant Ms. Denney a “discharge.”[2]For the reasons that will follow herein, I have\nconcluded that this is not an appropriate case to do so.Let me explain my\nreasons for this conclusion by commencing with a review of the circumstances of\nthe two offences committed by Ms. Denney.THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED AT THE TRIAL[3]The evidence presented at the trial established that on February\n4, 2006, Ms. Denney’s husband informed her that he was having an affair with\nanother woman (Ms. Rice).Ms. Denney became very upset.She testified that\nshe ran out of her house, without any footwear on, and drove toward Ms. Rice’s\nresidence in Deer Lake.She conceded that she did so in order to “confront” Ms. Rice.[4]After a confrontation occurred at Mrs. Rice’s\nresidence, the police were contacted.The police located Ms. Denney driving her\nmotor vehicle on the highway.After they engaged their emergency equipment,\nMs. Denney pulled her vehicle over to the side of the road.As the officers\nwere speaking to Ms. Denney, one of them (Constable Hyde) noticed that Ms.\nDenney was reaching for the gear shift of her vehicle.He banged on the\ndriver’s side window several times and yelled to Ms. Denney not to move the\nvehicle.[5]Ms. Denney ignored the officer and moved her\nvehicle back onto the highway.While doing so, she almost ran over Constable\nHyde’s foot.He estimated that he was within two feet of Ms. Denney’s vehicle\nwhen she pulled it back on to the highway from its parked position.The other\nofficer (Constable Letto) had to “jump back” as a result of the manner in which\nMs. Denney pulled on to the highway.[6]After Ms. Denney pulled on to the highway, the\ntwo officers ran back to their vehicle and began to pursue her.Their emergency\nequipment was engaged.As the officers were pursuing Ms. Denney, they received\na call from another officer indicating that there were concerns that Ms. Denney\nwas suicidal and might purposely drive off of the road if they continued their\npursuit.As a result, the officers turned off their emergency equipment and\nterminated the pursuit.Both officers testified that Ms. Denney did not stop.They both indicated that they had pursued Ms. Denney for a brief period of time\nbefore stopping.Constable Letto estimated their pursuit to have lasted\napproximately fifteen seconds.[7]Ms. Denney conceded that she was aware that the\npolice vehicle was behind her and that it had its emergency equipment engaged.She agreed that she failed to stop.She testified at the trial that she failed\nto do so because she “wanted to go home.”[8]In my reasons for convicting Ms. Denney of the\noffence of dangerous driving, I wrote ([2007] N.J. No. 181, at paragraphs 58\nand 59):I\nam satisfied that the Crown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Ms.\nDenney pulled on to the highway from where she had stopped without checking to\ndetermine if there were any vehicles coming behind her and without checking to\ndetermine where Constable Hyde was standing.I am also satisfied that she\ncontinued to pull on to the highway even though Constable Hyde was banging on\nher vehicle’s window.Her evidence that she thought Constable Hyde was going\nto hit her, is an illustration of how unreliable Ms. Denney’s evidence is.This was a fanciful description of her state of mind at the time.I\nam satisfied that driving from a parked position onto a two lane highway\nwithout checking to see if any other vehicle is proceeding on the highway\nbehind you, while two police officers are standing in extremely close proximity\nto your vehicle and one of them is banging on your vehicle’s window to stop,\nconstitutes a marked departure from the standard of care that a reasonable\nperson would observe.A reasonable person would not have endangered the safety\nof two police officers that were in such a position nor pulled on to the\nhighway in the manner that Ms. Denney did.I accept that Ms. Denney was very\nupset.This is what caused her to act in such a dangerous manner.Her\nevidence, for instance, that she drove away from the police officers because\nshe wanted to go home, illustrates her lack of attention to her actual\nsituation on February 4, 2006, and the potential consequences of operating her\nvehicle in the manner in which she did.A reasonable person in Ms. Denney’s\nsituation on February 4, 2006, would also have been very upset.However, a\nreasonable person would have gotten out of his or her vehicle when requested by\nthe police to do so and would never have operated a motor vehicle in the manner\nwhich Ms. Denney did.[9]In convicting Ms. Denney of the offence of\nevading the police, I concluded as follows (at paragraph 67):The\nevidence establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that Ms. Denney was aware, after\nshe drove back onto the highway, that a police vehicle was pursuing her with\nits emergency equipment engaged.The evidence also establishes that despite\nthis knowledge she failed to stop.Though the police vehicle was behind Ms.\nDenney for a maximum of fifteen seconds, Ms. Denney’s had a reasonable and\npracticable period of time in which to stop, but failed to do so.I am\nsatisfied that she failed to do so because she wanted to evade being\napprehended.Thus, the Crown has proven both the actus reus and mens\nrea elements of the offence.Ms. Denney testified that she failed to stop\nbecause she wanted to go home.This does not constitute a reasonable excuse\nfor failing to stop.THE CRIMINAL CODE’S SENTENCING\nPROVISIONS[10]Section 718\nof the Criminal Code states that the fundamental purpose of\nsentencing “is to contribute…to respect for the law and the maintenance of a\njust, peaceful, and safe society.”This is to be achieved by imposing\nsentences which have, among others, the following objectives:- separating\noffenders from society, where necessary;- denouncing\nunlawful conduct;- general\ndeterrence;-\nrehabilitation; and- the promoting of a “sense of\nresponsibility in offenders, andacknowledgement\nof the harm done to victims and the community.”[11]Section\n718.2(d) states that “an offender should not be deprived of liberty, if less\nrestrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances” and section\n718.2(e) states that “all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are\nreasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders, with\nparticular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.”[12]Section 718.1 of the Criminal\nCode states that any sentence imposed must be “proportionate to the\ngravity of the offence and the degree ofresponsibility of the offender.”[13]In this particular case, the Crown did not seek\nto have a period of imprisonment imposed upon Ms. Denney, and considering the\ncircumstances of what occurred, this was an appropriate approach for Crown\ncounsel to take.Ms. Denney’s actions appear to have arisen as a result of the\nspecific circumstances of February 4, 2006.They can be fairly described as\nuncharacteristic of her and seen as an isolated reaction which is unlikely to\nbe repeated.However, it must also be noted that her actions were very dangerous.She came very close to injuring a police officer and this must always be seen\nas a significant aggravating factor in sentencing.As recently pointed out by\nthe Nova Scotia Court of Appeal in R. v. Marsman, 2007\nNSCA 65 (CanLII), “Police officers, day in and day out, serve and protect our\ncommunities from harm.When they are attacked, in many ways, we are all\nvictimized.”Thus, for the type of offences committed by Ms. Denney in this\ncase, the Court must stress the sentencing principles of general deterrence and\ndenunciation.Any sentence imposed must attempt to discourage members of the\npublic from driving in a dangerous manner and encourage them to cooperate with\nthe police when stopped by them and to refrain from attempting to evade the\npolice so as to prevent the type of harm and injury which can result from\npolice pursuits (see R. v. A.J.P.S. (2006), 35 M.V.R. (5th) 247\n(B.C.P.C.) and R. v. Roberts (2004), 2005 ABCA 11 (CanLII), 192 C.C.C. (3d) 462\n(Alta. C.A.)).Having said this, in R. v. Angelillo (2006), 2006 SCC 55 (CanLII), 214 C.C.C. (3d) 309, the Supreme Court of\nCanada indicated that “sentencing\nis an individualized process in which the court must take into account not only\nthe circumstances of the offence, but also the specific circumstances of the\noffender.”[14]In this particular case, the Court\nwas provided with very little information concerning Ms. Denney’s background or\npresent circumstances.The Court was advised by counsel that she is thirty-nine\nyears of age and is presently employed on a full time basis.Both parties\nagreed that she does not have a criminal record.No evidence was presented\nwhich would establish what impact, if any, the entering of a conviction would specifically\nhave upon Ms. Denney.THE\nCRIMINAL CODE’S DISCHARGE PROVISION[15]The Court’s\nauthority to grant an offender a discharge is found in section 730(1) of the Criminal\nCode:Where\nan accused, other than an organization, pleads guilty to or is found guilty of\nan offence, other than an offence for which a minimum punishment is prescribed\nby law or an offence punishable by imprisonment for fourteen years or for life,\nthe court before which the accused appears may, if it considers it to be in the\nbest interests of the accused and not contrary to the public interest, instead\nof convicting the accused, by order direct that the accused be discharged\nabsolutely or on the conditions prescribed in a probation order made under\nsubsection 731(2).[16]As can be seen, this provision allows the Court to\nrefrain from entering a conviction, despite proof that an offence has been\ncommitted, if satisfied two prerequisites exist.The Court must be satisfied\nthat a discharge is:1.in\nthe best interests of the offender; and2.not\ncontrary to the public interest.[17]In R. v. Elsharawy (1997), 1997 CanLII 14708 (NL CA), 119\nC.C.C. (3d) 565 (N.L.C.A.), the Court of Appeal considered these two\nprerequisites and stated:For the Court to\nexercise its discretion to grant a discharge under s. 730 of the Criminal\nCode, the Court must consider that that type of disposition is: (i) in the\nbest interests of the accused: and (ii) not contrary to the public\ninterest.The first condition presupposes that the accused is a\nperson of good character, usually without previous conviction or discharge,\nthat he does not require personal deterrence or rehabilitation and that a\ncriminal conviction may have significant adverse repercussions.The\nsecond condition involves a consideration of the principle of general\ndeterrence with attention being paid to the gravity of the offence, its\nincidence in the community, public attitudes towards it and public confidence\nin the effective enforcement of the criminal law.See R. v.\nFallofield (1973), 13 C.C.C. (2d) 450\n(BCCA) and R. v. Waters (1990), 1990 CanLII 7561 (SK QB), 54 C.C.C. (3d) 40\n(Sask.QB).[18]In R. v. O’Keefe, [2006] N.J. No. 290, I\nhad the opportunity to consider Elsharawy\nand the principles applicable to determining when a discharge should be granted.At paragraphs 25 and 26, I suggested that a generous approach should be adopted:Beyond the\nstatutory prerequisites set out in the section itself, there are no offences\nwhich are immune from the application of section 730(1).However, a discharge\nwill not usually be imposed for a serious offence or upon an offender with a\ncriminal record (see R. v. D.P., [2004] N.J. No. 38 (P.C.)).However,\nthis is not an absolute rule.Discharges have been granted to offenders with\nprevious convictions (see for instance, R. v. L.H.B, 2006 NLTD 87 (CanLII), [2006] N.J. No. 149\n(S.C.)) and for relatively serious offences (see for instance, Burke and\nMorgan).In some cases, the nature of the offence will be such that the\nprinciples of sentencing set out in the Criminal Code would be offended\nby the granting of a discharge, particularly the sentencing principle of\ngeneral deterrence (see R. v. Roberts (2004), 2004 SKCA 153 (CanLII), 190 C.C.C. (3d) 504 (Sask.\nC.A.)).Thus, in R. v. Smith, [2005] N.J. No.\n102 (P.C.), Judge Porter, at paragraph 18, declined to\ngrant the offender a discharge because he concluded that the “principles\nof sentencing, including denunciation, general and specific deterrence, and the\nprotection of society would not be achieved by granting the Accused a\ndischarge.It is not in the public interest to do so, and the request for a\ndischarge is accordingly denied” (also see R. v. Watson (1999), 1998 CanLII 13310 (NL SCTD), 168 Nfld.\n\u0026 P.E.I.R. 172 (N.L.C.A.), R. v. Styles (2000), 2000 CanLII 28803 (NL SCTD), 189 Nfld. \u0026\nP.E.I.R. 116 (N.L.S.C.), at paragraph 44, R. v. Fitzpatrick (2005), 2005 NLTD 76 (CanLII), 248\nNfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 104 (S.C.), at paragraphs 55 to 57 and R. v. Collier,\n2006 NBCA 92 (CanLII), [2006] N.B.J. No. 371 (C.A.)).Having said this, for minor offences committed by first time\noffenders, a generous approach to the application of section 730(1) of the Criminal\nCode is desirable.In those cases, a discharge will be entirely consistent\nwith the principles of sentencing set out in the Criminal Code and\ndrawing a distinction between a discharge and a suspended sentence will serve\nno practical or academic purpose.If a court is debating between these two\nsanctions in such a case, then it should feel comfortable in granting a\nconditional discharge.SENTENCING PRECEDENTS[19]In R. v. Penney and Bennett (2001), 2001 CanLII 5245 (NL PC), 208 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 126\n(N.L.P.C.), the two accused pled guilty to a number of offences.One of the\noffences to which Mr. Penney entered a plea of guilty was the offence of dangerous\ndriving.I described the circumstances of that offence as follows:At\n6:50 p.m. on November 19th, 2001, an officer of the Royal Newfoundland\nConstabulary attempted to stop a motor vehicle for speeding.When\nthe police officer activated the emergency lights the vehicle accelerated and\nthe officer gave chase.Eventually the vehicle struck a guard rail\nwhen attempting to navigate a turn.Mr. Bennett got out of the\npassenger door and ran into the woods.He would be subsequently\narrested, later that evening, at the Western Memorial Regional Hospital, in Corner Brook,\nby correctional officers who were there guarding Mr. Penney.Mr.\nPenny, the driver of the vehicle, got out of the vehicle, after the accident,\nand jumped over the guard rail.Apparently he did not realize that\nthe drop was approximately thirty feet.Mr. Penney had recently\nmoved to Corner Brook from Ontario.His counsel described Mr. Penney's\ninjuries as \"significant.\"[20]For the dangerous driving offence, I imposed a\nperiod of two months incarceration and a twelve month driving prohibition.[21]In R. v. Hardy, 2005 CanLII 7643 (NL PC), [2005] N.J. No. 92\n(P.C.), the accused pled guilty to having failed to stop as directed by a\npolice officer.The trial judgesummarized\nthe circumstances of what occurred as follows:Monday\nnight, March 21, 2005, at around six p.m., the Accused was seen driving a blue\nChevrolet pickup truck in Marystown. The truck had tinted windows, and so\nConstable Bradbury activated the lights and siren of his marked police car and\nstopped the pickup. The Accused identified himself by means of an Alberta\ndriver’s licence. He was issued a summary offence information for the tinted\nwindows, and the police officer noted some other defects with the vehicle,\nincluding excessive glare from the lights and a defective parking brake.While\nthe police officer was getting back into the police car with the documents\nprovided for the vehicle by the Accused, the latter said \"you fucking\nidiot, I’m not staying here\", put the truck in gear and left the scene.The\nAccused did not get very far before the constable stopped him again,\napproximately two hundred meters away, in the vicinity of the apartment\nbuilding where the Accused’s parents live.[22]The trial judge concluded that the imposition of\na suspended sentence was appropriate.[23]In R. v. Fry (2005), 2005 NLTD 190 (CanLII), 252 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 59\n(N.L.S.C.), the accused was convicted of the offences of impaired driving and\ndangerous driving.He had driven his father's pickup truck into a residence\ncausing serious property damage to the residence and his father's vehicle.He had\na previous criminal record which was alcohol-related.For the dangerous\ndriving offence, the trial judge imposed a period of twelve months imprisonment\nto be served on a conditional basis.[24]In R. v. MacDonald, [2007] N.J. No. 115\n(S.C.), the accused pled guilty to a number of offences, including evading the\npolice.The trial judge described the circumstances of the offences committed\nby Mr. MacDonald, including the section 249.1(1) offence, as follows:During the early\nmorning of August 15th, Mr. MacDonald was at the home of Ms. King at which time\nhe had blocked off her vehicle. There was an incident at that stage. Subsequent\nto this happening, the actions involving the offences that I just described\nactually took place. The facts disclose that Mr. MacDonald, after calling the\nresidence of Ansel King looking for Ms. King, actually went into the residence\nwith a loaded firearm. He then grabbed Ms. King by the neck. He ordered Mr.\nKing to be seated and Mr. Guinchard to sit on the floor. The firearm was\npointed at them. Mr. MacDonald was not shy about displaying the fact that the\ngun was loaded and he did so by ejecting a shell and then reloading the\nfirearm.He eventually left\nthe residence after some discussion took place. Ms. King acted in a manner\nwhich attempted to diffuse the situation, suggesting they go to the airport to\npick up a relative. She attempted to have him leave the firearm behind but he\nwould not do so. The police went looking for Mr. MacDonald and Ms. King,\neventually followed him, and then had to box him in with police cars in order\nto have him stop his vehicle.[25]The trial judge imposed a period of thirty-three\nmonths imprisonment, including three months for the section 249.1(1) offence.ANALYSIS[26]In considering whether or not to impose a discharge, I begin with the\nobservation that Ms. Denney’s offences cannot be fairly characterized as minor\nones.She purposely placed two police officers at risk of harm.In addition,\nthough Ms. Denney has no previous convictions and the sentencing principle of specific\ndeterrence is not required to be emphasized, no evidence was placed before the\nCourt to establish that a criminal conviction would or might cause significant\nadverse repercussions for her.Though I would hesitate to conclude that the\npresentation of such evidence is a mandatory requirement for a discharge to be\ngranted, it does make it difficult for the Court to conclude that a discharge\nis in Ms. Denney’s best interests, beyond it being in the interest of every\noffender.In addition, as pointed out earlier, this case requires a\nconcentration on the sentencing principles of general deterrence and\ndenunciation.These sentencing principles cannot be satisfied in this case by\nthe imposition of a discharge because of the seriousness of Ms. Denney’s\nactions and the potential harm she subjected two police officers to.Thus, I\nconclude that the imposition of a discharge in this case would be contrary to\nthe public interest and therefore I decline to impose such a sentence.What\nthen is an appropriate sentence?[27]As indicated earlier, the imposition of a period\nof imprisonment is not in issue.Placing Ms. Denney on probation is not\nrequired or useful and I am not satisfied that a driving prohibition is\nrequired.I have concluded that the principles of sentencing set out in the Criminal\nCode can be satisfied in thiscase through the imposition of the following fines:1.for the dangerous\ndriving offence, a fine of $1,000.00;2.for the offence\nof evading the police, a fine of $250.00; and3.for each offence,\nthe imposition of a victim fine surcharge of $100.00.[28]Pursuant to section 734.1 of the Criminal\nCode, the fines imposed must be paid to the Provincial Court of\nNewfoundland and Labrador at a minimum rate of $300.00 per\nmonth, with the first payment being made on July 31, 2007 and the subsequent\npayments being made each month thereafter until paid in full.The victim fine\nsurcharges imposed must be paid to the Provincial Court of Newfoundland and\nLabrador within thirty days of the date of this sentencing judgement.[1][29]Judgement accordingly.[1]\nThe Court was not provided with any information as regards Ms. Denney’s level\nof income.Thus, the monthly payments have been set in the absence of the type\nof evidence which should be presented at a sentence hearing.However, this is\nnot a cause for concern as Ms. Denney can apply to the Court for a variation of\nthe section 734.1 order, if the amount set out as a monthly payment proves\nonerous."}

Van Dongen- and -)forthe Respondent))Appealheard:GENE MICHAEL DUMASSOLDAT)November1, 2011)(Accused) Respondent)Judgmentdelivered:)May 3, 2012MONNIN J.A.1The Crown\nappeals from a conditional sentence of two years less a day imposed after a\nguilty plea to one count of possession of goods valued in excess of $5,000\nobtained by crime, in this case a truck.Background2A discussion\nof this particular accused’s background leading up to the sentence imposed by\nthe Provincial Court is important to appreciate the arguments of the Crown and\ndefence.3Although\nonly 23 years old at the time of sentencing, to say that the accused has an\nextensive criminal record is an understatement.At the time of the offence, he\nhad been on parole for a few months after serving a five-year sentence for\nvarious theft and driving offences.This conviction, to which he pleaded\nguilty, was his 77th motor vehicle related conviction since 2002.4On March 10,\n2010, he was released on parole after serving part of a five-year sentence for\nmotor vehicle related offences.On a previous appeal, this court had this to\nsay about this particular accused:The sentencing judge\ntook these mitigating factors into account.We acknowledge that this sentence\nis a heavy one for a youthful offender serving his first adult sentence.However, this is a unique situation.From the age of 12 to 17, this offender\naccumulated 81 prior convictions, 69 of which related to motor vehicles.He\nhas had virtually every type of disposition available under the Youth\nCriminal Justice Act, S.C. 2002, c. 1, including five periods of supervised\nprobation.His pre-sentence report confirms, unfortunately, that his entire\nidentity revolves around the theft of motor vehicles, which brings him status\nand recognition among his fellow gang members.His attempts to evade capture\nhave led to several dangerous police chases and the offences in question were\ncommitted when he was at large as a sentenced prisoner for related offences.His behaviour is unacceptable and dangerous.Despite the accused’s youth, the\nsentence imposed must still be proportionate to the gravity of the offences\ncommitted.5The facts\nconcerning this particular appeal are that between July 4 and 5, 2010, the\naccused came into possession of a stolen truck.On July 8, 2010, he drove that\nvehicle to a local supermarket.The police came upon the stolen vehicle.When\nthe accused exited the store, he saw the police and left the area.He was\narrested approximately one week later.The matter was scheduled for court on\nDecember 20, 2010, but, as several witnesses did not attend, the trial was\nadjourned.Originally charged for stealing the motor vehicle and other\noffences, he pled guilty to the lesser count of possessing goods obtained by\ncrime and the other charges were stayed.At the sentencing hearing on April\n27, 2011, the Crown sought a sentence of two years while the accused proposed a\nsentence of time in custody (roughly two and one-half months) and probation.At the end of the sentencing submissions of both counsel, the sentencing judge\non his own raised the possibility of a conditional sentence.He appeared to be\nseeking input from the accused’s counsel as to whether the accused would abide\nby the strict conditions of that type of sentence.He stated:And so that rather than,\nthan doing it automatically off the top I offer to individuals the, the\navoidance of going to jail or the fact of just spending whatever the set time\nwould be and not having conditions that they have to meet from now for the next\ntwo years.He advised counsel that it’s an option\nthat he is considering.Prophetically, he stated:.… I am concerned with,\nwith his record, that we are looking at if it’s an automatic breach within a\nmatter of a month or two, then he’s coming back and he’s looking at two years\nin jail ….6After\nobtaining a response from the accused’s counsel that he would prefer a\nconditional sentence, the sentencing judge then proceeded to impose one.7Just over a\nmonth later, the accused breached his conditional sentence by being away from\nhis home outside the terms of his curfew.He was sighted by police and\nfollowed back to his home approximately 40 minutes beyond the time that he was\nsupposed to have returned.He was brought back before the sentencing judge who\nhad imposed the conditional sentence on a breach of the conditional sentence.The sentencing judge declined to terminate the conditional sentence, but\ninstead suspended it for eight months.Standard\nof Review8There is no\ndispute as to the standard of review on this sentence appeal.Deference must\nbe shown to the sentencing judge’s decision.Absent an error in principle or\nfailure to consider a relevant sentencing principle, we should only intervene\nif the sentence is demonstrably unfit.See R. v. M. (C.A.), 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] 1\nS.C.R. 500 at para. 90; and R. v. Ruizfuentes (H.S.), 2010 MBCA 90 (CanLII) at\npara. 7, 258 Man.R. (2d) 220.Crown’s\nPosition9The Crown\nargues that the sentencing judge reached his conclusion with respect to the\nimposition of a conditional sentence in error.It argues that he commenced\nfrom a starting point that he wished to impose a sentence of 12 months’\nimprisonment, but offered the accused the option of a conditional sentence in which\ncase the sentence would be increased to two years less a day.In addition, he\nfailed to perform an assessment of the risk posed by the accused if permitted\nto serve the sentence in the community, which is a requirement for the\nimposition of any conditional sentence.In its submission, the accused, with\nhis lengthy list of criminal convictions, is not a suitable candidate for a\nconditional sentence.Accordingly, it argues that the sentencing judge\nproceeded in a fashion that amounted to an error in principle and led to a\nsentence that was unfit.Accused’s\nPosition10The accused’s argument is that the sentencing judge was\nentitled to consider the option of a conditional sentence as opposed to a term\nof imprisonment of 12 months, which he had articulated.He argues that the\nsentencing judge’s inquiries of defence counsel were only to ascertain the\naccused’s willingness and ability to comply with a conditional sentence if\nimposed.It was not a delegation of that decision to the accused as argued by\nthe Crown.11As to the\nposition of the Crown that no risk assessment was undertaken, the defence\npoints to this court’s decision in R. v. Allison (D.C.), 2005 MBCA 141 (CanLII),\n201 Man.R. (2d) 109, to the effect that a sentencing judge is not presumed to\nignore facts simply because they are not mentioned in the reasons.As well, in\nR. v. Olotu (T.A.), 2004 MBCA 146 (CanLII), 187 Man.R. (2d) 232, the court found\nan assessment of the risk by looking at the submissions of counsel along with\nthe questions of the court.In this case, counsel argues that comments by the\nsentencing judge and his questions of defence counsel indicate that the\nassessment was performed by the sentencing judge, although not explicitly\nreferred to by him in his reasons.AnalysisLaw on Conditional Sentences12In R. v.\nProulx, 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61, the court discussed the\nrequirements of s. 742.1 of the Criminal Code governing the\nimposition of conditional sentences.In that case, the court reviewed s. 742.1\nand set out the four criteria that must be considered before deciding to impose\na conditional sentence, namely (at para. 46):(1) the offender must be convicted of an\noffence that is not punishable by a minimum term of imprisonment;(2) the court must impose a term of\nimprisonment of less than two years;(3) the safety of the community would\nnot be endangered by the offender serving the sentence in the community;\nand(4) a conditional sentence would be\nconsistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out in\nss. 718 to 718.2.[emphasis added]13The\nimportance of the third criterion, an assessment of the risk, was considered by\nthis court in R. v. Eckert (J.J), 2006 MBCA 6 (CanLII), 201 Man.R. (2d) 175,\nwhere Steel J.A., speaking for the court, stated (at para. 6):Before imposing a conditional sentence, the\njudge must weigh the risk of the offender re-offending and the gravity of the\nharm that might result. He must decide that the accused poses an acceptable\nrisk to the community which can be managed by the imposition of appropriate\nconditions.14I agree with\nthe Crown’s position that there was no proper risk assessment.A proper\nassessment would have led to the conclusion that this individual was at great\nrisk to reoffend if living in the community.I also agree with the Crown that\nthis accused is not an appropriate candidate for a conditional sentence,\nespecially when he was convicted of a crime occurring while he was on parole\nand which is of a similar nature to that for which he was last sentenced to\nfive years in jail.I recognize that there is no evidence that he stole this\ntruck or engaged in joyriding, as was the case in previous offences.Nevertheless, he was found in possession of a stolen vehicle, an offence\nsimilar to that for which he had been arrested numerous times.15Given that\nthe sentencing judge was in error in failing to perform an appropriate risk\nassessment, deference is not owed to the sentence that he has imposed.I am of\nthe view that, given the accused’s past record and the circumstances\nsurrounding this offence, at the sentencing on April 27, 2011, a fit and proper\nsentence at that date would have been a sentence of 18 months of incarceration,\nwith credit for pre-sentence custody of two and a half months, leaving a\nfurther term of\nincarceration of 15 and\na half months.16Since the\naccused had served two months of his conditional sentence prior to the\nconditional sentence being\nsuspended on June 22, 2011\nfor a period of eight months, and two months since that time, he should be\ngiven a credit of 12 months.This would leave him a further three and a half\nmonths to serve as of April 27, 2012.17This\ndecision was not released until May 3, 2012, due to illness of counsel.As a\nresult, the accused continued to serve his conditional sentence and should be\ngiven credit for that extra week.18For these\nreasons, I would grant leave to appeal the sentence and allow the appeal.J.A.I agree:J.A.I agree:J.A."}

The\namount of compensation and the role of the victim in the process were. These\nreasons address:•the\nscope of restitution•whether\na victim can make sentencing submissions[2]Background\nFacts: Darren Bullen, 21, resides in Dawson and is a member of the First\nNation. He pled guilty to two break-and-enters to commercial properties, the\nDowntown Hotel and Klondike Kate's, and two process offences. The Downtown\nHotel claimed their loss amounted to $1,090. Klondike Kate's claimed losses\ntotalling $2,780.A\nco-accused involved only in the break-and-enter to Klondike Kate's, with a more\nsubstantial criminal record, was previously sentenced and required to pay\n$1,940 to Klondike Kate's.[3]A\njoint submission in this case called for a suspended sentence and 18 months\nprobation with numerous terms. The compensation proposed was limited to $1,240,\nconsisting of the remaining $840 to Klondike Kate's and only $400 to the\nDowntown Hotel. The owners of both businesses filed victim impact statements\nand attended the sentencing hearings.[4]The\njoint submission was based on several special circumstances:a)First Offence – Darren had no previous criminal record. Tragic to\nnote, but it is very rare that a young man growing up in a rural Yukon\ncommunity appears as an adult without a criminal record.b)Subsequent Conduct – After the offence, Darren pursued a constructive\nplan to change his deteriorating lifestyle. Of the 15 people who began a\nsubstance abuse program, he was one of the only three to successfully finish.\nHe was the youngest person to complete a demanding commercial art course. His\nmother testified that significant changes were evident in his attitude and\nbehaviour.c)References – Everyone — his instructors, counsellors, probation\nofficer, former employers, and a victim — acknowledged his formidable talents.d)Personal Circumstances – A gifted young man with the potential for a very\npromising future, several recent events had undermined his capacity to cope and\nto remain on a \"good path\". The death of his grandmother, an\nimportant support in his life, and fathering a child with a woman who did not\nwant to continue the relationship, dragged him into despair. He turned to\nalcohol and a bad crowd for solace.e)Restitution Payment – Prior to sentencing, he paid the full amount of\nrestitution called for by the joint submission ($1,240).f)Support of Community – His mother and the probation officer, and most who\nhave had recent direct contact with him, are supportive and believe he can\nabide by and benefit from probation. Sadly, First Nation support was missing.\nNo reason was offered. This young man, with enormous potential to be a future\nleader, needs the active support of family and community to realize the\ncontribution he is capable of making to his immediate and extended community.[5]These\nfactors warrant accepting the joint submission except for the proposed amount\nof restitution.[6]PART\nI – Scope of Restitution Orders:Both Crown and defence submitted that\nrestitution for property damage is restricted by s. 738(1)(a) to the actual\nvalue of damaged property. For example, the cost of a new window is covered,\nbut not the cost of labour to install it. The victim asked for much more. The\nlosses sought to be compensated by the Downtown Hotel, as set out in their\nclaim include:\"The\nfollowing is a tabulation in monetary terms of the costs incurred by our hotel\nrelative to the theft of the locked cash box containing the complete set of\nkeys for all of the secure doors and storage facilities of our saloon\noperation.·11 padlocks, with six of the 11\nhaving to be keyed alike(11 x $15)$165.00·One cash box modified with\nlockable hasp (1 x $50)50.00·Two doors re-keyed with return\nfreight to Whitehorse75.00·Two persons searching for the\nmissing keys, cutting offthe existing locks, purchasing new locks and cuttingduplicate copies (8 hrs. @ $50/hr.)400.00·One person viewing video\nsurveillance tape(4 hrs. @ $50/hr.)200.00·One person attending court,\nconsulting with the RCMP,preparing victim impact statements and other mattersrelative to the incident and resulting in the loss of\ntimefrom the regular management of the hotel (4 hrs. @\n$50/hr.)200.00The\ntotal of the foregoing costs is $1090. This is a conservative figure of our\nphysical losses and as stated in the victim impact statement submitted by my\nwife, there can be no reasonable figure put on the damage to our staff morale\nand our own emotional turmoil.Further\nto all of the foregoing, this incident happened early last October and we have\nhad to be involved and waited until six months later to bring some kind of\nclosure to this unwarranted intrusion in our business and personal lives. I do\nnot believe that our business and personal lives have been given any of the\nrights and privileges relative to those accorded the perpetrator's.We are\nrequesting, as stated in my wife's victim statement of Oct. 16/00, that the\nmaximum possible penalty be applied to this case and that we be compensated for\nour financial losses in total.\"[7]Both\ncounsel submitted that s. 738(1)(a) limits restitution to the costs of\nreplacement parts.[8]Limited\nScope of Criminal Process:Counsel did not suggest the victim cannot seek\nrestitution, but suggested that the best means to do so lies in a civil court.\nTo engage a victim as a witness to secure a conviction in the interest of the\nstate and then leave the victim to their own means to pursue their injuries in\nanother process, in another court, raises questions of fairness and\npracticality. In many respects, victims' interests have been unduly subrogated\nto state interests in the evolution of criminal courts from their beginnings in\ncivil courts.[9]There\nare limits to what a criminal court can do to compensate victims of crime.\nRecent changes in law and policy warrant re-examining these limitations. The\nfollowing changes are relevant:1.Criminal Code amendments to restitution2.Enactment of sentencing\nprinciples3.Impact of restorative justice[10]1.Criminal\nCode Changes – The 1995 amendments clarified that restitution\ncan be a stand-alone remedy enforceable in civil courts. An offender who\ndefaults onrestitution cannot be charged if restitution is not a part of\nprobation. Whatever amount is ordered as restitution by a criminal court does\nnot affect a subsequent civil action, except as a set-off. These amendments\nreduce many previous concerns arising from the use of criminal courts to\ncompensate victims.[11]2.Enactment\nof Sentencing Principles – The codification of the fundamental\nprinciples of sentencing includes three objectives that directly relate to\nrestitution.[12]Section\n718:(d)to\nassist in rehabilitating offenders;(e)to provide reparations for harm\ndone to victims or to the community; and(f)to promote a sense of\nresponsibility in offenders, and acknowledgement of the harm done to victims\nand to the community.[13]Paying\nfor damages enables an offender to take responsibility in a way that can\ndirectly promote forgiveness from the victim and engender an enhanced\nself-esteem for the offender. Both factors significantly contribute to\nrehabilitating offenders.You know, at first I didn't even think about paying\nback anything, eh … Not the first time I've done a B\u0026E and been to jail.\nBut when the circle came up with that idea, at first I still didn't think much\nof it. But after I did it — felt good about it — you know, good about doing it\n— and good for me. Now, with them [the victims] accepting my apology, like, who\ncould have ever believed that I'd get forgiven by them, eh? I feel like it's a\nnew start with them — and for myself. My family was proud I worked to pay them\nback — so was I, eh! (Offender after circle at Kwanlin Dun, 1993)[14]Long\nbefore the separation of the court into criminal and civil divisions, many of\nthe wrongful acts now deemed to be crimes were redressed solely by\ncompensation. Compensation has always been, as it is in this case, a primary concern\nfor victims who suffer damages. In all 50 American states, the courts are\nmandated by statute to order offenders to reimburse victims for financial\nlosses (M. Hook \u0026 A. Seymour, Offender Re-Entry, 5(3) Crime Victims\nReport 33). In the United States, restitution is widely recognized as \"one\nof the only ways that crime victims can hold offenders directlyresponsible\nfor the harm they have caused\" (Hook \u0026 Seymour, supra, at 43).\nIn compensating victims, offenders take direct responsibility for their action\nand openly acknowledge the harm they have caused.[15]3.Restorative\nJustice Principles – Parliament and the courts have acknowledged the\nimportance of restorative and community justice initiatives (R. v. Gladue,\n1999 CanLII 679 (SCC), [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688). Reconciliation and healing, both central objectives of\ncommunity justice, are advanced by restitution. Community justice practices\nrevive the importance of compensation and call for developing new ways to\ncompensate victims for the adverse impacts of crime. In R. v. Proulx,\n2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61, the court recognized restorative justice practices make\nimportant contributions in reducing our excessive reliance upon incarceration.[16]These\nchanges combine to make restitution more readily accessible by criminal courts\nand a more important tool in realizing the overriding principles and objectives\nof sentencing. Some courts have been resourceful in stretching the reach of\nrestitution to provide practical responses to the needs of victims. Offenders\nhave been asked to pay the counselling costs of victims of sexual offences (R.\nv. C.(A.) (1993), 142 N.B.R. (2d) 217 (C.A.)) and to pay the legal\nand auditing costs incurred by a victim of a complex theft (R. v. Arsenault\n(1994), 1994 CanLII 8800 (PE SCAD), 123 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 65 (P.E.I.C.A.)). In doing so, long before the\ncurrent popularity of restorative and community justice, the courts were\nengaged in restorative practices. Significant restitution orders that have a\nrealistic prospect of being paid can be an integral part of an overall\nsentencing plan that offsets some, if not all, of the need to rely on jail.[17]Limitations\nof Criminal Courts in Ordering Restitution:Too much has been made of the\ncriminal court's inability to deal with restitution. There are no significant\nlimitations in a criminal court process to preclude most claims for\nrestitution. At the federal level, the same judges do criminal and civil work.\nAt the provincial level, where 95 percent or more of criminal cases are\nhandled, claims for restitution will not exceedthe\nexperience or training of provincial judges. Criminal court procedures with\nfew, if any, changes can be adapted to process claims for restitution. Within\nthe following guidelines, victims seeking restitution should not be sent to\nanother court to process their claims.[18]1.Ability\nto Pay – Before imposing a large fine, the courts are bound by statute\nto assess the offender's ability to pay. There is no such statutory requirement\nin imposing a restitution order. Unlike a fine, a restitution order, if not\nmade part of probation, is only enforceable through civil remedies. Further, it\nmay be paid off much later, when an offender can afford to do so. Accordingly,\nlarge restitution orders can be ordered, despite the current inability of an\noffender to pay.[19]There\nis one important constraint on the amount and timing of a restitution order. If\nrehabilitation is part of a sentencing plan, the amount and timing of\nrestitution must not significantly undermine an offender's will and capacity to\npursue rehabilitation. However, demonstrating the ability to take\nresponsibility for their behaviour by compensating victims can be an integral\npart of a rehabilitation plan for many offenders. It is a direct, concrete\naction that gives meaning to an apology.[20]2.Ascertainable\nDamages – There is good reason to send the parties off to a civil\ncourt, if complex legal arguments are required to resolve the cause or amount\nof damage. There is not always good reason for the criminal courts to abandon\nthe task of ascertaining damages just because damages are not readily\nascertainable. This sets far too low a benchmark for what criminal courts\ncan and should do. If victims choose to pursue their damages in a criminal\ncourt, the criminal court ought to provide restitution, if the cause and amount\nof damages can be reasonably ascertained. If the damages cannot be\nreasonably ascertained on the information immediately available, then at least\none further hearing dedicated to determining damages should be held.[21]3.Restitution\nDetermined at Time of Sentence – Since the amount of a compensation\norder must be taken into consideration in assessing the overall severity of the\nsentence, the amount should be ascertained at the time of sentencing. This may\nrequire adjourning a sentencing hearing as the police and Crown may not have\nthe necessary information. The victim's interests cannot be ignored because the\nsentencing hearing moves ahead too quickly.[1] To\nensure sentencing takes place in a timely manner, victims must be notified and\nassisted in gathering the requisite information to substantiate a claim. Crown\ncounsel, police and victim services all can help victims fully utilize\nrestitution orders. As soon as possible, Crown should notify the offender about\nthe nature and amount of restitution being sought.Restitution\nGranted in This Case:[22]Section\n738(1):(a)in the case of damage to, or the\nloss or destruction of, the property of any person as a result of the\ncommission of the offence or the arrest or attempted arrest of the offender, by\npaying to the person an amount not exceeding the replacement value of the\nproperty as of the date the order is imposed, less the value of any part of\nthe property that is returned to that person as of the date it is returned,\nwhere the amount is readily ascertainable (emphasis mine).[23]Both\ncounsel, in submitting that replacement value consists solely of the\npurchase price of replacing damaged goods would preclude labour and other costs\nrelated to replacing the damaged property and all other losses imposed by the\ncrime. In responding to this submission, it is best to separate the victim's\nclaim for damages into two categories:i)the claim for damages directly\nrelated to replacing damaged property; andii)the claim for losses not directly\nrelated to replacing damaged property.[24]I)Replacing\nDamaged Property:The Latin origin of \"restitution\" is\n\"restitutio in integrum\", which means restoring parties to their\noriginal position. In civil law, restitution for breach of a contract aspires\nto restore the plaintiff to the position that preceded the breach. Why should\nrestitution orders be any different in criminal courts? Do we suppose victims\nwill understand why a criminal court will order payment for a new window, but\nneed to start a new action to pursue the costs of labour to install the new\nwindow?[25]\"Replace\"\nis defined by the Shorter Oxford Dictionary at page 1798 as\n\"to restore to a previous place …to put back again in a place\".\n\"Replacement\" means \"the act or process of replacing\". The\nDictionary of Canadian Law at page 1060 defines \"replacement\nvalue\" as \"the replacement in status quo ante\". These legal and\ncommon usages support the full cost of repairing the damage, not just the cost\nof new parts. In this case, the keys taken by the offender required replacing\nall locks. Total replacement costs, including purchasing and installing new\nparts, amounted to $690. All of these costs are within s. 738(1).[26]ii)Losses\nCaused by Crime:The remaining costs, arising from time spent viewing the\nvideotape and preparing the case for court, are not covered by s. 738(1). These\ncosts do not involve property damage, but relate to the time the victims were\ncalled upon by the justice system to prosecute the crime through the system.[27]Witnesses\nare modestly compensated for their time and travel expenses. Their\nparticipation is an inherent part of their responsibility as a citizen. A case\ncould be made for covering some victim expenses beyond the coverage normally\nprovided to witnesses. Based on the principles of restorative justice, the\noffender should be the first place to seek compensation for a victim's\nexpenses. What an offender cannot covershould be\ncovered by the state, since the state relies upon a victim to successfully\nprosecute violations of state laws.[28]Conclusion\n– Restitution Orders:Changes to the scope of victim compensation are\nneeded to assist in the healing journey of victims and to foster their sense of\nfairness in the justice system. For instance, the legislative distinction\nbetween compensation for property damage and for bodily harm does not always\nwork. For bodily harm, but not for property damage, restitution covers loss of\nincome. In this case, the property damage to the hotel resulted in a loss of\nincome that is not covered. Broadening the scope of restitution provides\nmeaningful alternatives to jail and enhances victim participation in and\nrespect for the justice system. Criminal courts owe victims the duty of making\nreasonable efforts to ascertain and award restitution for the losses caused by\ncrime. Few victims will understand or accept the proposition that what they\ncannot get a criminal court to do, they might get a civil court to do. It must\nremain the victim's choice. Within reasonable limits, victims should be able to\napply to either court. Why force them to take further civil action if all or\nmost of the damages can be ascertained in a criminal court?[29]Pursuing\ntheir damages in a civil court is not always easy. Victims must start all over\nagain. They are entirely on their own in bringing the offender to court and in\nproving their damages. Victims of sexual abuse proceed without the protection\nof post-O'Connor legislated shields. Victims whose claims exceed the\nlimits in small claims court face the formidable hurdles of civil action that\ncause even litigants with deep pockets to hesitate.[30]In\nmany respects, what appellate courts assume victims want does not accord with\nwhat researchers find that victims want (A. Sanders, Taking Account of\nVictims in the Criminal Justice System: A Review of the Literature\n(Edinburgh: The Scottish Central Research Unit, 1999) or with my experience of\nwhat victims want. While some victims want revenge, as expressed in harsh\nsentences, most victims want their lossescovered.\nThe more victims are involved in the system, in my experience, the more the\nfocus shifts from revenge to compensation, from punishment to rehabilitation.\nIf criminal courts had access to a more comprehensive means of addressing\ncompensation, directly from offenders and indirectly through a victim\ncompensation fund, for many victims compensation could be a more satisfactory\npart of a sentencing plan than harsh penalties. A comprehensive compensation\noption, in many respects, serves the interests of victims, offenders and the\ncommunity.PART II\n– VICTIM PARTICIPATION[31]In\nthe past decade, the victims movement has carved out an enhanced role for\nvictim involvement in sentencing. For many, the gains are not enough. At least\nit is clear — the question is no longer whether victims should participate, but\nhow they will participate.[32]The\nexperience of the victims in this case, and in many other cases, both in the\ncourtroom and in circles, warrants searching for ways to respond to the\nlegitimate and compelling claims by victims for meaningful involvement in\nsentencing. We must find ways to do so that respect the fundamental principles\nof justice.[33]In\nthis case, the victims attended all sentencing hearings. They filed victim\nimpact statements and made oral presentations. They wanted the court to know\nthat on a previous occasion they had given the offender a break for a similar\noffence. In privately working out the previous incident, they had accepted the\noffender's apology and believed they had developed an understanding and trust.\nThey wanted to share their sentiments and information about the offender. They\nhad very definite ideas about an appropriate sentence. Most of their remarks\nwere opposed by both counsel.[34]The\nlaw is clear. A victim may address the specific harm suffered, but not express\neither their views about the offender or about the sentence (R. v. Gabriel(1999),\n1999 CanLII 15050 (ON SC), 137 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (Ont. Sup. Ct.); R. v. Friginette (1994), 1994 CanLII 2208 (BC CA), 53\nB.C.A.C. 153; R. v. Coehlo, [1999] O.J. No. 2255 (Sup.\nCt.) (QL); R. v. Bremner (2000), 2000 BCCA 345 (CanLII), 138 B.C.A.C. 200). This\nlimitation is imposed not by legislation, but by the courts. The Criminal\nCode, in s. 722, describes the procedures for completing a victim impact\nstatement. Nothing in these provisions precludes or provides for any further\nvictim involvement.[35]Victims\nhave been allowed to express their views about the offender and about the\nsentence in conferences, circles and in other restorative justice sentencing\nprocesses (Gabriel, supra, at 15). Victims have also been\nallowed to comment about the offender and the sentence when both counsel agree\n(Re: Regina and Antler (1982), 1982 CanLII 386 (BC SC), 69 C.C.C. (2d) 480 (B.C.S.C.)) and,\ncuriously, when victims are supportive of the offender (R. v. Hardy\n(1976), 29 C.C.C. (2d) 84 (Qué. Sup. Ct.).[2] These\npractices are exceptions to the clear line courts have drawn preventing victims\nfrom commenting on the offender or on an appropriate sentence. With respect,\ndrawing the line at this point is untenable. After examining reasons for and\nagainst involvement, guidelines are proposed for more meaningful victim\ninvolvement in sentencing.[36]Factors\nSupporting Enhanced Involvement:In this case, the victims listened\nsilently as the offender was treated as a first-time offender. They heard a\njoint sentence submission that fell far short of their belief that \"the\nmaximum allowable sentence should be imposed\". They left in the midst of\nlegal submissions over whether they could participate. What more they may have\nsaid in court will now be said within the community. When courts shut down\ntheir voice, it is not difficult to appreciate why many victims, even those who\ndo participate by way of victim impact statements, are dissatisfied with the\njustice process (Sanders, supra, at 2). Enhanced victim involvement, if\nproperly supported and informed, can advance not just the interests of the\nvictim, but also of the offender, community and justice system.[37]1.Victim\nInterests – Not all victims want to participate. Those who do not may have\nhad, or heard about, a bad experience as a victim, or perhaps the system did\nnot appear to sufficiently welcome their participation. Unfortunately, in some\nrespects, the justice system continues to primarily function on attitudes and\nvalues that stem from a time when victims were largely ignored except to the\nextent they were essential for a trial. The justice system is just beginning to\nrespect the interests of victims. When they are properly respected, more\nvictims will become involved.[38]Most\ndo want to participate (E. Erez. \u0026 P. Tontodonato, \"The Effect of\nVictim Participation in Sentencing on Sentence Outcome\" (1990) 28\nCriminology 451) and initially perceive themselves as a party in the process.\nThey soon realize they are not. They hear the prosecutor, defence counsel, probation\nofficer and court worker make submissions and interact with the judge about\n\"their crime\", while they are relegated to sit in the gallery as a\nspectator:It is my pain, not theirs. It happened to me, not to\nthem. It is my crime to speak about, not theirs. What do they know about my\nfeelings? (Victim, after a sentencing hearing, Carcross, 1993)[39]Victims often know more about the offender\nthan any of the professionals entitled to participate:What they don't know about [the offender] would amaze\nthem. All that stuff they said in there [court] was crap. They know little\nabout what is really happening in his life. The process is a joke — a very bad\njoke — because it doesn't deal with the real world. I know more than they do.\nMost people in the community know more — know what's going on. The court hasn't\na clue. They rarely get it right because they [the courts] know so little.\n(Victim, after sentencing hearing, Haines Junction, 1994)[40]Dispatched\nto a minor role, victims watch as the process fails to \"get it\nright\". Victims believe their pain gives them a right to speak.[41]People\nfacing difficult, distressing experiences may seek help, but most expect to\nretain control over how the help sought impacts on their lives. In the very\nleast, they want to participate in shaping outcomes. Why do we think victims of\ncrime are any different?[42]Studies\nsuggest a victim impact statement does very little to answer most victims'\ndesires to participate in shaping decisions that directly affect them (Sanders,\nsupra, at 40). Some commentators suggest that victim impact statements\nare only \"successful in maintaining the time-honoured tradition of\nexcluding victims from criminal justice with a thin veneer of being a part of\nit\" (E. Erez, L. Roeger \u0026 F. Morgan, \"Victim Harm, Impact\nStatements and Victim Satisfaction with Justice\" (1997) 5 International\nRev. Criminology 37 at 37). Victim impact statements serve a purpose, albeit a\nvery narrow one. They detail specific damages and losses and provide a\ndescription of the impact of crime. Victims want more. They particularly want\nto influence outcomes. There is a widespread recognition that direct\nparticipation offers the \"greatest beneficial effects and the fewest\ndetrimental effects\", not just for the victim, but for the justice system\n(Sanders, supra, at 41).[43]In\ntelling their story, victims remind the court that crime is not just about\nbreaking a law, but also about the harm done to a person:I just wanna have a say. To be recognized as\nimportant — you know, that my story can be heard. (Victim, sentencing,\nWhitehorse, 1994)[44]Telling\ntheir story in court can be therapeutic. Victim participation can enhance their\nself-esteem and assist in closure (K. Roach, Due Process and Victims'\nRights: The New Law and Politics of Criminal Justice (Toronto: University\nof Toronto Press, 1999) at 292). By speaking directly to the offenders, judge\nand community they begin to tap their anger and pain. Significant therapeutic\nadvantages for victims flow from having a voice, and harmful effects arise from\nfeeling silenced (R.P. Wiebe, \"The Mental Health Implications of Crime\nVictims Rights\" in D.B. Wexler and B.J. Winick, eds., Law in aTherapeutic\nKey: Development in Therapeutic Jurisprudence (Durham, N.C.: Academic Press, 1996)). Whether\nvictims need to denounce or support an offender, the experience of being given\na voice, of being heard and their interests recognized as important can, for\nsome, be instrumental in their recovery.Most of what I expected in the circle — you know,\nthat it would be difficult for me and that it wouldn't make much of a\ndifference, eh — was just plain wrong. But you know, I didn't expect to speak\nas much as I did — didn't expect people would listen like they did, eh. And the\nbiggest surprise — as hard as it was in the circle — was how it helped me get\nto a good or better place in my life, eh. (Victim, Circle Participant,\nPost-Circle Comments, 1993)[45]How\ncan filing a restricted victim impact statement and sitting as a silent\nobserver in the public gallery be expected to promote closure or rebuild\nself-esteem? Currently, jurisdictions limiting a victim's participation to a\nvictim impact statement enjoy much less success in meeting the objectives of\nincreasing victim satisfaction than those jurisdictions which offer greater\nparticipation (Sanders, supra, at 41). If we intend the justice system,\nin the very least, to do no more harm to victims, we need to do more for\nvictims. While all the needs of victims cannot be met in a court, the failure\nof other agencies to respond provides no reason for courts not to do more.[46]Victims\nprecluded from direct participation in shaping sentencing decisions regard the\nprocess as excessively focused on the plight of offenders. This emphasis on\noffenders is likely to intensify. As courts respond to the calls to minimize\nthe use of jails and maximize community and other resources to rehabilitate\noffenders (Gladue, supra), the imbalance in the focus of the\njustice system between offenders and victims may worsen. This imbalance feeds\ntheir impression that the process is neither fair to, nor respectful of\nvictims.[47]A\nsense of fairness is often more related to process than to outcome. Meaningful\nparticipation in the decision-making process induces feelings of fairness and,\nin turn,fosters\nacceptance of outcomes. When victims participate directly in restorative\njustice processes, victims find the process the process fair and their\nemotional needs more effectively met than in court (Sanders, supra, at\n15). Often just being invited to participate, even if they do not, regardless\nof the outcome, increases victim satisfaction with the process. Victim\nsatisfaction is often more related to the degree of their involvement than the\noutcome of the process (Sanders, supra, at 31). The more participatory\nthe process, the more satisfied the victims (A. Morris, \"Giving Victims a\nVoice: A New Zealand Experiment\" (1993) 32 Harvard L.J. at 304). The more\nvictims know, the more they want to know. However, it is not just more information,\nbut more involvement in shaping sentences that improves their satisfaction with\nthe process (A. Sanders, et al., \"Victim Impact Statements: Don't Work,\nCan't Work\" (2001) Crim. L.R. 477 at 452).[48]My\nexperience is anecdotal and selective, as most of the victims I have spoken to\napproached me. On this limited sampling, victims who have been able to speak,\neither in the courtroom or in a circle, are very appreciative for the\nopportunity. Most important, they begin to move beyond their anger, beyond the\ndark space the crime has driven them into, when their voice is heard and\nrespected. For the most part, judges do not hear the wrath, frustration and\npain victims feel when shut out of the process. If we were more exposed to the\nimpact of our processes, we might be a lot less content with how the process\nfunctions.[49]The\nchanges driven by restorative justice have largely been shunted off to\ncommunity initiatives. Courts have accepted an expanded voice for victims in\ncommunity initiatives, such as circles, conferences, and diversion, but not in\nthe courtroom (Gabriel, supra). Is it that judges cannot\nappropriately respond to victims but communities can? Judges can and should\ntake the time to hear from and respond to victims. Victims deserve a full\nexplanation from the court about how the sentence imposed incorporates their\ninterests or why the sentence they seek cannot be. The reasons given for a\nsentence must address all affected interests. To do so, all interests must be\nheard. In neither hearing nor responding to victims, the court engenders theirdisrespect\nfor the process and may intensify the harm caused by the crime by failing to\nrespect their interests. As in restorative justice processes, the court can do\nmuch more in addressing the needs of victims without undermining the rights and\nneeds of offenders.[50]2.Offender\nInterests – When victims participate in the process, their voice has a\nsalutary impact on offenders in two ways. First, their voice shifts the\nhandling of crime from a legalistic and tactical, adversarial game to the\nintimate and difficult human interaction that it is. Offenders need to hear and\nexperience the human dimension of crime. The pain, anger and suffering of\nvictims leaves little room for offenders to gloss over their criminal\nbehaviour. For example, in break-and-enter offences, offenders tend to diminish\nthe severity of their actions by assuming it is \"just about property …\nthey had lots of stuff in that house. What we took didn't amount to much.\nBesides, insurance will cover it.\" (Young offender, private discussion,\n1994) When they hear the pain of victims, whose feelings of safety in their\nhomes has been violated, their crime takes on a significantly different\nmeaning:I never thought about that — man, when they started\ncrying, I could see their pain, eh. Man, that got to me. Like, really, I never\nthought about that, eh. You know, they're right — how can they even feel safe\nin their own home after what we did. (Young offender, private discussion, 1994)[51]Whatever\na victim impact statement may do to \"bring home to the offender the\nconsequences of criminal behaviour\" (Gabriel, supra, at 11),\nvictims speaking openly to an offender brings it all home to an offender in a\nway that cannot be ignored. Some victims want to confront offenders. In\npreventing these victims from doing so, we send a clear message that we are\nprotecting offenders from facing their victims. No wonder victims feel\n\"the system favours and protects offenders. They have a lawyer. We don't.\nThey can speak to the court. We can't. Shit — we can't even speak to our\noffenders in court. You protect them from our anger. This justice system is an\noffender's justice system. That's all it is.\" (Ex-victim and victim\nsupporter after court, Carmacks, 1993)[52]In\nthe very least, offenders ought to face the pain of their victims. They cannot\nbe forced to respond, but they ought to be forced to listen. It can be much\nmore salutary for offenders to hear about the human dimension of their crime\nfrom a victim than from a judge.[53]Second,\nthe support, understanding — even, at times, forgiveness — of victims has an\nenormous impact on the ability of offenders to successfully pursue their\nrehabilitation plan.Before, you know, other times in the court, eh — no\none from my community showed up, and all I saw from victims was, like, just\nanger. I know — like, guessed — I guess people hated me. That was a hard thing,\nbut I learned, I guess, eh, not to care. Now, this time it really helped to\nknow the community supported me, and I know [the victims] — well, they kinda\nsupport me, too. Makes me feel good about myself. Like, I think I'm gonna do it\nthis time — like, make it sober. (Offender, Kwanlin Dun, 1992)[54]In shutting down the voice of victims,\ntheir anger is intensified. Angry victims can undermine the ability of\noffenders to find and retain community support. Especially, but not\nexclusively, in small communities an offender's ability to reconnect to his/her\ncommunity and to get on and stay on a healing journey can be affected by what a\nvictim feels about the sentence and about the offender.[55]My experience supports the experience of\nmany other judges — victims, when respected and given an appropriate means to\nbe heard, are less inclined to reject outcomes and their participation impacts\nconstructively, both on their healing and on the healing journey of offenders.[56]3.Community\nInterests – Victims' concerns, when denied expression in the court, do not\njust fade away. The voices shut down in court are intensified in homes, in\ncommunity gatherings and in the media. By allowing and responding to victim\ninputs inthe\ncourtroom, the courts enable a vital dialogue to occur. This dialogue enables\nthe court to appreciate the victim's perspective and for victims to hear and\nhopefully appreciate the court's perspective. When victims participate, they\nare more likely to listen and to accept the court's reasons for a sentence.\nVictim participation enables the court, in giving reasons for a sentence, to\nspeak not just to offenders, but to victims and the community as well. If we\nfail to do so, there is little chance the underlying rationale for our\npractices will be effectively explained in the community by anyone else.[57]4.Best\nInterest of Justice System – The justice system benefits in many ways from\nmeaningful victim participation. The decision-making process is better\ninformed. Outcomes are shaped to embrace a more comprehensive reach of\ninterests. With a broader base of support, sentences are more likely to succeed.\nOverall, victim participation results in better decisions and in improving\ntheir understanding of what the justice system can and cannot achieve.[58]Many\nyears ago, the Ontario Court of Appeal suggested \"the courts do not have\nto reflect public opinion … perhaps the main duty of the court is to lead\npublic opinion\" (R. v. Sargeant (1974), 60 Cr. App. R. (Ont.\nC.A.) 74 at 77). To responsibly \"lead public opinion\" about\nsentencing, courts need to hear from and respond to victims. Courts cannot assume\nthe Crown speaks for victims. The Crown speaks primarily for the state. The\ninterests and perspectives of the state and victim can often be very different.\nHearing from the victim is an important part in gaining community credibility\nfor court decisions and for taking any leadership in precipitating an informed\ncommunity dialogue about sentencing.[59]Some\nfear that an enhanced victim's voice will generate \"offender-bashing\ncampaigns and 'get tough' criminal policies\" (C. Ruby, \"From Crime\nPolicy to Victim Policy: Reconciling the Justice System\" (1987/88) 13\nCrim. L.Q. 126). Conversely, I fear that by limiting the victim's voice we fuel\ntheir frustration and anger, and leave them with no place to go except to the\nstreets to press for harsher penalties. Giving victims a voice, giving their\npain and suffering the respect it deserves, and allowing them to participate in\nthe dialogue about \"their crime\" provides a more direct and\nmeaningful expression of their interests. We need to have more confidence in our\nsystem and in victims. The system can be understood and accepted by most\nvictims if they are not shut out. Victims can appreciate and respect the\nprinciples governing the justice system if we invest the time in supporting,\nexplaining and involving them in a meaningful way. It is not by involving them,\nbut by shutting them out, that \"offender-bashing campaigns\" are\ngalvanized.[60]Summary:The pressure from victims for a greater voice is both relentless and\ncompelling. The advantages of including the victim in a more meaningful way are\nclear. By assessing the factors that have denied or restricted victim\nparticipation, the means for engaging victims in a more meaningful way can be\nexplored.[61]Barriers\nTo Increasing Victim Participation:Many judges throughout Canada have\ngone much further than the appellate court boundaries allow. Judges who\nactively invite victims to speak about a possible sentence and the totality of\ntheir experience have not encountered the difficulties anticipated by appellate\ncourts.[62]Each\nstep towards meaningful victim participation has not experienced inordinate\ndifficulties. The alarms of fear set off by initial plans to introduce victim\nimpact statements were all false alarms. If anything, victim impact statements\nhave failed to live up to our expectations to provide a respectful and\neffective way to include victims. In Gabriel, supra, at 11, the\ncourt summarized what was expected of victim impact statements:•providing direct evidence of the\nimpact of the crime•bringing home to the offender the\nconsequences of criminal behaviour•giving the victim the\nsatisfaction of being heard•providing the victim with asense of regaining control over his/her life•alleviating the frustration of\ndetachment when a victim perceives he/she is ignored•ensuring in sentencing that the\nvictim is not reduced to obscurity — an intolerable departure from respect for\nthe personal integrity of the victim[63]Undoubtedly,\nvictim impact statements serve some of these purposes. However, victims are not\nsatisfied with the level of participation provided by victim impact statements\n(Sanders, supra). A more direct victim voice to speak not just about\ndamages, but also about their perspective on the offender and sentence,\nrealizes all of these purposes in a more substantial manner than a victim\nimpact statement.[64]The\nchallenge is not to hold the line drawn by appellate courts, but to explore how\nto maximize victim participation without unduly undermining the fundamental\nprinciples of the justice process and without causing the problems flagged by\nappellate courts. Exploring how to enhance the victim's voice begins by\nassessing the barriers currently used to oppose more than the stilted\nparticipation granted by victim impact statements.[65]The\nreasons commonly trotted out to deny victims the ability to speak about an\noffender and to express their view about an appropriate sentence are:•Sentencing is a two-party process\ninvolving only the state and the offender•Courts are not a social agency•Victims will be disruptive to the\ncourt process•Victim participation will produce\nsentencing disparities[66]Two-Party\nSystem – Courts constantly remind victims seeking greater participation\nthat sentencing \"is not a tripartite proceeding. A convicted offender has\ncommitted a crime — an act against society as a whole. It is a public interest,\nnot a private interest, which is to be served in sentencing.\" (Gabriel,\nsupra, at 12). In adhering to this notion, criminal courts shunt victims\noff to civil courts to redress their wrongs (Gabriel, supra, at\n2).[67]The\nnotion that the criminal justice process is, for all purposes, exclusively a\ntwo-party system is a remarkable example of the arbitrary division of\nresponsibilities that cripples government and, until wiser counsel prevailed,\nhad stymied the growth of contemporary businesses. The more progressive\ncorporations recognized their challenges cannot be divided and delegated to\nseparate agencies to address (P. Senge, The Fifth Discipline:The Art and\nPractice of The Learning Organization (New York: Doubleday, 1994)). Those\ngovernments and businesses that continue to do so, continue to fail, regardless\nof how many additional resources they invest in truncated approaches.\nSuccessful corporations realize that an integrated collaborative approach that\ngenerates the capacity for a systemic analysis of the problem and wholistic\nresponses is required (C. Argyris, Overcoming Organizational Defences,\n(New York: Prentice Hall, 1990)). Similarly, the challenges facing sentencing\ncourts call for holistic responses that build on a systemic analysis of how\nmany factors interact. Restricting the voice of victims diminishes the court's\nability to integrate key factors that the victim can contribute to developing\nholistic sentencing plans.[68]In\na restorative justice process, participation is encouraged from all facets of\nthe community interested in or affected by the crime and the resultant\nsentencing plans draw from the perspectives and resources of all participants.\nThis is precisely as it should be.[69]Any\nlongstanding notion, such as the exclusivity of a two-party criminal process,\nmust be regularly questioned to determine if its rationale remains relevant and\nif it continues to effectively advance current public interests. The longevity\nof any practice is not sufficient reason to retain it. There must be more.\nIncantations to \"time immemorial\" practices are often offered up as\nan emotional defence against pressing needs for change. As Hans Mohr, in his\ncharacteristically penetrating insight has warned: \"References to 'times\nimmemorial' contain as much forgetfulness as they contain memory and are\nlargely used for the purpose of legitimation when other grounds cannot be found\nor cannot be disclosed.\" (J.W. Mohr, \"Criminal Law: Is There a Legal\nor a Social Logic Left For Its Renewal?\" in P. Fitzgerald ed. Crime,\nJustice \u0026 Codification (Toronto: Carswell, 1986) at 33). We seem to\nhave forgotten the important role victims and communities played when they\nshared responsibility for dealing with conflict. At one time, victims had a\nparamount role in working through offences against their person or property.\nThe reasons that supported the state's assumption of responsibility several\nhundred years ago, if valid then, may not be today. Certainly, the almost\nexclusive role of the state, and relatively minor role of the victim, warrant\nreconsideration.[70]In\nthe very least, exploring avenues for according victims and communities a more\nmeaningful voice without granting full-party status can retain what is\nessential for court-based sentencing process and give way on what is not.[71]From\nthe perspective of victims, the question is not whether they should be granted\na special status; they already have one. The question is whether this special\nstatus can be enhanced without undermining the fundamental principles of\njustice and without adversely impacting on the sentencing process. The answers\nto both questions, based on experience in the courtroom and in restorative\njustice forums, is yes. Many American states (35) have relied on legislation to\ngrant victims the ability to submit their views about an appropriate sentence\n(R. Elias, Victims Still, (California: Sage Publications, 1993). These\nlegislative innovations have not caused havoc with their two-party adversarial\ncourt process. There are ways to maintain the integrity of a two-party system\nin sentencing and grant victims a more meaningful participation. The right to\ncall evidence, to cross-examine, or to appeal is not required to afford victims\na more significant voice in sentencing.[72]Court:\"Not a Social Agency\" – In justifying the limitation on a\nvictim's involvement, the court in Gabriel, supra, at 12\nnoted that the trial court was \"not a social agency\". It is as if\nbeing regarded as a social agency demeans the purity of a legal response to\nwhat, in almost every sentencing, is principally a social problem. What is\nimportant is not the maintenance of truncated responsibilities, but an openness\nto what is required to \"get it right\".I don't give a damn what the law says, what you say\nthe law says, or what some appeal judges say it is. But if you don't get it\nright — get it right for this offender, for this victim and for this community\n— the mess this crime creates will get a lot worse. (First Nation leader,\nHaines Junction, 1993)[73]\"Getting\nit right\" in very few cases calls for only legal responses. To \"get\nit right\", those with skills honed for courtrooms need to acknowledge\ntheir limitations and welcome collaboration with those who possess the skills\nand resources to ensure sentences contribute to \"getting it right\".[74]Breaking\nthe cycle of criminal behaviour that locks many offenders into recidivism and\nthereby to progressively longer jail sentences requires engaging resources that\nsocial agencies can bring to sentencing (treatment, training, housing,\nliteracy, financial and other supports). These resources are often required to\nextract the full potential of sentencing as a catalystic force for change.\nWhile the court is not a social agency, it can provide the opportunity for many\nsocial agencies to combine their services with those of the court to forge a\nplan that serves the interests of offenders, victims and communities.[75]Will\nIncrease Sentencing Disparities – Some fear that giving victims a voice\nwill produce harsher penalties (Antler, supra; R. v. Robinson\n(1983), 38 C.R. (3d) 255 (Ont. H.C.J.)). These concerns presume the vengeance\nand anger of victims will unduly influence judges. These presumptions portray\nan unflattering impression of victims and judges — a portrayal that is not\nborne out by experience. A study of victim opinion statements (includes\nvictims' views of offenders and of appropriate sentences) used in sexual\nassault cases found little significant impact on outcomes (A. Walsh,\n\"Placebo Justice\" (1986) J. of Crim. L. and Criminology 126). A\nbroadly based survey of different types of victim input concluded that the fear\nsentences will be distorted and made more punitive as a result of victim participation\nwas unwarranted (For research, see Sanders, supra, at 40; Erez, supra,\nat 457. For contra-opinion, see H. Rubel, Victim Participation in Sentencing,\n(1985-86) 28 Crim. L.Q. 226; Stuart, D., Annotation (1984), 38 C.R. (3d)\n256).[76]My\nexperience with restorative justice practices here and in other jurisdictions\nprincipally indicates that victims, when given a full opportunity to\nparticipate, are not as interested in being as punitive as is commonly assumed.\nIn circles, when offenders take full responsibility for their actions and\ndemonstrate earnest attempts to be rehabilitated, victims are generally less\ninterested in jail sentences and more interested in sentences that reflect, in\na concrete manner, what offenders will do to take responsibility for past\nactions and to change future conduct. The more victims participate, the more\nthey know about the offender, the offender's family and community, the more\nlikely they will support a constructive sentencing plan that avoids or\ndrastically reduces dependence upon jail.[77]Often\nvictims call for jail sentences because they are not aware of alternatives or\nof the costly ineffectiveness of jail (Rubel, supra, 236). In circles,\nvictims apprised of alternatives often support sentencing plans that avoid or\nminimize dependence on jail.[78]Introducing\nthe victim's voice worries some that the neutrality of the court will be\ncompromised (R. v. Porter (1976), 33 C.C.C. (2d) 215 (Ont. C.A.)\nat 220; Gabriel, supra, at 16). While many justice professionals\nseem to share this opinion, none of the research I found validates this\nassumption. Courts have not been swayed or compromised by victim participation\n(Sanders, supra, at 34). If anything, public perception of the court's\nneutrality may be more jeopardized by shutting out the victim.[79]3.Disruptive\nEffect of Vengeful Victims –In Gabriel, supra, at 13, the\ncourt suggests that a \"runaway model\" of victim participation would\nfill the court with victims, who cannot distinguish between vengeance and\nretribution. They will come to court screaming for offenders to be harshly\npunished.[80]The\nscreams for vengeance seem much louder, more insistent from victims shut out of\nany meaningful participation. What is not expressed in an emotional, but\nappropriate way in court can be shouted in anger and frustration in the\nstreets. In both courts and restorative justice processes, the more victims\nparticipate, the more they manifest an understanding of the difference between\nvengeance and retribution. It is the insult of being shut down that inflames\ntheir pain into vengeance. It is this insult that contributes to galvanizing\npolitical pressures for change around single issues.[81]The\nfear about a \"runaway model\" also assumes victims cannot understand\nor respect the court process. Again, my experience is quite different. My\nexperience suggests that victims, if respected, act respectfully. Today,\nvictims have access to professional victim services. This access helps victims\nappreciate the limitations of the court process and prepares them to\neffectively participate.[82]Finally,\nthe fear of victim participation generating a \"runaway model\" assumes\njudges cannot handle outbursts by angry, emotionally charged victims in the\ncourtroom. Extensive training through the National Judicial Institute, and many\nother fine programs about victims' issues, about dealing with strong, difficult\nemotions, has prepared judges to deal with the strong emotions surrounding\ncrime.[83]In\nrestricting the victim's view, we seem to assume sentencing can best be\nconducted by shutting out the emotions that permeate the process. For what\npurpose? So that the sanctity of the law will not be tarnished by emotions? Are\nwe so focused on \"head talk\" that we cannot permit any \"heart\ntalk\"? Stripped of all emotional aspects, sentencing discussions of crime\nin principally legal terms offends some victims.I can't believe — as lawyers battled over the law and\nspoke about what should or should not happen to [the offender] no one spoke of\nthe human parts of the crime — about what it did to my business, my family, and\nabout what it did to me. I was hurt and offended that sentencing was not much\nmore than a bunch of legal talk. (Victim, Private discussion, 1994)[84]What\nmakes restorative justice processes so much more successful, on many levels,\nthan the court is the space created for hearts to talk. If we want sentencing\nto be a pivotal experience for change, we must engage all the dynamics\nsurrounding sentencing. We fail to appreciate that embracing the emotional and\nspiritual dynamics surrounding sentencing enhances the capacity of the\nsentencing process to make a lasting, positive impact on the lives of all\nparticipants. Judges can handle the emotional expressions of victims. The\nprocess may take longer. Some victims may be disruptive. But allowing victims a\nvoice, especially an emotional voice, can be a constructive learning experience\nfor the offender, the victim and the court.[85]Summary:The reasons stacked up against increasing victim involvement fail on several\nfronts to hold the line currently drawn by appellate courts. First, most of the\nreasons (vengeful victims, sentencing disparities, disruptive interferences)\nare based on assumptions, not research. Currently, most of the research\nsubstantially refutes the underlying assumptions shaping restrictions on victim\nparticipation. Second, the insistence on preserving a two-party process,\nalthough an unnecessarily restrictive view, has little to do with giving\nvictims a voice. Victims are not seeking party status, just seeking to speak\ntheir mind about the offender and the outcome. Jurisdictions which have given\nthe victim a voice have not experienced untold destruction of the process.\nThird, some courts suggest the legislation in creating victim impact statements\nhas limited victim participation. That is simply not so. It is not the\nlegislation denying the victim a voice, but the courts.[3][86]Fourth,\nnone of the reasons limiting victim participation address the impact on victims\nwhen their voices are ignored or shut down. Finally, there has not been a\nsatisfactory assessment of how including the victim in sentencing could benefit\nthe offender, the community and the justice system.[87]Enhancing\nVictim Involvement:How victim interests can best be addressed ought to be\nprimarily left to those who work with victims and whose expertise provides a\nmore informed perspective than what judges and counsel can glean from their\nexperiences. If the justice system aspires to do no more harm, and to at least\nfunction in a manner that respects those already harmed, any change must be\ninformed by what actually happens, not by what is assumed to happen.[88]In\nthis case, as in many others, when a victim's voice is ignored, they feel\ndisrespected. We not only fail to garner their support for the outcome, but we\nexacerbate their suffering and generate anger with the justice system. We must\ndo better — and we can.[89]The\nfollowing guidelines ought to govern any new measures courts explore to\nincrease victim participation:•No Pressure to Participate – Victims must not be subjected to any pressure to\nparticipate. Each victim must be free of any pressure in choosing whether, how\nand when they might participate.•Informed Choice – Victims must be fully apprised of their options to\nparticipate.•Supported – Any participation must be supported by victim\nservices, community justice workers or others qualified to provide the level of\nsupport each victim seeks or needs.•Respect – Their voices must be heard and responded to in a\nrespectful manner.[90]Within\nthese guidelines, a victim can, if they desire to do so, speak about the\noffender and provide their view of an appropriate sentence if a victim:•has been fully briefed. Either a prosecutor victim services worker should\nbrief the victim about:·usual range of sentences for\noffenders·relevant sentencing principles·what can and cannot be given\nweight in sentencing•has met with prosecutor. The prosecutor should brief the victim about the\nunderlying processes for the specific sentencing submission he/she intends to\nmake. It is not important that prosecutors represent victims. It is important\nthat prosecutors hear their concerns, explain the position of the prosecutor in\nsentencing and assist victims in understanding the limits of the process. In\nsome jurisdictions, the prosecutors are experimenting with directly\ncommunicating with victims (Erez \u0026 Tontodonato, supra, at 458).In Yukon, the Crown aspires to spend time with victims and maximize\ntheir awareness of the process. Yukon prosecutors have created procedures to\nensure the input of victims is sought with respect to major decisions and that\nvictims are provided with clear and comprehensive information about the legal\nprocess. These procedures include:·being available before court to\nspeak to victims·working with the victim service\nworker to ensure victims are aware of what is likely to happen in court·communicating the victim's\nposition, needs and concerns to the court; and·meeting with the victim after\ncourt to explain what happened in court.(Taken from Crown\nprotocol for DVTO Court)•is aware of overall\ncircumstances. Preferably, victims\nwho wish to speak should be in attendance for all of the sentencing hearing to\nbe fully aware ofthe overall circumstances. If not in attendance, before participating a\nvictim service worker should update the victim about what the offender has done\nand about any relevant evidence submitted to the court. \"If more were\nexplained, less would appear unfair, insensitive or incomprehensible.\"\n(Sanders, et al., supra, at 453). Victim services are filling in more of\nthe enormous gaps in victim understanding of the process. All professionals in\nthe system must make an effort to explain the process and keep victims updated\non all developments in the case. It is important to hear the perspective of the\nvictim at the time of sentencing (Erez \u0026 Tontodonato, supra, at\n546). Victim inputs should reflect what has happened since the crime. Victims\nare significantly relieved when informed that offenders have made important\nstrides towards accepting responsibility and acting responsibly. Knowledge can\nchange their perspective on whether to participate and on what outcomes they\nwish to see.I did want to participate. I did want to see him go\nto jail. But it did help me to get on with my life to know that he was in\ntreatment — really in treatment, not just talking about it — and that people in\nthe community were committed to see him through it. I got a long way to go, but\nknowing what he was doing, who was involved, helped me for sure. (Victim,\nCircle, Carmacks, 1993)[91]In\nsome cases, many of these preconditions will be readily waived by the court as\nthe nature of the case will not warrant such elaborate precautions.[92]Conclusion:The paramouncy of the public interest in determining an appropriate\nsentence need not preclude the victim's input (Contra, see Coehlo,\nsupra; Friginette, supra.[93]We\nrisk little by exploring ways of expanding opportunities for victim\nparticipation. We risk more than we seem to appreciate by hiding behind ancient\npractices to deny the legitimate needs for an enhanced victim role in\nsentencing.[94]Victims\nare much more capable than assumed by the courts of understanding the system\nand its limitations, of recognizing and respecting the values inherent in the\nsentencing process, and of making constructive contributions in an appropriate,\nalbeit often emotional manner. Trial court judges are more capable of hearing\nfrom victims without being swayed by the emotional dynamics of victim participation\nand much more capable of explaining sentencing principles and practices to\nvictims than contemporary jurisprudence acknowledges.[95]While\neach crime is different, and responsibilities for the underlying causes and for\nresolutions different, everyone needs to regard crime as an invaluable learning\nexperience. Crime teaches all of us what is remiss within our communities and\nfamilies and offers up an opportunity for learning how to work together, to\nshare responsibility for removing the conditions that render families and\ncommunities vulnerable to crime. No one should be shut out of the process;\neveryone should be encouraged to participate.[96]Courts\nowe victims not just a chance to speak, but owe them a response. Our body of\nsentencing principles purports to encompass the values of our society. Complex\nand often conflicting, these principles must be examined and explained in each\ncase. The explanation of a sentence in the context of these principles is owed\nto victims, offenders and the community. If the judge does not explain the\napplication of these principles to the victim, who will?[97]Holmes\nwas right: \"The life of the law is not logic, but experience.\" Within\nthe legal community, we have fallen prey to self-supporting concepts and seem\nto believe that Holmes' \"experience\" embraces only the experience of\nlaw within the courtroom. We have increasingly failed to appreciate and learn\nfrom the impact of law on the larger community it is intended to serve. The\nlogic of separating conflicts into civil and criminal courts is not understood\nby homeowners, whose sanctuary has been breached by burglars. Parents of young\nchildren brutally slain can neither accept nor respect why they can watch but\nnot speak. We disrespect the victim's experience of loss when we shut down\nhis/her voice in the sentencing process. If criminal courts shut out the voices\nof key participants, we cannot except to foster either public respect for, or\nacceptance of the justice system.[98]By\nstepping back from active interference with sentencing, appellate courts have\nencouraged trial courts to develop viable solutions to the specific challenges\nin each case. To generate viable solutions, courts must be open to appreciate\nand respond to the dynamics and needs in each case. Doing so will require\npushing, bending and, at times, breaking longstanding attitudes and notions\nabout sentencing practices, and especially about victim participation. For\nsentencing to generate pivotal changes in the lives of victims, offenders and\nthe community, courts must be open to question longstanding legal practices.\nWhat ought to be continued is what continues to work — not just to advance the\npurity of legal interests, but to advance the much broader interests of\ndeveloping a constructive, relevant, effective sentencing process that serves\nall affected interests. No institution that ignores voices for change survives.\nIf we exclude victims, if we fail to directly face and respectfully explain the\nprinciples and practices that shape our processes, we will not survive as a\nvaluable contributor in responding to the harm crime imposes.They done made themselves kinda useless by not payin'\nattention to what's goin' on. Shuttin' down on people or change — soon enough\nand sure enough shuts you down. Any damn fool gotta see that. (Willie Can,\n1968)_______________________________STUART, C.J.T.C.[1] Delegating to a probation officer the task of working\nout the amount of restitution with the victim and offender has been condemned\nby Appeal Courts (R. v. Shorter and Shorter (1976), 29 C.C.C.\n(2d) 528 (B.C.C.A.); R. v. Hudson (1981), 65 C.C.C. (2d) 171\n(Ont. C.A.)). Given the choice (especially on circuit) of postponing a sentence\nfor several months to acquire more reliable information that will readily resolve\na dispute over the amount, and ignoring a victim's request for compensation,\nanother option must be created. If only the amount of damages is unclear, but\nthe range of damages is roughly known, a sentence can be imposed and\nrestitution fixed at the high end of the range, leaving the exact amount to be\ndetermined at a review.[2] Victims should not only be permitted to speak if the\noffender consents or if their input is supportive. This basis for victim input\nsuggests only appeased victims can speak and that offenders have a veto over\nvictim participation.[3] While courts have been reluctant to open the door for\nvictims to be heard, the Legislature, in the proposed new Act to deal with\nyoung offenders, seems to embrace the idea fully. Section 18(d)(iii):Victims should be\nprovided with information about the proceedings and given an opportunityto participate and be\nheard (emphasis mine)."}

Keith Ham) delivered on\nSeptember 26, 2002.[2]The case was heard on a period of nine days in\n2002 and is related to infractions to municipal by-laws of the former City of\nWestmount.[3]The Appellant was convicted of fifteen counts as\n“fiduciaire” of La Fiducie Atwater, owner of a building bearing civic\nnumber 3035 St-Antoine Street West.[4]The Appellant who is representing himself filed\nas Notes and Authorities a document called “BRIEFING: The Tragedy and\nAct of Evil of the City of Westmount resulted from the Characters and\ninadequately Competent Directors”.[5]The aforesaid document is not easy to understand\nand is described by the council of Respondent as follows:“That on almost every page of the\nsaid brief the Appellant has alleged new material, referred to hearsay\nevidence, uttered potentially libellous statements and included totally\nirrelevant material to the matter before this Honourable Court.”[6]The Appellant is convinced that the City of\nWestmount and its employees are guilty against him of religious discrimination\n(anti-Semitism) and harassment.[7]The Appellant was not able to make any valid\ndemonstration of these serious accusation.[8]Nor the Appellant was he able to indicate\nclearly to the Court where the municipal judge made a mistake in fact or in law\nin his judgment.[9]The appeal on the fifteen counts is dismissed.[10]The Appellant is also appealing of the sentence\npronounced by the Municipal Court.[11]The first judge decided to sentence Appellant to\nthe minimum fine prescribed by the municipal by-laws and considered that the\nAppellant was a “personne morale”.[12]The proof indicates that the Appellant\ntransferred the property of his building to his children by creating a trust in\ntheir favour. The trust was established by contract without the creation of a\ncorporation.[13]Pursuant to section 1260 ss. of Québec Civil\nCode, the Appellant is the trustee of a private trust and remains an individual\nor “personne physique”.[14]Considering these facts, the fine prescribed by\nmunicipal by-laws is different from that what was decided by the Municipal\nCourt.[15]The Appeal of the sentence is granted and the\nfine will be adjusted accordingly.[16]The Appellant also asks the Court to adjudicate\non the following petition:Mr. Donovan in my previous\nappearance in court confessed that Westmount has another new case against me in\naddition to what you see now.

VealeAppearances:Amy PorteousCounselfor the RespondentVincent LarochelleCounselfor the AppellantREASONS\nFOR JUDGMENTINTRODUCTION[1]Ms. J. pled guilty to an assault contrary to\ns. 266 of the Criminal Code before a judge of the Territorial Court.\nThe Crown submitted that a suspended sentence with probation was the\nappropriate sentence. The defence advocated for a conditional discharge.[2]The sentencing judge convicted Ms. J. and\nimposed a suspended sentence, resulting in a criminal record. He focussed on\nMs. J.’s admission in the Pre-Sentence Report that she smoked marijuana\ndaily and would continue to do so. He found that it would be contrary to the\npublic interest to give a conditional discharge to an offender who says she\nwill continue to possess marijuana, despite the fact that it is currently\nillegal to do so.[3]Ms. J. appeals her conviction and the issue\nis whether a conditional discharge, in the circumstances of Ms. J., is\ncontrary to the public interest.THE FACTS[4]Ms. J. is a 57-year-old citizen of the Vuntut\nGwich’in First Nation, which is based in O[…]. O[…] is a small First Nation\nvillage in northern Yukon. There is no road access. There are approximately 221\nresidents.[5]On December 29, 2016, Ms. J. was in the O[…]\ngrocery store with her adult daughter. Ms. J. began to swear at the\ncomplainant and, after a brief period of time, grabbed her by the coat and\npunched her in the face, injuring her lower lip. Ms. J. then said she\nwould run the complainant out of town and that she should “get the fuck out of\ntown”. The store manager intervened and the incident ended.The Victim Impact Statement[6]Although there is no lasting physical injury, the\ncomplainant has been affected by the assault, which was in a very public place\nin a small community.[7]She states that there are continuing impacts\nupon her from the supporters or members of Ms. J.’s family. There was no\nfinding of fact in that regard but I accept that it is an impact felt by the\ncomplainant.The Pre-Sentence Report[8]The Pre-Sentence Report is the source of most of\nthe information about Ms. J. considered in the sentencing hearing. Ms. J.\nhas one previous discharge in 1988.[9]Ms. J. was 56 at the time of this incident\nand has always resided in O[…]. She was raised by her mother, who was\nessentially a single parent. She has had little contact with her biological\nfather. She had a stepfather and remembers some contact with him, but he froze\nto death when she was a young child.[10]Ms. J. described her relationship with her\nmother as positive but there was drinking, abuse and spousal violence in the\nhome from a young age. Her mother struggled with alcohol until the age of 50\nwhen she stopped drinking. Her mother had 11 children but not all were raised\nby her. Ms. J. recalls spending a lot of weekends with her grandparents while\nher mother drank. Her mother died tragically after a fall through the ice in\n2000 and losing her has been difficult. She has recently started to come to\nterms with the violence and abuse she experienced as a child and this has been\na source of considerable stress.[11]Ms. J. is unemployed and has had some\nchallenges maintaining employment.She is currently a single parent with two daughters.[12]Ms. J. has had an alcohol problem but reports\nthat she has been sober for five years. Alcohol was not a factor in the\nincident with the complainant.[13]The probation officer reported the following\ninformation that is the issue before the Court:Ms [J.]\nreports to smoking marijuana on a daily basis to “calm [herself] down”. Ms [J.]\nadvised that since seeing [her counsellor] more regularly (since February of\n2017) she has gone from “smoking six (6) joints a day down to two (2) joints a\nday”. Ms [J.] stated that this usage is “not that much”, does not consider\nit to be a problem, and does not wish to stop at this time.[14]Ms. J. justified her assault by describing\nin some detail a past event which occurred some 10 years earlier, where she\nalleges that she was beaten up by a group that included the complainant. She\nwas injured but no criminal charges resulted. This is her justification for\nassaulting the complainant.[15]The probation officer reported:Ms [J.]\nsaid she would not be agreeable to writing an apology letter because [the\ncomplainant] never apologized to her. In contrast to this, Ms [J.] told\nthe writer that she was going to stand up at court and say “I’m sorry I was\nwrong”. The writer questioned Ms[J.] with regard to the discrepancy\nbetween what she told the writer and what she was planning on telling the\ncourt, to which Ms [J.] stated that she “would not say [she’s] sorry” but\nthat she knows she was wrong.[16]After the Pre-Sentence Report was prepared and\nfollowing further counselling, counsel for Ms. J. filed the following\napology letter.I\nwish to apologize to the court and to the complainant for my actions and\nattitude that has brought me before the court. I have been attending counseling\nsince the incident and it helps me to focus on myself. I have also been\nvolunteering with the elders and working. I am very sorry I have come before\nthe court and I will not do it again. I am embarrassed by being here. I hope\nthat the complainant will accept my apology as I take full responsibility for\nmy actions that have brought me here today.[17]The counsellor confirmed in a letter to the\ncourt:… [she]\nhas done well in our sessions and I have no reservations concerning her honesty\nand or her effort during our time together. She states that our sessions have\nbeen helpful to her and we plan on continuing to meet regularly to discuss past\nhistory and the anxiety present now.…[18]Since being charged, Ms. J. has also acted as a\nvolunteer to assist two elders in O[…].THE TRIAL JUDGMENT[19]The trial judge gave oral Reasons for Sentence\nin O[…]. He addressed the concern arising out of the Pre-Sentence Report that\nwhile Ms. J. accepts responsibility for her actions, she still blames the\ncomplainant for what took place 10 years ago. Nevertheless, he accepted the\nassertions in her letter that she knew it was wrong and that she is sorry.[20]Although it was not raised by either Crown or\ndefence, the trial judge raised the issue of marijuana use by Ms. J. He\nacknowledged that it had been reduced from six joints a day to two joints a day\nthrough counselling. He gave counsel an opportunity to respond.[21]He stated the following at para. 14 of his\nReasons for Sentence:[14]\nI raise the issue, as I am familiar with the decision that I recently issued in\nR. v. Graham, 2017 YKTC 29 (CanLII), in Haines Junction. In that case, Mr. Graham had\nentered a guilty plea to having committed an offence contrary to s. 4(1) of the\nControlled Drugs and Substances Act, S.C. 1996, c. 19. He had been charged with\npossession for the purposes of trafficking and ended up pleading to simple\npossession of marijuana.[22]Mr. Graham also indicated in his Pre-Sentence\nReport that he was a daily user of marijuana and would not stop.[23]At para. 15 of his Reasons for Sentence,\nthe trial judge quoted from the Graham case which set out his view of the\npublic interest component of a discharge for Mr. Graham:12\nThe problem that arose for me with respect to the discharge at the original\nsentencing date was that Mr. Graham, quite candidly and quite honestly,\nsaid that he used marijuana daily and that was not going to stop. I was confronted\nwith the difficulty of imposing a conditional discharge with a probation order\non someone who has candidly admitted he is going to be using illegal drugs\nevery day to deal with the issues he had been dealing with . . .13\nIn order to use illegal drugs, one has to buy these drugs from somewhere. Since\nthere is nowhere that can sell them legally except to a person with a medical\nmarijuana exemption, it meant Mr. Graham had to be buying from someone who was\ntrafficking illegally, and he himself becomes part of the trafficking\ntransaction. That, of course, facilitates illegal trafficking on a bigger\nscale. The people trafficking the marijuana that he is purchasing may be doing\nmore — I do not know — and nothing turns on that, but the bottom line is that\nthe public interest remains clear, that the trafficking of illegal drugs in the\nYukon can have a very negative impact on the larger community.14\nThe countervailing point is, of course, the Liberal government's indication at\nthat time [of the original sentencing] that it was going to legalize marijuana\n[at some point in the future,] and the fact that they have moved forward\ntowards doing that. And at some date in the future there is a very good\nlikelihood, given the majority government, that marijuana use and purchase will\nbe legal in certain prescribed amounts and under certain rules and regulations.[24]In Graham, the trial judge adjourned the\nsentencing for four months to permit Mr. Graham to obtain a medical\nmarijuana exemption or “some indication” that his daily usage was not going to\ncontinue.[25]Mr. Graham appeared four months later and his\ncounsel said he had just applied for the medical marijuana exemption. That did\nnot satisfy the trial judge who declined to impose a conditional discharge and\nsentenced Mr. Graham to a fine of $300.[26]In the Reasons for Sentence of Ms. J., the\ntrial judge stated:[21]\nAnd as I said in the Graham sentencing and discussions with counsel, it puts\nthe RCMP in a somewhat difficult situation, because right now the law is that it\nis still illegal. And the RCMP, while they may use discretion in deciding\nwhether they are or are not going to deal with marijuana possession charges at\nthis point in time, are still under a clear legal obligation to investigate and\ncharge where appropriate.[22]\nI still have that problem that a discharge for someone who says that they are\ngoing to continue on a daily basis, which will facilitate trafficking or\ncultivation for possession for the use of marijuana simply is contrary to the\npublic interest. I am not saying that people who do that should necessarily be\ncharged. That is an entirely different issue, and I am sure the RCMP prioritize\nwhat they do, but I think that it sends the wrong message.[23]\nAs such, for the same reasons as in the Graham case, notwithstanding the\ndistinctions, I do not think I can impose a discharge. I think it is contrary\nto the public interest, and that again recognizes the public interest in Ms. [J.]\nnot having a criminal record.[24]\nIn the balancing of them all, I am afraid I feel I must come down on this side.\nThe remorse issue and the issue of the vigilante justice would not in\nthemselves have precluded me from granting a discharge, but when I throw in the\nmarijuana issue, it is a bigger issue for me. I do not find the distinction is\nenough that I could explain what I said in Graham and do something different\nhere.[27]He suspended the passing of sentence and ordered\neight conditions of probation, for a period of six months, the details of which\nare not in issue. There is no condition prohibiting the possession of\nnon-prescription drugs or alcohol.[28]He concluded with the following:[26]\nI have noted the letters that have been provided that are positive in support\nof Ms. [J.], and her involvement in counselling. I accept her apology that she\nhas provided to the Court and note the work that she has been doing with the\nElders in her community. In my opinion, she is a contributing member of her\ncommunity and will continue to be. So this incident is one I do not expect to\nbe repeated.THE CROWN AND DEFENCE SUBMISSIONS[29]At the sentencing hearing, the Crown focussed\nupon the lack of credible remorse. The Crown, on being advised of the judge’s\nview on discharges while continuing to smoke marijuana, found it “interesting” and\nthat it made sense, but it was the remorse issue that was her primary concern.[30]Defence counsel submitted that Ms. J. took\ncounselling after the Pre-Sentence Report, volunteered with the Elders and\nlearned coping mechanisms and better strategies from the counselling. He\ndistinguished Graham as case where the offender was saying that he would\ncontinue to do what he was being sentenced for.[31]At the appeal hearing, the Crown submitted that\nthe sentencing judge committed no error and did not fail to consider a relevant\nfactor. She submitted that the sentence was fit for a mature, once-discharged\noffender who committed an act of violence. It combined both general deterrence\nfor a brazen public assault for which she refused to accept full responsibility\nand candidly admitting that she would not comply with current marijuana laws. She\nsubmitted that granting the discharge would cause the public to lose confidence\nin the administration of justice.[32]Counsel for the appellant notes that the trial\njudge stated he would have granted a conditional discharge were it not for the\nfact that Ms. J. said she smoked marijuana on a daily basis. He argues\nthat the result of this decision is that anyone dealing with a drug addiction\ncannot get a conditional discharge as they are facilitating the trafficking of\ndrugs. He submits that the decision will discourage offenders from making a\nfull and frank disclosure for their pre-sentence reports, which will hinder\nprobation officers from recommending counselling to deal with drug addiction.[33]Counsel for Ms. J. also submits that there\nis no connection between Ms. J.’s consumption of marijuana and the offence.THE LAW OF CONDITIONAL DISCHARGES[34]Section 730(1) of the Criminal Code sets\nout the test to determine whether a conditional discharge is appropriate:730\n(1) Where an accused, other than an organization, pleads guilty to or is found\nguilty of an offence, other than an offence for which a minimum punishment is\nprescribed by law or an offence punishable by imprisonment for fourteen years\nor for life, the court before which the accused appears may, if it considers\nit to be in the best interests of the accused and not contrary to the public\ninterest, instead of convicting the accused, by order direct that the\naccused be discharged absolutely or on the conditions prescribed in a probation\norder made under subsection 731(2). (my emphasis)[35]Section 730(3) states that where the offender\nhas been discharged, the person is deemed not to have committed the offence and\ntherefore has no criminal record.[36]There is a further section of the Criminal\nCode which applies to Aboriginal offenders:718.2(e)\nall available sanctions, other than imprisonment, that are reasonable in the\ncircumstances and consistent with the harm done to victims or to the community\nshould be considered for all offenders, with particular attention to the\ncircumstances of Aboriginal offenders.[37]The case law on conditional discharges has been\naddressed in two decisions of this Court: R. v. MacKenzie, 2013 YKSC 64 (CanLII)\n(“MacKenzie”) and R. v. Martin, 2017 YKSC 61 (CanLII) (“Martin”).\nThese decisions review the case law from R. v. Fallofield (1973), 13\nC.C.C. (2d) 450 (B.C.C.A.); R. v. B.J.M. (1976), 1976 ALTASCAD 6 (CanLII), 3 Alta. L.R. (2d) 341; R.\nv. Shortt, 2002 NWTSC 47 (CanLII) and R. v. Samson, 2015 YKCA 7 (CanLII).[38]Addressing the first part of the test, that the\ncourt considers the conditional discharge to be in the best interests of the\naccused, this is generally met if the accused is a person of good character,\nwithout a criminal record, so that it is not necessary to enter a conviction to\ndeter future offences and recognizing that the entry of a conviction may have\nsignificant adverse repercussions. It is not necessary to identify specific results\nlike the loss of employment but only that the entry of a conviction may have\nsignificant repercussions that create a genuine concern.[39]The second part of the test for a discharge,\nwhether it would be contrary to the public interest to grant the discharge,\nfocusses on whether there is a need for general deterrence of others in the\ncommunity and the need to maintain the public’s confidence in the\nadministration of justice. The courts consider the following:1.the gravity of the offence;2.the prevalence of the offence in\nthe community;3.public attitudes towards the\noffence; and4.public confidence in the\neffective enforcement of the criminal law.[40]In both Shortt and MacKenzie, the\ntrial judges imposed suspended sentences where the offences involved spousal or\ndomestic violence, which they found requires both denunciation and deterrence.ANALYSIS[41]An appeal court may intervene to vary a sentence\nif the court below has committed an error in principle, failed to consider a\nrelevant factor, overemphasized appropriate factors or imposed a sentence that\nis demonstrably unfit. In R. v. Lacasse, 2015 SCC 64 (CanLII), the Court\nclarified that the above principles only justify intervention where the error\nhad an impact on the sentence imposed.[42]As stated in R. v. Ipelee, 2012 SCC 3 (CanLII), at\npara. 38, sentencing judges, despite the constraints of parity, must have\nsufficient manoeuvrability to tailor sentences to the circumstances of the\nparticular offence and the particular offender. LeBel J. specifically addressed\nparity at paras. 78 and 79:78The interaction between ss. 718.2(e) and 718.2(b) - the parity principle -\nmerits specific attention. Section 718.2(b) states that \"a sentence should\nbe similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences\ncommitted in similar circumstances\". Similarity, however, is sometimes an\nelusory concept. As Professor Brodeur describes (\"On the Sentencing of\nAboriginal Offenders: A Reaction to Stenning and Roberts\" (2002), 65 Sask.\nL. Rev. 45, at p. 49):\"...\nhigh unemployment\" has a different meaning in the context of an Aboriginal\nreservation where there are simply no job opportunities and in an urban context\nwhere the White majority exclude Blacks from segments of the labour-market;\n\"substance abuse\" is not the same when it refers to young men smoking\ncrack cocaine and to kids committing suicide by sniffing gasoline;\n\"loneliness\" is not experienced in a similar way in bush reservations\nand urban ghettoes.79In practice, similarity is a matter of degree. No two offenders will come\nbefore the courts with the same background and experiences, having committed\nthe same crime in the exact same circumstances. Section 718.2(b) simply\nrequires that any disparity between sanctions for different offenders be\njustified. To the extent that Gladue will lead to different sanctions for\nAboriginal offenders, those sanctions will be justified based on their unique\ncircumstances - circumstances which are rationally related to the sentencing\nprocess. Courts must ensure that a formalistic approach to parity in sentencing\ndoes not undermine the remedial purpose of s. 718.2(e). …[43]The trial judge correctly identified Ms. J.’s\nAboriginal circumstances, or Gladue factors, based on the drinking,\nabuse and spousal violence in her home as a child, its impact on her and the\ntragic death of her mother. He was satisfied that her remorse for the offence\nwas genuine and she accepted responsibility by her letter and that specific\ndeterrence was not necessary. He concluded that the first part of the discharge\ntest in s. 730(1) had been met and that a discharge was in her best\ninterest.[44]However, in my view, the trial judge erred when\nhe applied his decision in R. v. Graham to conclude that it would be\ncontrary to the public interest to grant a conditional discharge to this\noffender because she disclosed that she smokes marijuana daily to calm herself\ndown. This is particularly so given his acknowledgement that she had reduced her\nusage from six joints a day to two as a result of her counselling for this\noffence. The denial of a conditional discharge in Graham may have been\nappropriate for that particular offence and offender, but it is not appropriate\nfor Ms. J.[45]This is not a case where the trial judge has\nfailed to apply s. 718.2(e) of the Criminal Code and consider Ms. J.’s\nspecial circumstances. Rather, it is a case where what may have been an\nappropriate consideration in the Graham case has been given far too much\nweight in Ms. J.’s circumstances.[46]In my view the fit sentence for Ms. J. must\ntake the following differences from the Graham case into consideration:1.Mr. Graham was charged and pled\nguilty to a drug offence of possession of marijuana, reduced from a charge of\ntrafficking. He had two 8.2-gram bags of marijuana, $350 and a cellphone. Ms. J.’s\noffence of common assault has no connection to the illegal drug industry and\nthe trial judge’s concern about the negative impact it may have on her\ncommunity.2.Ms. J.’s disclosure of\nmarijuana smoking was made to her counsellor and probation officer. It was not\na defiant act which may be an appropriate characterization of Mr. Graham’s statement\nto the court that he was not going to stop smoking marijuana, the precise\noffence before the court. In spite of that, Mr. Graham was offered the\nopportunity of legalizing his marijuana use with a four-month adjournment,\nwhich he did not utilize to address the judge’s clear statement that a\ndischarge was contrary to the public interest in a drug possession case.3.With respect to the sentencing\njudge’s concern about illegal drug trafficking, it is simply not appropriate to\nlay that legitimate community concern on Ms. J., who is not before the\ncourt on a drug charge. It may indeed present a quandary to the RCMP in O[…]\npending the passage of federal legislation permitting possession of marijuana\nin small quantities, but that has little to do with the offence of common\nassault and whether Ms. J. should be conditionally discharged.[47]The sentencing judge, although alive to the\ndifferent circumstances of Mr. Graham and Ms. J., failed to\ndistinguish them. In my view, Ms. J.’s case is distinguishable as there was\nno illegal drug activity in her offence and her disclosure of marijuana smoking\nwas appropriate for her counselling and pre-sentence report and not a\ndisclosure for which she should be penalized in her sentencing. I am of the\nview that it is not in the public interest that the personal possession and use\nof marijuana should result in imposing a criminal record on a 56-year-old First\nNation woman who has taken counselling, apologized, and taken responsibility\nfor her offence[48]Finally, in my view, the “not contrary to the\npublic interest” factor in a conditional discharges refer to whether there is a\nneed for general deterrence and the need to maintain public confidence in the\nadministration of justice. That deterrence relates to the offence of common\nassault and not Ms. J.’s marijuana smoking. I find that a discharge in\nthese circumstances would not affect the public’s confidence in the\nadministration of justice.CONCLUSION[49]I conclude that the trial judge’s decision to\nsuspend the passing of sentence, thereby giving Ms. J. a criminal record,\nresulted in an unfit sentence. I therefore allow the appeal and grant a\nconditional discharge on the same terms as the sentencing judge imposed.___________________________VEALE\nJ."}

Walsh, Q.C.- for Her Majesty the QueenLarry Veniot, Esq.- for the accusedDECISIONRIDEOUT, J.(ORALLY):[1]Alvin Dunphy was charged and plead guilty to the\nfollowing two offences: “Between the 5th day of May, A.D. 2002 and\nthe 23rd day of May, A.D. 2002 at or near the City of Miramichi in\nthe County of Northumberland and Province of New Brunswick, did distribute\nchild pornography, contrary to and in violation of Section 163.1(3)(a) of the\nCriminal Code and amendments thereto” and “Between the 5th day of\nMay, A.D. 2002 and the 23rd day of May, A.D. 2002 at or near the\nCity of Miramichi in the County of Northumberland and Province of New\nBrunswick, did have in his possession child pornography, contrary to Section\n163.1(4)(a) of the Criminal Code of Canada and amendments thereto.”[2]Section 163.1(3)(a) provides: “every person who\nimports, distributes, sell or possesses for the purposes of distribution or sale\nany child pornography is guilty of a) an indictable offence and liable to\nimprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years.”Section 163.1(4)(a)\nprovides: “every person who possesses any child pornography is guilty of an\nindictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five\nyears.”[3]We have heard that Mr. Dunphy is presently 40\nyears of age.The evidence reveals that in the spring of 2002 he was using a\nchat room on the Internet and contacted a person whom he believed to be an adolescent\nbut was in fact a police officer in New Hampshire.As a result of that chat\nroom experience he distributed pornographic child pornography and other\npornographic materials to the police officer.This police officer alerted\nofficials in the Miramichi who paid Mr. Dunphy a visit and it was determined\nthat his computer contained large quantities of child pornography, some 196\npictures and numerous videos and things of that nature.[4]The Court has received a pre-sentence report and\na sex offender assessment.The second report was prepared at the behest of Mr.\nDunphy’s family and was prepared by a Kathleen McKay, who is a resident in\npsychology and a Greg MacDonald, who is a clinical psychologist.The\npre-sentence report dated June 11th, 2003 states: “To our knowledge\nAlvin is appearing in criminal court as a first offender.He appears to be a\ngood candidate for community supervision and has a secure telephone in his\napartment if the Court is considering a conditional sentence order.”We have\nsubsequently learned that Mr. Dunphy is going to be moving back and living with\nhis parents here in the Miramichi.He was previously living in Moncton.The\nsex offender assessment indicates one previous conviction for a sexual\noffence.This occurred in October 1988 when Mr. Dunphy fondled his nephew who\nwas then nine years of age.Mr. Dunphy was charged with a sexual interference\noffence and received two year probation.The sex offender assessment estimates\nMr. Dunphy’s risk to re-offend in a sexual manner to be medium low.The report\nstates at page five: “The level of risk is based on the fact that Mr. Dunphy is\nsingle, has one prior sex offense and has had a male victim.”Also at pages\nsix and seven of the report the author states in their summary and recommendations\nthe following and I’ll read that into the record even though it is somewhat\nlong, at page six:“This is the case of a 40-year old male arrested for\nDistribution of Child Pornography over the Internet.It is his second offense\nhaving been convicted in 1989 for Interference of a Minor.Mr. Dunphy is an amicable individual who appeared\nopen and forthcoming during the assessment process.His intellectual\nfunctioning is in the low average range.He presents as a shy and introverted\nindividual with limited social skills.He is anxious and uncomfortable in\nsocial situations and has few friends or positive influences in his life.Mr. Dunphy’s risk to reoffend in a sexual manner is\nestimated to be moderate.This is based on static factors that reveal that he\nis single, has one prior sex offense and has had a male victim.In addition,\nhis level of risk is also a reflection of dynamic factors that include limited\npositive social influences, relationship instability, general social\nrejection/loneliness, poor cognitive problem-solving skills, sexual\npreoccupation and deviate sexual interests.”They go on in their report to recommend and again I\nquote:“As noted, dynamic factors are amendable to\ntreatment.Given that Mr. Dunphy’s risk to recidivate is estimated to be\nmoderate, it is recommended that he receive individual counseling in order to\nlower his risk to reoffend in a sexual manner.Of particular importance, it is recommended Mr.\nDunphy receive treatment in order to improve his social skills.As noted, a\npositive social network is a protective factor that decreases the risk of\ncriminal behavior.Given Mr. Dunphy’s introverted nature in conjunction with\nhis poor social skills, it is difficult for him to develop positive social\ninfluences.Thus, therapy should be directed towards improving his\nself-confidence, social skills and the development of skills for coping with\neveryday life stressors.It is also recommended that treatment be aimed at\nhelping Mr. Dunphy resolve issues concerning his sexual orientation.As notedMr. Dunphy presents with both confusion regarding his sexual orientation and\ndeviate sexual interests.While he currently identifies himself as a\nhomosexual male, he also admits that he is interested in age appropriate\nfemales but that his shyness prevents him from pursuing a heterosexual\nrelationship.While Mr. Dunphy may indeed be bi-sexual, he presents as a\nlonely individual with a high sex drive who responds sexually to anyone who\ngives him attention.Again, learning appropriate social skills in addition to\nexploring his sexual orientation may help Mr. Dunphy to overcome the barriers\ninfluencing his feelings of loneliness and the self-perception of being\nsocially inept.Moreover, based on Mr. Dunphy’s disclosures, he also appears\nto be sexually attracted to prepubescent males.At present, it is difficult to\nascertain whether or not this attraction is internalized...It is also recommended that treatment explore\nrealistic risk management strategies.These strategies would cover issues\nconcerning the development of a positive social network, relationships and\nintimacy and problem-solving skills.In addition, Mr. Dunphy is currently\ntaking a computer course that involves internet web site design.Given the\nnature of Mr. Dunphy’s current offense, therapy should be directed towards the\nexploration of the appropriateness of this course and the resulting career\npotential it entails.”[5]The fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing are set out in\nsections 718, 718.1 and 718.2 of the Criminal Code.Denunciation of unlawful\nconduct, in this case, possessing and distributing child pornography, is an\nimportant purpose of any sentence for offences of this kind.I am also mindful\nthat section 718.1 requires that sentences must be proportionate to the gravity\nof the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.As well\n718.2 requires that I consider aggravating and mitigating factors in arriving\nat what I consider to be an appropriate sentence.Finally section 718.2(b)\nrequires that a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar\noffenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.[6]We know that Mr. Dunphy has pled guilty and has apologized in court\ntoday.His pleading guilty obviously avoids the necessity of a trial.He has\ncooperated with officials in the preparation of their reports and these I would\nsubmit are mitigating factors.However, some people consider that child\npornography is victimless offence.I and many others do not share that view.The children who are depicted in child pornography are victims and if there was\nless use and distribution of child pornography it would be hoped that there\nwould be less victims.Even defence counsel has said; “he was disgusted by the\ntypes of pornography which he observed” which came from Mr. Dunphy’s computer.I think all members of society want to somehow deter these types of offences\nalthough it is discouraging at times when we realize that tons of this\ninformation is available at a moments notice just by pushing a few keys on a\ncomputer.But it is hoped that if the appropriate sentences are given by the\nCourts that at least they will form some basis for deterrence.[7]I have reviewed a number of cases that have been supplied to me by counsel\nand the range of sentences for these types of offences is quite broad, ranging\nfrom a fine to community detention to periods of incarceration.Most sentences\nof community detention or incarceration are for periods less than two years,\nnormally in the one to two year range.[8]Counsel for Mr. Dunphy has said, Mr. Dunphy has not been doing well in\nhis apartment in Moncton and has decided to move back and be under the\nsupervision of his parents here in Miramichi.As well, it is submitted that\nwhat Mr. Dunphy did was not for a commercial benefit.It was not a production,\nwhich he had hoped to sell.Those factors are taken into consideration.[9]Crown counsel has indicated that there were numerous photographs, 196 I\nbelieve, with videos which depicted various sexual poses and sexual activities\ninvolving adolescent children.There was also an exchange of photos on the\nInternet with the police officer in the United States.These are serious\nmatters and society wants us to denounce these activities.[10]I must confess that my initial reaction in going through the\npre-sentence report and looking at the risk assessment was that a period of\nincarceration is the appropriate sentence in the circumstances of this case.However, many of the authorities which have been recommended to me by counsel\npoint to the need to denounce and deter on the one hand but also to try to find\nmechanisms for rehabilitation and perhaps avoid recidivism with respect to\nthese types of matters.We have had testimony dealing with the types of\nprograms which are available in the prison circumstance, both at the\nWestmorland Institute and at Dorchester Penitentiary and on the other hand we\nhave available here in the Miramichi the person who has prepared the risk\nassessment.We have testimony that the treatments which are contemplated to be\ndone in the community will continue for at least the full sentence and if not\nfor a longer period of time.[11]So I am satisfied that a period of incarceration of 20 months is\nappropriate in the circumstances of this case. I am then required under the\nCode to consider whether a sentence served in the community is appropriate.In\nR. v. Proulx, 2001 S.C.R. 61 at page 93, Lamer, Chief Justice as\nhe then was set out four criteria for imposition of a conditional sentence.The offender must be convicted of an offence that is not punishable by a\nminimum term of imprisonment, and that is the case in this circumstance.The\nCourt must impose a term of imprisonment of less than two years, which I have\njust done.The safety of the community would not be endangered by the offender\nserving the sentence in the community, and a conditional sentence would be\nconsistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing as set out\nin sections 718 to 718.2.[12]I have weighed the issue of the safety of the community and I believe\nthat I can arrange sufficient terms and conditions such that the community\nwould not be endangered by the offender serving the sentence in the community.So for that reason I am going to permit the sentence to be served in the\ncommunity under the following terms and conditions: section 742(3)(1) of the\nCriminal Code provides that the Court shall prescribe as conditions of a\nconditional sentence order that the offender do all of the following: a) keep the\npeace and be of good behaviour; b) appear before the court when required to do\nso by the court; c) report to a supervisor within two working days or such\nlonger period as the court directs after the making of the conditional sentence\norder and thereafter when required by a supervisor in the manner directed by\nthe supervisor; d) remain within the jurisdiction of the court unless written\npermission to go outside the jurisdiction is obtained from the court or the\nsupervisor; and e) notify the court or the supervisor in advance of any change\nof name or address and promptly notify the court or the supervisor of any\nchange of employment or occupation.[13]There are other conditions, which I wish to add.Mr. Dunphy is to\nremain in the residence of his parents, at 459 Ironman Road, Miramichi, at all\ntimes except for the purpose of employment, medical appointments including\ntherapy appointments, religious services, and any legal obligations.Mr.\nDunphy will provide the supervisor with a schedule of work hours, medical and\ntherapy appointments and hours for religious services.Mr. Dunphy is to\nrefrain from using Internet and either must install a device in his computer,\nwhich denies access to the Internet or the computer is not to be equipped with\na modem or any other means of access to the Internet.In addition Mr. Dunphy\nwill permit the supervisor to verify the status of his computer to ensure that\nthese requirements are met.Mr. Dunphy will not associate or hold any\ncommunications directly or indirectly with any persons under the age of 19\nyears.I read into the record the therapy arrangements suggested by Ms. McKay\nand Mr. MacDonald in their Risk Assessment Report and I am ordering, and I\nunderstand that he is agreeable, that Mr. Dunphy receive the treatment which is\noutlined in that report.His failure to do so will result in incarceration for\nthe balance of the term outlined with no release on the basis of good\nbehaviour.As well I order that he continue in the program as directed by Mr.\nMacDonald or Ms. McKay.Mr. Dunphy is to make reasonable efforts to find and\nmaintain employment.I am satisfied as well on the facts of this matter, at\nthe request of the Crown, and the consent of the accused, I should order that\nMr. Dunphy provide a DNA sample in accordance with the Criminal Code.[14]Now finally section 742.3 requires that accused be given a copy of the\norder and an explanation of all of the terms and conditions of sections 742.4\nand 742.6.As this won’t be prepared while I am still here I am going to order\nthat Mr. Dunphy attend before the clerk for explanation. As well his legal\ncounsel will explain to him the terms and conditions of the order once it is\nprepared.[15]Upon completion of the period of house arrest Mr. Dunphy will also be on\nsupervised probation subject to the usual terms and conditions for a period of\nthree years.Additional conditions of probation: Mr. Dunphy will continue to\nrefrain from Internet access.Mr. Dunphy will continue with sex offender\ntreatment if deemed required by the supervisor.[16]Mr. Dunphy I will tell you this that I had a very difficult decision to\nmake in this particular case.We are giving you the benefit of the doubt and\nwe are going to hope that therapy and those types of things can resolve some of\nthe issues that you have and that you can become a productive member of\nsociety.I tell you with all sincerity that if you step out of line one step,\nif you don’t follow the terms and conditions of the order, you will be\nincarcerated for the full length of the terms that is remaining, not one day\nless.Do you understand that Mr. Dunphy?George S. Rideout, J.C.Q.B."}

Flahr, 2009 YKTC 56)Oral Reasons for JudgmentCounsel for the Appellant:J.Van WartCounsel for the Respondent:D.McWhinniePlace and Date of Hearing:Vancouver,British ColumbiaOctober 16, 2009Place and Date of Judgment:Vancouver,British ColumbiaOctober16, 2009[1]GROBERMAN J.A.:Mr. Flahr appeals sentences imposed on him following guilty pleas on\none count of cultivation of marihuana (s. 7 of the Controlled Drugs and\nSubstances Act, S.C. 1996, c. 19) and one count of breach of a bail\ncondition (s. 145(5.1) of the Criminal Code, R.S. 1985, c C-46). He was\nsentenced to 6 months on the cultivation charge, and 30 days concurrent on the\nbreach. Ancillary provisions of the sentence for cultivation included a weapons\nprohibition under s. 109(1) of the Criminal Code and a Victim Fine\nSurcharge of $50. A further Victim Fine Surcharge of $50 was imposed in respect\nof the breach charge. Apparently, it was anticipated that Mr. Flahr would be\nunable to pay the surcharges; rather than waive them, however, the trial judge\nrequired that they be paid forthwith, and provided that if they were not paid,\nthe accused would be imprisoned for 1 day concurrent to his other sentences.[2]Mr. Flahr has now served 32 days of his sentence.\nHe seeks to have the sentence varied to a six month conditional sentence,\nreduced, of course, by the time already spent in custody. The Crown does not\noppose such a disposition, though Crown and Defence do have some difference of\nopinion as to the credit that ought to be granted for time spent in custody.[3]The cultivation offence involved a grow\noperation in which 40 plants in varying stages of maturity and 41 clones were\nfound. In addition, approximately 400 grams of “shake” or low-end quality\nmarihuana were found. Some equipment associated with a grow operation was also\nfound, including lighting and fans. Mr. Flahr stated that the marihuana was\ngrown for his own use. He claimed that the size of the operation was due to the\nfact that he used the marihuana for pain control, and suffered severe pain from\na leg amputation that was not resolving well. He said that he kept the plants\nin varying stages of maturity to ensure a constant supply of the drug. The\nCrown suggested that the size of the operation indicated that more than\npersonal use was likely involved.[4]The breach of bail conditions consisted of a\nfailure to report to a bail supervisor while the accused was on bail in respect\nof an assault charge. When the accused was granted bail, a bail supervisor who\nwas in the courtroom attempted to book an appointment with him, but the accused\nrefused. He did not subsequently report.[5]The accused had an extensive criminal record\nincluding 24 convictions: 10 for theft or attempted theft, 3 for possession of\nstolen property, 3 for mischief, 2 for break and enter, 2 for possession of a\nweapon, and one each for failing to comply with a probation order, assault\ncausing bodily harm, dangerous driving, and driving with over 80 milligrams of\nalcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. Significantly, all but the last-mentioned\nconviction (which occurred in 1997) occurred between 1986 and 1996, and related\nto pre-1995 crimes. In 1995, Mr. Flahr suffered serious injuries in a motor\nvehicle accident, resulting in the amputation of one leg below the knee. This\nappears to have ended his criminal lifestyle.[6]Mr. Flahr was 40 years of age at the time of the\ninitial sentencing hearing, had employment and a good work history. His\namputation was causing him severe pain; the attempt to conserve the knee joint\nhad not worked well, and at the time he came before the court for sentencing,\nhe was scheduled to have a second amputation operation, to shorten the stump to\na point above the knee joint. His doctor indicated that Mr. Flahr was on high\ndoses of narcotics to control the pain, to the point where he was “necessarily\naddicted” to them. He supplemented his narcotic use with marihuana, which he\nfound allowed him to reduce his narcotic intake.[7]The Crown sought a total sentence of 3-4 months,\nplus a weapons prohibition. The accused argued that the appropriate disposition\nwas a fine in the range of $2,000 to $2,500. In the alternative, he sought a\nconditional sentence of imprisonment.[8]The judge adjourned sentencing for several\nmonths, without objection, to allow Mr. Flahr to proceed with his operation and\na period of recovery prior to the imposition of sentence. When sentence was\nimposed, Mr. Flahr had undergone the second operation, which had been a success.\nHis counsel indicated that his pain from his leg was substantially reduced.[9]The judge’s reasons for sentence were very brief.\nAside from a brief discussion of the ancillary terms, the reasons are as\nfollows:[1]This matter was first dealt with\nsome time ago. There were guilty pleas to charges of cultivation of marihuana\nand a breach of undertaking.[2]At the time the matter was\noriginally before the Court, a custodial sentence was clearly warranted based\nupon the prior record of the accused and the nature of the offences,\nparticularly the cultivation offence. It also appeared that an actual custodial\nsentence was, to use the vernacular, \"in the cards\", given the\ndecision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in R. v. Van Santvoord,\n[2007] B.C.J. No. 404.[3]At that particular time, Mr.\nFlahr was scheduled for major surgery and, in consequence, I adjourned sentence\nso that it could be carried out without delay or problem. That has now been\ndone but it is now time, Mr. Flahr, to face the music on this matter.[4]I take account of your\ncontinuing, ongoing medical concerns but, in my view, a custodial sentence is\nstill warranted.[5]With respect to the cultivation\ncharge, I sentence you to a period of imprisonment of six months. On the\nfailing to report charge, 30 days, to be served concurrently.[6]The surcharge is $50 on each\ncount.[7]COUNSEL FOR THE ACCUSED:As I've\nindicated, he's not employed at this time. I wonder if those surcharges could\nbe waived.[8]CROWN COUNSEL:I have no\nsubmissions.[9]THE\nCOURT:I will direct that they be paid forthwith and he can serve the default\nconcurrently.[10]While it is, perhaps, understandable that\nsentencing can become a routine process in a busy Territorial Court, I am of\nthe view that the reasons given are inadequate given the circumstances of the\naccused and the submissions that were made to the court. A judge imposing\nsentence must always be cognizant of his or her duty to explain why a\nparticular disposition is being made. While the reasons may sometimes be brief,\nsome explanation is required.[11]Reasons for sentence serve a variety of\npurposes: they ensure that the accused understands why a particular sentence is\nbeing imposed – this is essential to make the process a fair one, and may also\nbe important to achieving goals of specific deterrence and rehabilitation. The\npublic is also entitled to know why a particular disposition has been ordered. Public\nconfidence in the judicial system depends on the public being able to\nunderstand why particular sentences are imposed. Reasons for sentence also\nserve as guideposts for those who work within the judicial system and for the\ngeneral public. The principle that similar sentences should be given for\nsimilar crimes can only function if courts are able to discern what factors\nmake cases “similar” and “dissimilar”. General deterrence also depends on\npublic understanding of the sentencing process.[12]In the present case, a number of factors meant\nthat the reasons were particularly important: the difference between the\nsubmissions of the Crown and the Defence was the difference between the accused\nlosing his liberty and simply paying a fine; the judge was minded to impose a\npenalty that was significantly more onerous than the Crown sought; the\naccused’s circumstances were unusual; there was some question as to whether the\nsize of the operation was such that it should be treated as a low-level\ncommercial operation or whether it should be treated as non-commercial;\nfinally, the main offence for which sentence was being imposed is one that may\nresult in a wide range of sentences.[13]In light of these various factors, the reasons\nthat were given were, in my view, inadequate. They do not reflect any\nconsideration of whether a conditional sentence was appropriate, nor do they\nexplain what sentencing purposes were found to be most important by the trial\njudge. While I do not suggest that the judge failed to consider the case\ncarefully, his reasons leave the unfortunate impression that he viewed the sentencing\nprocess as a mechanical one.[14]Failure of the sentencing judge to demonstrate\nthat he considered the possibility of a conditional sentence of imprisonment\nis, in my view, an error of principle in this case. The judge appears to have\ntreated R. v.Van Santvoord, 2007 BCCA 23 (CanLII) as the authority guiding his\nsentencing discretion in this case. That case, however, was not similar to the\ncase we are dealing with in material respects. The guidance provided by the\nBritish Columbia Court of Appeal in its decision in R. v. Koenders, 2007\nBCCA 378 (CanLII) would have been more apt.[15]In view of the agreement of the Crown and Defence\nas to the proper disposition of the appeal, I would allow the appeal on the\nsentence imposed on the cultivation offence. I would substitute for the 6 month\nsentence of imprisonment a 6 month conditional sentence, which commenced on the\ndate of the sentencing, subject to the suspension during the bail period in\naccordance with s. 719 of the Criminal Code, on the following terms,\nwhich have been agreed to by the Crown and Defence:1.Keep\nthe peace and be of good behaviour;2.Appear\nbefore the Territorial Court when required to do so by that court;3.Report\nto a supervisor within seven working days after the making of this order and\nthereafter report in a manner and when required by the supervisor;4.Remain\nwithin the jurisdiction of the Territorial Court unless written permission to\ngo outside the jurisdiction is given by that court or by the supervisor;5.Notify\nthe court or supervisor in advance of any change in name or address and\npromptly notify the Territorial Court or supervisor of any change in\nemployment;6.Abide\nby a curfew within his place of residence between the hours of 4:00 p.m. and\n10:00 a.m. daily except with the prior written permission of the conditional\nsentence supervisor, except for employment or work purposes, for educational\npurposes, for attendance at family or cultural events, for religious purposes,\nfor emergency medical or dental treatments, and for any other purpose that the\nsupervisor feels is rehabilitative. Mr. Flahr must present himself at the door\nor answer the telephone during reasonable hours for curfew checks.7.Not\nconsume or possess any controlled substance within the meaning of the Controlled\nDrugs and Substances Act except as prescribed by a qualified medical\npractitioner;8.Abstain\nfrom the purchase, possession or consumption of alcohol or other intoxicating\nsubstances;9.Not possess\nany fertilizer, hydroponic equipment or other equipment particularly suited for\nuse in growing cannabis.[16]I would maintain the firearms prohibitions\nimposed by the judge under s. 109(1) of the Criminal Code. In view\nof Mr. Flahr’s financial circumstances at the time that sentence was imposed,\nit was proper to exempt him from the Victim Fine Surcharge under s. 737(5) of\nthe Criminal Code. During the period he was recovering from his\noperation, being fitted for a prosthesis and restoring his ability to walk, it\nwould have been a hardship for him to pay the fine. Exempting him from it would\nhave been proper – in my view, the judge’s imposition of a concurrent 1 day\nsentence for anticipated non-payment was a subterfuge. I would substitute an\norder under s. 737(5) of the Criminal Code exempting Mr. Flahr from the\nsurcharge.[17]The sentence on the breach of bail condition has\nalready been served. No argument has been directed to it on this appeal, and no\npurpose would be served by modifying it on this appeal. I would not, in the\ncircumstances, accede to any modification of it, nor would I give additional\ncredit for the time served in respect of the conditional sentence beyond\nacknowledging that it commenced on the date of sentencing.[18]DONALD J.A.:I\nam in agreement with Mr. Justice Groberman’s reasons.[19]HUDDART J.A.:I\nagree.[20]DONALD J.A.:The\nappeal is allowed on the terms indicated by Mr. Justice Groberman.

These needn’t be repeated. I found the sentence imposed on the\naccused to be inappropriate. It involved the suspension of the passing of sentence\nand placing the defendant on probation conditions, one of which required him to\nmake restitution to the victims of his unfair practices.[3]The request of Crown counsel to me on this POA\nsentence appeal was for 15 months imprisonment, a stand alone order of\nrestitution, and a probation order for two years with a condition of reporting\nto a probation officer. I agreed that imprisonment was appropriate and\nsentenced the defendant to an aggregate of seven months. I declined to make a\nprobation order.[4]I expressed an reluctance to make a stand\nalone order of restitution mainly because I was unsure of my authority to do\nso.I invited both Crown counsel and the defendant to make additional\nsubmissions on this point. I entertained additional oral argument and agreed to\ndefer my decision pending receipt of some case authorities, and any additional\nwritten submissions that the parties wished to make. I have now received these\nfrom Crown counsel. The defendant who was anxious to serve the custodial\nportion of his sentence and is currently incarcerated, did not make any\nadditional submissions.[5]In the supplementary written submissions of\nthe counsel for the Crown is a brief statement that a compensation order is a\ncreature of the Criminal Code and does not apply to provincial offences. I\ninfer from this that Crown counsel has abandoned the request for a stand alone\norder of restitution. If so, I agree with his new position. There is no\nstatutory authority under the Business Practices Act, nor under the Provincial\nOffences Act, to make a stand alone order of either restitution or\ncompensation.[6]This was an obvious deficiency in a statute\nthat deals with offences which typically involved economic loss to victims. I\nnote that the Business Practices Act has been repealed in its entirety\nvery recently and has been replaced by provisions in the Consumer Protection\nAct, which not only doubles the maximum sentence available on conviction[2] but also addresses the\nnon-availability of both a restitution order and a compensation order.[3] Had the defendant been charged\nunder this new statute, there would be no problem in imposing a stand alone\norder of restitution. But he was charged under the Business Practices Act\nwhich continues to apply to this case, even in this appeal.[4] The repeal and the new specific\nprovision for restitution, however, highlight by contrast the non-availability\nof this sanction in the BPA.[7]The argument now advanced by counsel for the\nCrown in his primary argument is that this court should impose by way of\nsentence, in addition to the imprisonment already ordered, a two year probation\norder with its major feature being a term of restitution to all of the victims\nof the defendant’s unfair practices.[8]The issues are reduced to two.(1)Can a probation order with a restitution\ncondition be imposed?(2)Should a probation order with a restitution\ncondition be imposed?[9]The prosecutions concedes that the only\nsanctions available under the BPA are a fine or imprisonment or both. It\nis under the Provincial Offences Act, specifically section 72(1)(b),\nthat the court can place a defendant convicted of an offence “in a\nproceeding commenced by information” on probation in addition to fining or\nsentencing the defendant to imprisonment. It is on section 72(1)(b) of the Provincial\nOffences Act that the Crown counsel relies for the imposition of a sentence\nof probation on the defendant.[10]I agree with him that probation is an\navailable sentence in this case. It was started by information. My sentence\ndoes involve imprisonment. The defendant has been convicted. All of the\npre-requisites are present and qualify the defendant for this additional\nsentence.[11]The more difficult determination is whether\nthis defendant should be placed on probation and, in particular, with a\nprobation condition of restitution to his victims. This determination involves\na number of considerations.[12]Firstly, the probation order can have a\nmaximum duration of two years[5]\nfrom the date it takes effect. In this case, any probation order I might make\nwould take effect on the expiration of the defendant’s term of imprisonment.[6][13]Secondly, the making of a probation order is\ndiscretionary, not automatic, and the court has to have regard to the age,\ncharacter and background of the defendant, and to the nature of and the\ncircumstances surrounding the offences.[14]Thirdly, a probation order made under\nsection 72(1)(b) POA necessarily has three statutory conditions.[7] However, it may have optional\nconditions as well. These optional conditions are in the discretion of the\ncourt and the authority to impose such conditions is in section 72(3) POA.[8][15]Section 72(3) POA has four\nsub-paragraphs, listed disjunctively, which provide some choices for conditions\nthat can be prescribed in a probation order made under section 72(1) POA.\nIn this case, subparagraphs (b) and (d) do not apply as conditions sought by\nthe prosecution. While these might be available, there is no request for\neither. This leaves conditions of probation that might be imposed pursuant to\nsection 72(3)(a) and/or section 72(3)(c).[16]Fourthly, this court has to bear in mind the\nprovisions of section 75 POA which deals with breaches of conditions of\nprobation orders made under the POA, and, in particular the penalty\nprovisions for such breaches.[9][17]Counsel for the Crown has brought to my\nattention two quite recent decisions on which he relies, both unreported to\ndate.[18]R. v. Gnish et al[10] involved the sentencing of the defendants, a husband and wife, and\ntheir credit counselling corporation, on an offence of failing to register\npursuant to the Collection Agencies Act. After fining the corporation\n$1000, Knazen J. placed the husband and wife on probation for two years under\nthe POA with the statutory conditions and, on the husband, he added an\noptional condition, namely, that he make restitution in the amount of $1200\nwithin six months.[19]It is apparent from this decision that the\nrestitution condition was being imposed pursuant to section 72(3)(c) POA.\nIt is also quite clear that this particular condition of restitution was\n“representative” only. By this, I mean that there were multiple victims with\nmany losses in the case, but the court chose to order restitution to one victim\nonly rather than ordering “full restitution”. The intention expressed was:“to show … that any violation in the future …\ncould result in full restitution being ordered”.The presiding justice\nwas“notpersuaded that ordering restitution in\nthe full amount will contribute to the defendant’s rehabilitation any more than\nthe trial, the conviction and the terms imposed already has.”[20]My inference from this decision is that the\ncourt connected the restitution condition to the circumstances of the offence\nand the defendants and intended to convey a message to the defendants that more\nonerous consequences would result from any recurrence of such offences, the\nobvious targets being prevention of similar conduct and rehabilitation of the offenders.[21]R. v. Senchak[11] involved a charge of breach of probation under section 75 POA.\nThe defendant had been charged with an unfair practice offence under the Business\nPractices Act. He was placed on probation on a consent appeal relating to\nthat offence, with a condition of restitution. He was also fined. He failed to\nmake the restitution. He also did not pay the fine. This decision is not\nparticularly helpful except that it suggests that, as a term of probation\nimposed under section 72 POA following a conviction of an unfair\npractice, the court can require restitution. The conclusion to be drawn is that\nthe presiding justice relied for his authority to do so on section 72(3)(a) POA.\nThe restitution ordered in this case was $3000. The transcript does not\ndocument what happened on the breach of probation charge. The case was put over\nto another date presumably on the expectation that the defendant would, in the\ninterim, pay his victim and pay his fine.[22]My decision, in this case, is to decline to\norder the defendant to make restitution to his victims. I decline to do so in a\nstand alone order of restitution because there exists no authority for me to do\nso. I decline to do so as a condition of probation for the following reasons.[23]First, and foremost, this disposition is a\nstretch to a length I am not prepared to go. The offence-creating statute, the Business\nPractices Act, contains a penalty section specifically for the offence of\nan unfair practice. This involves fine or imprisonment or both. It would have\nbeen very simple to include probation and restitution in the sanctions\navailable for this offence in the BPA. Their absence is\nconspicuous. While probation is clearly an available sentence, it is equally\nclearly an additional sentence to the primary choices set out in the BPA,\nand one that is more generic in its application. Probation is not restricted to\nBPA offences; it applies to any provincial offence where the proceeding\nis started by information.[24]To impose probation in addition to\nimprisonment, there needs to be some purpose to the probation. In the unique\ncircumstances of this case, there is little doubt in my mind that the only\npurpose for imposing a probation order at this time is to provide a vehicle to\ncarry the restitution condition sought by the Crown. There is no other way to\neffect restitution in this case.[25]Section 72(3) POA sets out four\noptions available as terms or conditions of a probation order. The first\npermits the court, in its discretion, to order“that the defendant satisfy any compensation or\nrestitution that is required or authorized by an Act”.What this is, in my\nreading, is a clear and unambiguous choice that deals specifically with\nrestitution as a condition of a probation order. However, it is not an unlimited\nchoice: it does not give the court imposing sentence carte blanche in\nthe restitution condition it selects. In fact, the restitution included as a\ncondition of probation must be a restitution that is required by an Act or\nauthorized by an Act. By “required”, I infer that restitution is a mandatory or\na minimum sentence for the offence involved. By “authorized”, I infer that\nthere is some specific statutory reference in an “Act” that makes restitution a\npotential sentencing disposition.[26]In this case, the BPA neither\nrequires nor authorizes restitution. Nor does any other “Act” that applies to\nthe offences in this case. I cannot determine what requirement or authorization\nin what “Act” the court relied upon in R. v. Senchak in making a\nprobation order with a restitution condition. In fact, it is not certain if the\ncourt in that case actually did act under section 72(3)(a). It merely stated\nthat section 72(3)(a) did apply but did not say why it did apply.[27]Accordingly, I cannot utilize paragraph (a)\nof section 72(3) POA to include a restitution condition in the case\nbefore me. This leaves paragraph (c) of section 72(3) POA as a possible\nauthority to include a condition of restitution.[28]However, paragraph (c) presents some\ndifficulties as well. The probation conditions permissible under this paragraph\nare not specified. This paragraph is what is sometimes called a “catch all”\nclause,[12]\nlegal jargon for wide and unspecified choices of conditions of probation allowed\nto the court. It was under section 72(3)(c) that the restitution condition was\nincluded in the probation order in R. v. Gnish. What was not addressed\nin that case, and what troubles me in the present case, is the presence of\nsection 72(3)(a) POA. I have considerable difficulty in by-passing a\nspecific provision that gives me a choice, albeit restricted, of restitution,\nin favour of a non-specific provision that is so general that it has virtually\nno restrictions at all. Using the catch all is tantamount to doing an end run\naround legislation that constrains sentencing options. I have to assume that\nthese constraints were included for some purpose. Resortingto section\n72(3)(c) is part of the stretch I cannot bring myself to make in this case.[29]Secondly, and to back up a step, I am very\nreluctant to place this particular defendant on probation at all, much less\nwith a restitution condition. The context of the case before me is unusual but\nvery relevant. Chronologically, this case will soon be five years old. The\nfirst court appearance was in March 2001. The sentencing took place in January\n2003, almost two years later. The defendant was placed on probation for two\nyears until January 2005. It is now January 2006. His probation term ended over\na year ago. There is no evidence that he actually breached[13] any of the probation\nconditions of his probation order, except the condition of restitution. Other\nconditions included reporting to his probation officer under whose supervision\nhe remained for the full two years, performance of 50 hours of community service\nwork, and writing letters of apology to all victims of his thirteen unfair\npractices offences.There was no representation by the prosecution that he did\nnot complete these.[30]For what, if anything, does this two years\non probation count? To ignore it is as unfair, in a lesser context, as ignoring\nten years of penitentiary time spent by someone who is later exonerated by new\nDNA evidence. In addition to fairness considerations, there is also the problem\nof section 72(4) POA which creates a maximum two year duration for POA\nprobation orders. Technically, the defendant’s probation order had expired on\nJanuary 13, 2005, some six months before my decision on sentence appeal was\nreleased (July 15, 2005). While an appellate court can vary a sentence, it must\ndo so“… within the limits prescribed by law …”[14]Placing the defendant\non probation for another two years would mean he would spend four years on\nprobation, double the maximum that is permitted as the duration of a POA probation\nterm. I do not believe this is “within the limits prescribed by law”.[31]Thirdly, in making a probation at all, even\non a sentence appeal, the court is required to consider the age, character,\nbackground of the defendant, the nature of the offence and the circumstances\nsurrounding its commission.[15]\nThe nature of the offences and the circumstances in which they were committed,\nin particular the age and vulnerability of the victims unquestionably favour\nsupervision for some period of time in the form of a probation order, and if\npossible, with some repayment of victims’ losses.[32]However, the background of the defendant is\nto be included in this consideration. In this case, and on this appeal, all of\nthe factual considerations mentioned in paragraph [28] and paragraph [37] of my\nprior Reasons continue to apply, namely, that the defendant has lost virtually\neverything, he has gone bankrupt, his life is a mess, he attempted suicide, he\nhas suffered loss of income, reputation and health, and was reduced to living\non disability benefits. To these must be added two additional and very\nsignificant facts. One is that he has spent two years on probation. The second\nis that he is serving a sentence of seven months of incarceration.[33]My feeling is that additional probation\nwould be overkill in this case. Seven months of deprivation of liberty is not\ninsignificant and serves the primary objectives of deterrence and denunciation\nas well as contributing to rehabilitation. What the justice system has not\nimposed is consequences for his offences, divine retribution appears to have.[34]Fourthly, I have to question the why\nbehind the probation order sought by the Crown. The purpose is primarily, and\nat this point, only, to create a judicial obligation on the defendant to make\ngood the losses suffered by the victims of his offences. That obligation would\npersist for a period of two years only, as it is necessarily tied to the\nmaximum duration of a probation order. It might be extended for an additional\nyear should the restitution not be made and should the defendant be charged and\nconvicted of a breach of probation.[16][35]Is it realistic to expect restitution to be\nmade by this defendant? I don’t think so. He will be a recipient of disability\nbenefits when he is released from custody. He has gone bankrupt. Presumably\nwhat he managed to accumulate is all gone. He is likely not going to return to\nthe home renovation business, at least in this community. He now has a record\nalthough one for provincial offences. There has to be a realistic expectation\nthat probation conditions will be complied with during the term of the\nprobation order. There is little to none here. In R. v. Gnish and R.\nv. Senchak, the restitution amounts were modest, $1,200 and $3,130 respectively.\nIn this case, the losses exceeded $70,000. This defendant does not have the\nmeans, or the reasonable likelihood of acquiring the means to make any\nsignificant restitution. And he ought not be set up for an almost certain\nfailure to comply.[36]Finally, there are reasons that are more\nperipheral in nature but which militate against the probation cum\nrestitution that is being sought. On nine of the thirteen offences of which\nthis defendant was found guilty, his co-accused was also convicted. Not only\nwas the co-accused sentenced to imprisonment, he was also placed on probation\nwith a condition of restitution to the victims of his nine offences of specific\ndollar amounts that represented approximately half of the total losses of his\nindividual victims.[17][37]It is clear from the facts admitted by the\ndefendant in this case, and from the findings at trial in the case of the\nco-accused, that these two individuals were involved in a common business\nthrough which they engaged in their unfair practices. However, the participation\nof each of these miscreants was not equal in the offences for which they share\na conviction, and obviously not so for other offences of which they were\nconvicted individually. While culpability for a particular offence is shared\nequally, the degree of culpability isn’t necessarily so. There really is no way\nto allocate degree of culpability between these two individuals. Moreover,\nthere is no evidence as to who received what portion of the monies they\nobtained from their individual victims.[38]In the evidence in this case on which the\nsentence appeal is brought, it was conceded that of the thirteen victims of the\ndefendant, eleven received some repayment via distributions to creditors by the\nbankruptcy trustee, approximately 14 cents on the dollar for each claim made.\nThere is no reconciliation in the evidence of the amounts of the claims in\nbankruptcy of these eleven victims, whether these claim amounts are the same as\nthe amounts read into evidence and acknowledged by the defendant in this case,\nand whether these claim amounts coincide with the amounts found to represent the\nlosses of the nine victims that the co-accused had in common with the defendant\nin this case. There is no evidence as to which two victims did not make claims\nin the bankruptcy at all, and whether these two were or were not victims in\ncommon to both of these two villains. The evidence in this case also\nestablished that for some of these victims, some home renovations were done or\npartially done. There was unsatisfactory evidence of the amount of work done\nand for whom, and no evidence of the value of any work that was actually done.[39]While this court has great sympathy for the\nvictims of the defendant, the primary function of this court is not to redress\nthe wrongs or the losses sustained by one member of the community as a result\nof conduct of another. That is more the province of courts of civil\njurisdiction which are much more suited to determining matters of compensation\nand restitution, determining quantum, and allocating liabilities. This\nproceeding is, in fact, one step removed from the trial court and does not even\nhave the advantage of having heard any of the evidence; this court is dealing\nwith an appeal against sentence.[40]For all of these reasons, I decline to place\nthe defendant on probation, and consequently, there will be no order of\nrestitution. The victims will have to seek redress in the civil courts where\nthey will have access to all of the legal machinery to collect and enforce any\njudgment awarded. As for the defendant, his time behind bars represents a\nmeasured response that will hopefully result in no further offending.Released:January 31, 2006Signed: “Justice John\nKukurin”[1] Since reported as R. v.

and(f)to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgement\nof the harm done to victims and to the community.[12]Section 718.1 provides that a sentence be proportionate to the gravity\nof the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.Section 718.2\nsets out other sentencing principles that a court is required to consider.Under this section a court needs to consider any aggravating or mitigating\ncircumstances relating to the offence or the offender.In addition, a sentence\nshould be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar\noffences committed in similar circumstances.Position\nof the Crown and the Defendant[13]The Crown argues that specific deterrence is a significant factor in\nthis case.They point to the fact that the victim was not seeking a physical\nconfrontation.Mr. Bonnington, however, persevered, waded through the water to\nMr. Gibbon’s boat, and insisted on getting up on the back of the boat to hit\nMr. Gibbons.The Crown points to Mr. Bonnington’s extensive criminal record\nand the fact that he has been convicted of an assault in the past.The Crown\nseeks an order that Mr. Bonnington be incarcerated for 18 months, followed by\ntwo years’ probation.[14]Mr. Bonnington accepts that a period of incarceration is required in\nthis case.It is submitted that while denunciation and general deterrence are\nrelevant considerations, specific deterrence should not be a concern for the\ncourt.The defence points out that Mr. Bonnington has close ties with his\nfamily.He has been the driving force behind his business and a long period of\nincarceration will likely result in the closure of his business and the loss of\njobs in the community.The defence submits that an intermittent sentence of 90\ndays would be appropriate in the circumstances of this case.With respect to\nprobation, the defence has proposed a period of one year probation after\ncompletion of the sentence.Case Law[15]It is apparent that there are a broad range of sentences which have been\nimposed by the courts for convictions of aggravated assault.This reflects the\nwide range of circumstances covered under this section.[16]In support of their position that an intermittent sentence is appropriate,\nthe defence relies upon three cases.In R. v. Smart, 2013 ONSC 600 (CanLII), the\ncourt dealt with an incident where the two defendants picked a fight with the\ncomplainant.One of the defendants held the complainant while the other\npunched him.The complainant suffered two fractures to his jaw and was left\nwith permanent scarring.It is significant to note in that case that both of\nthe offenders were relatively young.One was 24 at the time of the assault,\nand the other was 26.One of the accused had a criminal record, but with no\ncrimes of violence.The other was a first-time offender.The attack on the\ncomplainant was found by the court to be an aberrant act which was out of\ncharacter for both of the defendants.In that case, the court found the appropriate\ndisposition for each of the offenders to be a 90-day intermittent sentence.Rehabilitation was considered an important component of the sentence, and the\ncourt was satisfied that the objective of specific deterrence did not require a\nlonger sentence.[17]In R. v. Pulido, 2010 ONSC 3143 (CanLii) (CanLII) the court also imposed\nan intermittent sentence of 90 days.There had been a previous conviction\nabout 10 years previously.In that case the defendant conceded liability for\nthe hand injury, which proved to be the sole basis upon which he was convicted.[18]The defence also referred to the decision in R. v. Farrah, 2006\nCarswellONT 6729.In that case the defendant pleaded guilty.The court also\nnoted that the accused was a young man with a positive future.Having regard\nto the age and character of the accused, the nature of the offence and the\ncircumstances, an intermittent sentence was considered appropriate.[19]The Crown relied on two authorities.In R. v. McCalla, [2000]\nOJ. 399, the Ontario Court of Appeal upheld a sentence of 15 months plus three\nyears probation on a first-time offender.The offence arose out of an incident\ninvolving “road rage”.The appellant followed the complainant and then slashed\nthe victim’s face with an exacto knife.Deterrence was an important component\nfor this sentence.[20]The Crown also referred to R. v. Hassad, [2013] AJ No. 379, a\ndecision of the Alberta Court of Queen’s Bench.That case also involved a\nmotor vehicle situation where angry words were exchanged.The accused drew a\nknife and slashed the complainant once across the face.The court imposed a\nsentence of 10 months incarceration, followed by 24 months probation.Mitigating\nand Aggravating Factors[21]In considering an appropriate sentence I have considered the following\nmitigating factors:(1)No weapon was used by the defendant in the commission of the offence.(2)Only one person was involved in the offence.The defendant did not\nenlist the aid of any others to participate in the assault.(3)The incident itself was relatively brief and consisted primarily of one\nswing towards the complainant’s face.(4)The attack in this case was not planned or premeditated.(5)The defendant had been subjected to verbal abuse prior to the incident\nby the complainant and by other members who were on the same boat as the\ncomplainant.(6)As noted in the pre-sentence report, the defendant was able to express\nvictim empathy and in his own statement to the court expressed regret about the\ninjury suffered by the complainant.[22]Some of the aggravating factors in this case are as follows:(1)The most serious aggravating factor is the nature of the injury suffered\nby the complainant.The loss of the vision in his eye represents a serious and\npermanent injury.(2)Although not recent, the defendant does have a lengthy criminal record,\nand on at least one previous occasion was convicted of assault.(3)The incident demonstrated a total loss of self control by the defendant.His actions in climbing onto the back of the complainant’s boat clearly\ndemonstrated his intention to have a physical confrontation.Analysis\nand Decision[23]In reviewing the available case law submitted by counsel I have\nconcluded that intermittent sentences for a conviction of aggravated assault\nare available only in very limited circumstances.[24]They would apply, for example, to a first offender convicted of\naggravated assault who has an otherwise unblemished record.Younger offenders\nhave also been granted intermittent sentences where there is strong evidence\nfor successful rehabilitation.I am of the view that an intermittent sentence\nis not appropriate in this case.Mr. Bonnington does not fit into the\ncharacterization of a youthful offender with strong evidence of\nrehabilitation.His past criminal record, although he has had no convictions\nsince 2006, does not support an intermittent sentence, which would be at the\nlowest end of the range.[25]At the time of the offence Mr. Bonnington was a mature adult.When he\nleft his own boat he had the option of entering open water and leaving.Instead, he lost control of his temper and went over to the Mr. Gibbons’ boat\nwhere he intended to have, and did have, a physical confrontation.Society\ncannot tolerate physical aggression in the context of disagreements between\npeople as to how someone else might be driving their boat or motor vehicle.Denunciation and general deterrence are significant factors which must be\nrecognized for the sentence in this case.[26]Also significant is the nature of the injury suffered by Mr. Gibbons,\nwhich is a serious and permanent injury.[27]The mitigating factors noted above are, however, important.In my view,\nthe mitigating factors take this case below the range proposed by the Crown.I\nam satisfied that Mr. Bonnington genuinely regrets the injury to Mr. Gibbons.My conclusion that the incident was not premeditated and that there was no\nweapon used are also, in my view, very significant mitigating factors.[28]I have concluded that, in the circumstances of this case, the\nappropriate sentence is incarceration for nine months, plus a period of two\nyears probation.The terms of the probation are the statutory terms and, in\naddition:(1)report\nimmediately to a probation officer and thereafter as required;(2)have\nno contact, direct or indirect, with David Gibbons; and(3)attend\ncounselling for anger management issues as directed by the probation officer\nand sign any releases as requested.[29]As aggravated assault contrary to section 268 of the Criminal Code\nis a primary designated offence, a DNA order under section 487.051 is\nmandatory.In addition, a 10-year weapons ban under section 109 of the Criminal\nCode is also mandatory.I order that these orders be issued in accordance\nwith those sections of the Criminal Code.Justice M. McKelveyReleased:October 11, 2013"}

Mr.\n[M.L.W.] said he did not have one.The officer said Mr. [M.L.W.] had blood\nshot eyes, and was slow and unsteady on his feet.Following a breath demand,\nMr. [M.L.W.] provided breath samples of 150 and 130.III.CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE\nOFFENDER[5]Mr. [M.L.W.] is\nforty-four years of age and was recently married to [D.W.].He currently\nresides in Regina with his wife and an\ninfant child.[6]Mr. [M.L.W.] appeared\nwith lawyer Carmen Gattinger in court in Melville on May 5, 2004.On that\ndate, Ms. Gattinger advised the Court that Mr. [M.L.W.] had been the victim of\nresidential school abuse as a young person.She said the incident on May 11, 2003 occurred shortly after\nMr. [M.L.W.] testified at his residential school trial.The abuse alleged\noccurred between 1966 and 1971, while Mr. [M.L.W.] was aged six to eleven\nyears.His residential school law suit included a claim for sexual abuse.[7]Mr. [M.L.W.] filed\nwith the Court a letter from his lawyer Tony Merchant.Mr. Merchant confirmed\nhis representation of Mr. [M.L.W.] in this residential school litigation.[8]Further, Mr. [M.L.W.]\nfiled with the Court a letter from Dr. Peter Saunders of Fort Qu’Appelle.Dr. Saunders\nsummarized Mr. [M.L.W.]’s situation as follows:[M.L.W.] has been a patient of mine since\nMay of 2001.Over the last three years I have seen him regularly on a\nprofessional basis and have come to have some understanding of the long-term\neffect on his health that has resulted from the abuse that he sustained while\nattending residential school as a child.As a result of the post-traumatic stress\ndisorder that [M.L.W.] suffered as a young man, he experienced periods of drug\nand alcohol abuse.In the mid 1990's [M.L.W.] turned his life around and at\nthis point in his life his misuse of drugs and alcohol ceased.Unfortunately however when he started to\nseek legal compensation for the abuse that he suffered as a child many of the\nold unresolved issues resurfaced and [M.L.W.] started to abuse alcohol again.[M.L.W.]’s last abusive use of alcohol was in May 2003 at a time when he was\nagain going through court issues related to his lawsuit against the Federal\ngovernment.Since then [M.L.W.] has managed to maintain\nabstinence from both drugs and alcohol however he realized that he still has\nissues to deal with in this regard and is planning to admit himself to Pine\nLodge in June and July of this year as part of a refresher course related to\nhis past alcohol and drug abuse.[M.L.W.] has good insight into the\npost-traumatic stress disorder that he suffers as a result of the prior abuse.He realizes that drugs and alcohol are a fault[y] coping mechanism that he has\ndeveloped to try and deal with the emotional stress he still experiences.He\nis making sincere efforts to get on with his life and to take responsibility\nfor his physical and emotional well being.[9]As referred to by Dr.\nSaunders, inpatient alcohol treatment was arranged for Mr. [M.L.W.].A letter\nfrom Gail Guest, program secretary at Pine Lodge in Indian Head, confirmed his\nplacementfor inpatient treatment from June 30 to July 28, 2004.It addition, Mr.\n[M.L.W.] has attendedAlcoholics Anonymous from time to time, and has remained\nsober since these offences occurred in May, 2003.[10]Mr. [M.L.W.] was\nemployed at the New Democratic Party Call Centre in Regina from fall 2003 until the end of June\n2004. He has been accepted by the Saskatchewan Indian Institute of Technology\ninto its Information Technology course beginning August 16, 2004 and ending May 27, 2005.The pre-sentence report\nindicates that, upon successful completion of his first year in this course,\nMr. [M.L.W.] will automatically be granted a seat for year two. During these\nstudies, he will receive funding through the First Nations Employment Centre.\nMr. [M.L.W.]’s acceptance and placement in this course was confirmed by a\nletter from Brenda Fiddler, Abilities Counsellor with the First Nations\nEmployment Centre.[11]Mr. [M.L.W.] is a\nTreaty Status Indian, and a band member at M. First Nation.A letter from\nChief Shirley Wolfe Keller stated the support of this band for Mr. [M.L.W.].Among other things Chief Wolfe Keller’s letter indicates Mr. [M.L.W.] has\nparticipated in cultural events, and will be seeking and utilizing elders for\nadvice and moral support and counselling.[12]Mr. [M.L.W.] has a\nlengthy criminal record commencing in 1980.Over the next sixteen year period\nuntil 1996, he had eleven convictions for drinking and driving, which resulted\nin fines and periods of incarceration.Over this period, he also has other\nconvictions including false pretenses, fraud, unlawful use of a credit card,\nbreak and enter, impersonation with intent, drive while disqualified, failing\nto stop at the scene of an accident and breach of probation.Since 1996, he\nhas no further conviction for a drinking and driving offence.The last entry\non his record is a driving while disqualified charge in 1999.IV.CROWN POSITION[13]The Crown submits\nthat Mr. [M.L.W.] is a repeat offender in the area of drinking and driving.Given his past convictions for drinking and driving, the Crown submits that a\nperiod of imprisonment of less than three years but more than one year is\nappropriate.The prosecutor indicated that two years imprisonment “might be\nappropriate”.[14]In support of their\nposition, the Crown filed the cases of R. v. Bear 1994 CanLII 4609 (SK CA), [1994] S.J. 272 (Sask.\nC. A.), R. v. Kakakaway, [1998] S.J. 638 (Sask. C. A.) and R v.\nWhitehead, (1998), 1998 CanLII 12375 (SK CA), 168 Sask. R. 314 (Sask. C. A.). These cases all\nreinforce the view that protection of the public through incarceration is the\nparamount sentencing consideration for offenders who continue to drink and\ndrive.V.DEFENCE POSITION[15]Mr. [M.L.W.]’s\nposition, initially advocated by Ms. Gattinger, and then continued in person by\nMr. [M.L.W.], is to seek a conditional sentence of imprisonment pursuant to\nsection 742.1 of the Criminal Code.By implication, the defence\nposition is that Mr. [M.L.W.] would not endanger the safety of the community by\nserving a conditional sentence and further, that such a sentence would be\nconsistent with the purpose and principles of sentencing. In particular the\nprinciple in section 718.2(e) is key to the defence position, requiring the\ncourt to consider “all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are\nreasonable in the circumstances ... for all offenders, with particular\nattention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.”[16]The defence notes\nMr. [M.L.W.] had a substantial length of sobriety from 1997 until 2003. As a\nresult of his residential school claim litigation, and the trauma which this\ncreated in him, he began drinking again not long before this .08 charge arose.\nHe continues to suffer from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, but has remained\nsober since committing this offence. He has considerable and ongoing\nprofessional support respecting treatment in the areas of addictions and\ntrauma, as well as support from members of his family and his community.VI.APPLICATION OF\nCURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES TO LAW[17]In my view, Mr.\n[M.L.W.]’s case can be distinguished from those submitted by the Crown.Mr.\n[M.L.W.] has a break in his record of seven and half years between his last\nconviction for a drinking and driving offence and the current offence. The\noffender in Bear had no such break in his record.It is difficult to\ntell from the case report on Kakakaway the length of any break in that\noffender’s record.The court in Kakakaway, however, based its finding\nthat service of a conditional sentence in the community would likely endanger\nthe community on the ground that Kakakaway was on probation at the time\nof re-offending. This suggests there was no significant break in his record.\nSimilarly, in Whitehead, it is difficult to tell from the case report\nexactly how long a break this 28 year old man had since his last conviction for\ndrinking and driving. The court, however, does say that Whitehead had\ntwenty previous driving offences and that he had a “persistent record” of these\noffences. This suggests no significant break in Whitehead’s record.[18]In addition to the\nissue of a break in Mr. [M.L.W.]’s record, all three of the cases referred to\nby the Crown can be distinguished on the unique circumstances of this case.\nAfter a lengthy period of sobriety, Mr. [M.L.W.] began drinking around the time\nof testifying at his residential school trial. His counsellor indicates this\nlitigation process triggered unresolved issues from the past.Section 718.2(e)\nrequires the court to pay “particular attention to the circumstances of\naboriginal offenders” in considering alternatives to jail for aboriginal\noffenders. In this case there is a direct link between the offence committed\nand his circumstance as a victim of residential school abuse. There is no\nsuggestion of such a link in the cases cited above.[19]The Supreme Court of\nCanada in R. v. Gladue (1999), 1999 CanLII 679 (SCC), 133 C.C.C. (3d) 385 discussed the\napplication of Section 718.2(e) in the following terms at paragraph 81:There is no single test that a judge can\napply in order to determine the sentence.The sentencing judge is required to\ntake into account all of the surrounding circumstances regarding the offence,\nthe offender, the victims, and the community, including the unique\ncircumstances of the offender as an aboriginal person. Sentencing must proceed\nwith sensitivity to and understanding of the difficulties aboriginal people\nhave faced with both the criminal justice system and society at large.When\nevaluating these circumstances in light of the aims and principles of\nsentencing as set out in Part XXIII of the Criminal Code and in the\njurisprudence, the judge must strive to arrive at a sentence which is just and\nappropriate in the circumstances.By means of s. 718.2(e), sentencing judges\nhave been provided with a degree of flexibility and discretion to consider in\nappropriate circumstances alternative sentences to incarceration which are\nappropriate for the aboriginal offender and community and yet comply with the\nmandated principles and purpose of sentencing...[20]In my view, there\ncould be few more compelling applications of section 718.2(e) than the\nsituation faced by Mr. [M.L.W.].In this case, Mr. [M.L.W.], after a lengthy\nperiod of sobriety, began drinking again shortly after testifying at his\nresidential school trial. As his counsellor Dr. Saunders summarised: “when he\nstarted to seek legal compensation for the abuse that he suffered as a child\nmany of the old unresolved issues resurfaced and [M.L.W.] started to abuse\nalcohol again”.[21]In considering the\napplication of section 718.2(e) to this case, the court must consider whether a\nconditional sentence of imprisonment can be considered a fit sentence for Mr.\n[M.L.W.], as an alternative to incarceration in a correctional facility.[22]Section 742.1\nrequires, first, that the sentence be one of imprisonment for less than two\nyears.Considering the circumstances of this offence and this offender, I have\nconcluded that a period of imprisonment of two years less a day is an appropriate\nsentence for Mr. [M.L.W.] in this case. In doing so I have considered the break\nin his record since his last conviction for drinking and driving, his exemplary\nbehaviour since the date of this offence, and that the Crown specified a range\nof appropriate sentence of less than three years but more than one year.[23]Section 742.1 next\nrequires that the court be satisfied that service of this sentence by Mr.\n[M.L.W.] in the community would not endanger the safety of the community. In R.\nv. John (2004), 182 C.C.C. (3d) (273 Sask. C. A.), the Court of Appeal granted\na conditional sentence to an aboriginal offender convicted of criminal\nnegligence causing death.In considering whether that offender posed a danger\nto the community within the meaning of section 742.1, Vancise J.A. commented:[51] The issue\nis whether the individual offender poses a risk to society while serving the\nsentence in the community.In Proulx, Chief Justice Lamer held that\nthere were two factors to be taken into account to decide whether this\nprecondition has been satisfied: (1) the risk of the offender reoffending; and\n(2) the gravity of the damage that could issue in the event of a reoffending.The factors to consider in deciding whether the offender poses a risk to\nserving the sentence in the community are: whether the offender is likely to\nabide by the order; the nature of the offence; the circumstances of the\noffence; the degree of participation by the offender; the profile of the\noffender including lifestyle, occupation, and criminal record; conduct\nfollowing the offence; and the danger the offender represents to the community\naffected by the offence.[24]I have concluded\nthat service of this sentence by Mr. [M.L.W.] in the community would not\nendanger the community. In reaching this conclusion, I have considered that Mr.\n[M.L.W.] had no convictions for drinking and driving between 1996 and 2003,\nthat this offence occurred shortly after his residential school litigation\ntrial, and that his return to drinking was caused, in large part, by the trauma\nassociated with revisiting the issues surrounding his residential school claim.\nMr. [M.L.W.] now has significant support from his aboriginal community as well\nas professional support for his continued treatment and healing in dealing with\nthe trauma from his past. He has remained sober since the offence and has\nactively pursued treatment and employment.He has been active in doing\ncommunity work including working for the Regina Food Bank. He has enrolled in\nan education program commencing in August, for which he will receive funding\nthat will help support his wife and his infant child.[25]Section 742.1 lastly\nrequires the court to consider whether a conditional sentence of imprisonment\nis consistent with the purpose and principles of sentencing set out in Sections\n718 to 718.2 of the Criminal Code.In particular, regarding whether the\nprinciples of denunciation and deterrence can be accomplished through a\nconditional sentence, Vancise J.A. in John, commented:“[55] The primary question here is whether\nthe principles of denunciation and deterrence can be satisfied by the\nimposition of a community-based sentence.In my opinion, the principles of\ndeterrence and denunciation can be satisfied by the imposition of strict\nconditions in a conditional sentence of imprisonment.The principle of\ndenunciation, which the communication of society’s condemnation of the\noffender’s conduct can be achieved without a custodial sentence.....Incarceration will usually provide more\ndenunciation than a conditional sentence of imprisonment, but a conditional\nsentence which deprives or restricts an offender’s liberty can effectively\nsatisfy those principles.The Supreme Court of Canada made it clear in Proulx\nthat severe restrictions on the offender’s liberty are to be the norm and not\nthe exception.[26]In Mr. [M.L.W.]’s\ncase, I have concluded that the conditional sentence of imprisonment I will\nimpose is consistent with the purpose and principles of sentencing as set out\nin the Criminal Code. As per the comments of Vancise J.A. above, I am\nsatisfied that this conditional sentence will restrict Mr. [M.L.W.]’s liberty\nto a significant extent, and will provide both deterrence and denunciation. I\nam also satisfied that a conditional sentence, as opposed to a jail sentence,\nis consistent with the principle of sentencing set out in section 718.2(e) of\nthe Criminal Code.[27]As a result, on the\ncharge under section 253(b), I sentence Mr. [M.L.W.] to a conditional sentence\nof imprisonment of two years less a day. In addition to the statutory\nconditions contained in section 742.3(1), he shall abide by the following\nconditions:[28]You shall comply\nwith the following Electronic Monitoring conditions for a period of SIX (6)\nMONTHS from today’s date:a)You shall\nreport immediately, in person to the Probation Officer/Supervisor or designate,\nat Regina Probation Services, 2nd Floor, 1942 Hamilton Street, Regina, Saskatchewan and once\nper week thereafter at times specified by the Probation Officer/Supervisor.b)You shall\nparticipate in the Electronic Monitoring Program and will abide by the rules\nand regulations of that program.c)You must\nreside at [address] until you have written permission from the Probation\nOfficer/Supervisor or designate to reside elsewhere.d)You shall\nbe confined to your residence from today’s date until March 22, 2005 and must\nreceive written permission from the Probation Officer/Supervisor or designate\nto be absent from your residence.e)You must\npersonally present yourself to any Peace Officer monitoring the provisions of\nthis Order.f)You shall\nnot purchase, possess or consume alcohol, and you shall provide a suitable\nsample of breath when demanded to so by a Peace Officer who has reason to\nbelieve you have alcohol in your body.g)You must\nmaintain your present employment, if any, and must notify the Probation\nOfficer/Supervisor immediately of any change in the status of your employment.h)You must\nnot enter any licensed premises where the primary purpose is the consumption or\nsale of alcohol unless you have written permission from the Probation\nOfficer/Supervisor for employment purposes.2.Thereafter\nyou shall report to a Probation Officer/Supervisor at such times and places as\ndirected.3.You shall\nabide by the lawful instructions of the Probation Officer/Supervisor or his/her\ndesignate, especially in regard to specific programming which may include:Substance abuse programming - You shall participate actively as\ndirected by the Probation Officer/Supervisor in detoxification, assessment,\neducation, counselling and/or treatment in an approved program for substance\nabuse, including attendance at a residential treatment facility, and you shall\nnot give cause for dismissal from such program.4.Following\nthe six month period of electronic monitoring, you shall abide by a curfew, and\nbe in yourresidence between 10p.m. and 7 a.m. each day\nunless given written permission by your Probation Officer/Supervisor to be\nabsent, or in the case of a medical emergency.5.You shall perform\n150 hours of community service work within ten months to the satisfaction of\nyour Probation Officer/Supervisor.[29]Given Mr. [M.L.W.]’s limited income, I waive the\nvictim fine surcharge, as I believe it would be an undue hardship for his\nfamily.Regarding the charge under s. 89(1) of the Highway Traffic Act,\nI fine Mr. [M.L.W.] the sum of $540 including surcharge, and give him two\nmonths to pay.R.G.\nGREEN, PCJ"}

Murphy, for the respondent.[1]Barry, J.: This is an appeal from the sentence imposed upon the\nappellant in Provincial Court at Gander on December 8, 1986, by His Honor Judge\nOwen Kennedy where the appellant had been charged with having operated a motor\nvehicle on a highway while his blood-alcohol level exceeded 80 milligrams of\nalcohol in 100 millilitres of blood contrary to s. 239(1) (a) of the Criminal\nCode of Canada (the Code).[2]At trial, after receiving the appellant's guilty plea, the trial judge\nasked Crown counsel for a summary of the evidence whereupon the following\nstatement of the facts of the case was offered by the Crown:“On the 5th of December, 1986 at approximately quarter to\neight in the evening at Gander, Newfoundland, while on patrol on Airport\nBoulevard a vehicle operated by the defendant, Mr. Carlson, was noted\nstraddling two lanes on Airport Boulevard, between Memorial Drive and\nFitzmaurice Road. The vehicle was checked and there were three male occupants.\nThe driver was Mr. Carlson. He was subsequently given the A.L.E.R.T. demand and\nregistered a 'fail'. A breathalyzer demand and rights to counsel were given and at the time he was returned to Gander\ndetachment. Two tests were taken; the first at\n8:13 and the second\nat 8:31, both 140 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres\nof blood.”He then asked the appellant if he had anything to say whereupon\nthe appellant replied:“Yes sir. This incident happened on Friday night and I haven't\nhad a chance to have a lawyer present, but I do have a character witness who is\nmy supervisor who was present at that time.”The appellant called a witness, one Bob Birbine, who testified\nas follows:“I'm up here on temporary duty with Mr. Carlson doing ice\nreconnaissance and I've known Mr. Carlson for approximately ten years and I can\nattest to his being a decent citizen. He has never been involved in any traffic\nviolation and he's a law abiding citizen; he has a wife and kid … two kids,\nsorry, and I got nothing to say but everything is good and this is the first\ntime this happened to him and I'm asking the leniency of the court and I do\nrealize the seriousness of this situation and possibly I should have been\ndriving that truck. He did ask me to drive it but I didn't actually. I can\nattest to him being an upstanding citizen.”[3]The appellant was then asked if he had anything further to say to which\nhe replied in the negative. The trial judge then imposed sentence upon the\nappellant as set out in the following excerpt from his judgment:“Okay, sir, in relation to the offence I'm imposing a fine of\n$500.00. The fine is payable within a period of sixty days. As well sir, it's\nmandatory that I make an order to prohibit you from driving pursuant to the\nprovisions of the Criminal Code. In relation to the circumstances\nadduced before me, I'm making an order pursuant to s. 242 of the Criminal\nCode to prohibit you from driving for a period of one year.”[4]The appellant has appealed the sentence upon the following grounds:1. That the sentence was inordinately high having regard to\nthe nature of the offence, the circumstances of its commission and the\nantecedents of the appellant.2. The trial judge did not adequately consider the principles\nof sentencing, particularly that of the rehabilitation of the appellant,\nplacing too much emphasis upon general deterrence.[5]The incident happened on the evening of December 5, 1986 and the trial\nwas held the following Monday. When asked if he had anything to say following\nthe delivery of the above summary by the Crown, the appellant said he had not\nhad an opportunity to have a lawyer present because the offence had happened\nonly on the previous Friday. The limited time he had within which to contact a\nsolicitor was evident since it is well known in this area that law offices are\nclosed on Saturdays and Sundays. It is true he could have asked for a\npostponement, but he was not advised of his right to do so. His comment\nindicates that he would like to have had the services of a lawyer to advise him\nas to his legal position or to speak for him in court. His plea of guilty,\nhowever, was categorical and unqualified and is not in contention upon this\nappeal. In the circumstances, the trial judge could do no more than to enter a\nconviction against him.[6]However, the penalty aspect of the offence is a very important matter\nfor the appellant as for any accused person. He is entitled to a sentence\nhearing, to be represented at it by a legal counsel, to call witnesses and to\ntestify himself respecting the sentence to be imposed upon him. It appears that\nthe short time given him to prepare for his trial prevented him from making a\nmore effective representation respecting the sentence to be imposed.[7]In cases such as this considerations of protection of the public,\ndeterrence to others and to the appellant are the prime factors which must be\ntaken into account by a trial judge in determining an appropriate penalty upon\nconviction of an accused person. A secondary factor, but also of great\nimportance, is that of reformation of the accused.[8]The Canadian Sentencing Commission in its report entitled, Sentencing\nReform, A Canadian Approach (published February 1987) stated at page 154\nthat amongst other principles of sentencing to be considered by a judge in\nimposing sentence, two are taken to be foremost:“a) The paramount principle governing the determination of a\nsentence is that the sentence be proportionate to the gravity of the offence\nand the degree or responsibility of the offender for the offence.“b) Second, the emphasis being on the accountability of the\noffender rather than punishment, a sentence should be the least onerous\nsanction appropriate in the circumstances and the maximum penalty prescribed\nfor an offence should be imposed only in the most serious cases.”[9]These principles must be applied within the limits of penalties for\nparticular offences set by the Criminal Code and they are very relevant\nhere because this is a first offence and because evidence of good character has\nbeen adduced by the appellant.[10]In this case it is to be noted that the appellant was driving his vehicle,\nstraddling two lanes of the highway when seen by the police officer who\napprehended him and that his blood-alcohol proportion was almost twice the\npermissible level. The fact that he was driving over parts of two adjoining\ntraffic lanes does not necessarily mean that this was a result of his\ninsobriety, as many sober persons do this. However, it may well be that this\nwas the cause of his errant driving on this occasion.[11]Here, the appellant’s moderately high\nblood-alcohol proportion was the only factor which militated for a higher than\nminimum penalty. There were no aggravating factors and no evidence of danger to\npersons or damage to property caused by the appellant's manner of driving.\nAlthough where alcohol is involved, it must be borne in mind that there is\nalways potential danger to persons or property on the scene or to be later\nencountered; nevertheless, penalties should be imposed in the light of all of\nthe circumstances. These circumstances must include an appraisal of the accused\nhimself as well as an assessment of his behaviour at the time of the actual\noccurrence of the offence and of the incident giving rise to the charge. Severe\npenalties have been prescribed by Parliament for persons who commit this\noffence and it is encumbent upon the trial judge to select one which will be\nappropriate in the circumstances of the particular case. The penalty of\nprohibition from driving a motor vehicle which must be imposed should be\nmeasured in the scale of gravity of the offence for a period between the minimum\nof three months and the maximum of three years.[12]In determining the position of the appellant's offence in this scale the\ntrial judge should have had regard, inter alia, to sentences imposed by courts\nin other areas of the province, not only as guiding precedents, but also to\nmaintain some degree of consistency in punishments meted out for similar\noffences. In this case, counsel for the appellant contended that the penalty\nimposed was much higher than that given for such offences in provincial courts\nin other centers in the province and he cited a number of recent unreported\ncases in support of that allegation where substantially lower periods of\nsuspension of driver's license were imposed in similar cases.[13]The trial judge clearly attached great weight to the primary aspects of\nthe sentence to be imposed, but it appears that he gave little or no\nconsideration to its secondary aspects or to the relative gravity of the\noffence. The following are particular factors which the trial judge should have\nconsidered when imposing sentence:1. This was his first offence.2. His superintendent spoke highly of him\nas a person of good character.3. The appellant exhibited a sense of responsibility in\nattempting to persuade or to prevail upon his superintendent who was with him\nat the time to drive the vehicle, and only proceeded to drive himself when the\nlatter refused.4. No danger to safety to others or of property was shown to\nexist at the time of the offence.5 There were no aggravating factors.6. The appellant was not represented at the trial and\nindicated that he had not had an opportunity to have legal counsel represent\nhim because of the short time intervening between commission of the offence and\nthe trial. Although not a ground of appeal herein, his indication to the court\nthat he would have counsel present if there had been time to engage one should\nhave been considered by the trial judge. No doubt had he been represented other\nfactors in his favour may have been brought forward to the attention of the court.[14]There is no indication that the trial judge considered any of these\nfactors when determining a suitable punishment for the appellant. It would\nappear that the sentence herein, i.e., suspension of license for 12 months is\nsubstantially higher than that usually imposed upon persons convicted of this\noffence in other Provincial Courts in this province where there were no\naggravating or special circumstances which would justify a heavy penalty. For\nthe foregoing reasons, I find that the trial judge erred in imposing such a\nsevere sentence upon the appellant when there were no grounds evident in the\nfacts before him to support it.[15]Accordingly, I allow this appeal and I order that the period of\nsuspension of driver's license imposed upon the appellant be varied to six\nmonths. In other respects I confirm the decision of the learned trial judge.Appeal allowed."}

ThompsonCounsel\nfor the Provincial CrownW. BuchnerCounsel\nfor the Federal CrownF. AmbrogioCounsel\nfor K. M.G. RaynerCounsel\nfor J. S.REASONS FOR SENTENCESCHNALL,\nJ. (Orally):I have two young persons before me, who have been charged as youths\nunder the Youth Criminal Justice Act.K. M., at the time of these\noffences, was about a month short of his 18th birthday; J. S. was\nabout five months short of his 18th birthday.These two young men,\nunder the conditions and provisions of the law, were almost adults.Their\nyouth, therefore, and their age are not mitigating factors as such, as we might\nhave expected with someone who is 12 or 13 and commits these types of\noffences.They are months away — very short months away from being of an age\nwhere the law and the community would have considered them as adults,\nresponsible for their actions.Their youth, however, and being under the age\nof 18, clearly places them within the provisions of the Youth Criminal\nJustice Act, where certain things apply to youth that do not apply to\nadults and vice-versa.S. and M. have\nboth been charged with damage to property in excess of $5,000, that is Section\n430(4).The Crown elected to proceed summarily on that count.They have both been\ncharged under Section 182(b); that is an indictable offence, carrying a maximum\nof five years in jail, if they had been charged as adults. S. also has a simple\npossession of a narcotic charge and I will have to deal with that as well.The damage to property and the Section 182 charge,\nindignity, relate to a cemetery in the City of London.These two young men\ncreated an overwhelming amount of damage in terms of physical property,\nspecifically 86 headstones or monuments being damaged, many of them beyond any\npossibility of repair; many of them belonging to individuals of the community\nwho no longer have relatives available to contribute to the repair of that\ndamage.Eleven of those monuments add up to $33,000, which is a formidable\nexpense, which has not yet been incurred by the governors of the cemetery.In addition, there is damage to windows of a chapel and a\nbroken bench.All of that damage adds up to $48,005.That is just part of the damage that has occurred as a\nresult of the actions of these two young men.That is the tangible,\nobservable, assessable damage.There is no dollar value that can be placed on the\npsychological and emotional damage that has happened to the family and\nrelatives of those who are buried in that cemetery, to the community at large,\nand to the directors or governors of the cemetery itself, who are mandated to\ncare for these monuments.The Crown submits that there has been a community outcry,\nand certainly an understandable outrage because of what has happened to the\nproperty in this cemetery.The court must be seen to have, and does have, the\nrole of reflecting the repugnance and the denunciation of the community of\nwhich these two young men are a part.Unlike the community at large, being the general community,\nwho are the citizens and occupants and residents of this city, and the specific\ncommunity, who are the family and relatives of loved ones who are interred in\nthat cemetery, who have been very directly and significantly affected, the\ncourt has to remain dispassionate and objective, and as such, this court has to\nbe guided by very specific sentencing provisions that are set out in the Youth\nCriminal Justice Act.The court can certainly acknowledge, and does acknowledge\nthe emotional distress and pain and outrage of those who have been affected,\nbut must always remain objective in its assessment of a number of factors,\nincluding the particular circumstances of the individuals who stand before the\ncourt, their antecedents as the Crown refers to them, their current\ncircumstances, the pre-sentence reports which have been prepared, the\ninvolvement of family, for example, and also the circumstances of the\noffences.There is a range of options that is available to the\ncourt.The court cannot step outside of that range of options, based solely on\nthe horrific nature of this type of criminal offence and the resultant profound\nimpact on members of the general community and the specific community, to which\nI have referred.The Crown has correctly drawn the court’s attention to\ncertain provisions in the Youth Criminal Justice Act, to determine what\nthose options are.In every case, the court has to consider the specific\noffender or offenders and the specific offences, and there is always a spectrum\nalong which a given sentence will fall.Is this the worst offence and the\nworst offender, or is it something less than that?This offence comes very close to being the worst offence of\nthis nature.It is probably the worst offence that the directors and managers\nof the cemetery can envision, short of, perhaps, the kind of circumstance that\nthe Crown referred to, which is the sacrilegious or satanic spray painting,\ndesecration type of offence, but this one is almost there, given the nature of\nthe damage, the overwhelming amount of damage.I’m going to deal first with Mr M., and I do intend to\ntreat the two young men differently; they have different circumstances, they\ncome to this court in different positions.Their involvement in the offences\nis identical, but their respective positions as they come to the court, place\nthem in somewhat different categories.I will deal with Mr M. and then I will\ndeal with Mr S..I have indicated certainly, the context in which the court\nhas to see all of these matters, and before I proceed, it is appropriate to\ngive each one of these young men an opportunity to address the court, and as I\nsaid, I am going to start with Mr M..Is there anything that you want to say?You do not have to if you do not wish to, but you may, if you like.K. M.:I’d like to say that I’m embarrassed and ashamed of\nwhat I did, and I’m very, very sorry for all the pain and suffering I put\npeople through.THE COURT:Thank you, you can sit down.Mr S., is there\nanything that you want to say?J. S.:I’d like to say sorry to my parents, to the\ncommunity.I’m very ashamed of what I’ve done and I’m sorry.THE COURT:Thank you.The provisions of the Youth\nCriminal Justice Act, specifically Section 39, set out that a court may not\nimpose a custodial disposition unless the matter fits within certain\nexceptions.The Crown has noted those exceptions, I have reviewed them again.I have reviewed Section 39 and the relevant integrated\nsection, the Section 38, which sets out specifically the purpose and principles\nof sentencing and specifically, sub-paragraph (3) of that section.I’m not\ngoing to read it, the Crown has referred to the specific aspects of it.What\nis significant and why I refer to those sections now for Mr M. is that overall,\nhis background, the absence of a record, except for the one incident in 2001,\nand the nature of this offence, on the face of it, would not place him into the\ncategory where the court would impose a custodial sentence, except for\nparagraph (d) under Section 39(1), and that is:In exceptional cases where the young person has\ncommitted an indictable offence, the aggravating circumstances of the offence\nare such that the imposition of a non-custodial sentence would be inconsistent\nwith the purpose and principles set out in Section 38.And in Section 38, I agree with the Crown’s\nsubmissions that the court has to look at subsection (3), paragraphs (a)\nthrough (f) and in particular:The degree of participation by theyoung\nperson...the harm done tovictims and whether it was intentionalor\nreasonably foreseeable...and any other aggravating and mitigating circumstances\nrelated to the young person or the offence that are relevant to the purpose and\nprinciples set out in this section.Section 38(1) sets out the purpose, and I will just\nvery briefly refer to it, so that these young men and their parents will\nrecognize what the court is talking about.The purpose of sentencing is to hold a young person\naccountable through the imposition of just sanctions that have meaningful\nconsequences forthe young person, and that promote his or her rehabilitation\nand reintegration into society, contributing to the long term protection of the\npublic.Section 38(2) sets out the principles, in\nsubparagraphs (a) through (e) and I will paraphrase them:The sentence must not result in a punishment that is\ngreater than the punishment that would be appropriate for an adult in the same\ncircumstances; must be similar to the sentences imposed in the region on\nsimilar young persons found guilty of the same offence, committed in similar\ncircumstances; must be proportionate to the seriousness of the offence and the\ndegree of responsibility of the person for that offence.All available\nsanctions other that custody that are reasonable, and that is an important\npart, in the circumstances should be considered.The sentence must be the\nleast restrictive that is capable of setting out and accomplishing these\npurposes and most likely to rehabilitate the young person and reintegrate him,\nand promote a sense of responsibility and an acknowledgement of the harm done\nto victims and the community.And then we have subsection\n(3), to which the Crown referred.K. M. fits into the exceptional circumstances case.I impose six months in open custody, which will be four months in custody and\ntwo months in community supervision, and probation to follow.In terms of\nthese two young men and their responsibility and participation, each one\nparticipated one hundred percent, fully, in the commission of these offences;\nno one else did.Alcohol and substance abuse and the consumptionof\nalcohol and substances by one or both of these individuals that night, is\nabsolutely not a mitigating factor, neither for Mr M. nor for Mr S., and I will\nreturn to Mr S. in a moment.Mr M. certainly has the support\nof his father, but he comes before the court not as a first time offender.He\nhas had the benefit of probation in the past, he has had the benefit of\ncommunity service in the past; neither of those has stopped him from involving\nhimself in this offence.Further rehabilitation and\nreintegration is certainly available for him in the custodial setting and in\nprobation which will follow, and that certainly is true for both boys.Following six months of\ncustody, being four plus two, Mr M. will be subject to a term of probation for\na period of 18 months, which takes me to the maximum sentence that the court\ncan impose for this type of offence on a young person, which is two years....THE COURT ADDRESSES COURT CLERKMr M. does not seem to have the\nsame types of difficulties that Mr S. does.I have read the pre-sentence\nreport relating to Mr M..I note the one item of record,\nto which I have already referred.I am very cognizant of his father’s concern\nfor him, his father’s support, and the fact that there has been some\ndifficulties in the family unit in the past, that are referred to in the\npre-sentence report; I do not need to put them into the record.Mr M., that is, K. M., has\nplans to continue with his education.His education record is marred by the\nnumber of suspensions, by things like persistent opposition to authority, use\nof profane language, conduct injurious to the moral tone of the school, and so\non.He appears to be doing better and indeed, after changing schools has\nmaintained a solid “B” average in his elementary schools.When he enrolled in\nsecondary school he did not do as well, but the change in schools gives him\nmarks in the “B” to “C” range.He has potential, excellent effort and I\nacknowledge all of that.The needs for his\nrehabilitation are not as profound as those of Mr S. and the length of sentence\nis intended to reflect that.The terms of your probation order, Mr M., for a\nperiod of 18 months concurrent on all charges:that you keep the peace and be\nof good behaviour; report to this court when required to do so by the court.You are to report to a probation officer within two business days after you are\nreleased from custody, reporting thereafter as directed and remain under the\nsupervision of a probation officer.You are to notify your probation officer\nof any change in your residence, address or telephone number, any change in the\nplace of your employment, education or training.You are to attend school or\nan education program approved of by your probation officer, every day unless\nyou are sick, attending all scheduled classes punctually, use your best efforts\nat the schoolwork or the program, and obey the routine and discipline of the\nschool or program.If you are not pursuing your education, you will make\nreasonable efforts to find and maintain employment. You will have a curfew, if\nit is set for you in writing by your probation officer.You are not to associate nor\ncommunicate, directly or indirectly, with anybody named in writing by your\nprobation officer, in addition to J. S..You are not to attend upon the\nproperty known as the Mount Pleasant Cemetery in London, unless in the company\nof a parent, or with written prior approval of your probation officer.You are\nto reside at the home of your father and obey the routine and discipline of that\nresidence.You are not to possess nor consume alcohol, nor any non-prescribed\nnarcotic, restricted or controlled drug that is not medically prescribed for\nyou.You are to undertake any assessment, actively participate in and\nsuccessfully complete any counselling or therapy that your probation officer\ndirects, in particular with respect to alcohol and substance abuse.You will\nnot discontinue such program without the written approval of your probation\nofficer.Counselling or therapy shall not include detention for treatment.It is a struggle to ascertain\nthe appropriate disposition with respect to restitution or compensation —\nfinancial compensation.If Mr M. were two months older\nat the time than he was, I would have been able to make a stand alone\nrestitution order, which acts as a judgment and could be collected just like\nany other judgment in a civil court.I do not have that option available.I have to recognize as well,\nthat in spite of being just two months short of being an adult, Mr M. is at the\ntime of this offence, a young person with limited abilities to pay financial\ncompensation, and that has to be recognized.It would be unduly harsh,\nalthoughnot unreasonable if one looks\nat the total amount of damage, it would be unduly harsh for the court to impose\neven $15,000 divided by two.These two young men do not have full time jobs.It appears to me that it may well be overwhelming and therefore\ncounter-productive for the court to order the sum of $7,500 to be paid.Mr M. will pay $4,000 prior to\nthe end of his probation term; not paying it constitutes a breach.If I had\nordered $7,500 I would not have said the last part; in other words, $7,500 in\nmy view, would be too much and it would be punitive to consider non-payment of\nthat as a breach.Four thousand dollars is a reduced amount, and in my view,\nis doable.Failure to pay will be a breach, which will result in a charge of\nbreach of probation, which will then probably extend the probation or result in\ncustody, and I address my comments to Mr S. as well.Four thousand dollars\nwill be paid as follows — counsel you can just monitor these numbers and make\nsure I have not misspoken myself.He is going to spend time in custody, Mr\nAmbrogio, so I need to take that into account.I was contemplating half in the\nfirst year, half in the second, but he needs more than that for the first\nhalf.So, my order is $2,000 to be paid by March 31st, 2006 and the balance by the end of probation in December of 2007, but I need to\nprobably look at that again and make sure that we are in the right place for\nthat.His probation will end on December 2nd, 2006; I think that\nfits.MR AMBROGIO:I think that’s\ncorrect, Your Honour.MR THOMPSON:I think that’s\nright.THE COURT:Thank you, Mr\nAmbrogio.Mr Thompson, have I addressed all the components of the sentencing\nthat the Crown was inviting me to consider?MR THOMPSON:Unless I missed\nit Your Honour, I also invited you to consider the community service.THE COURT:Yes, you did.I\nwas contemplating — and I can invite fine tuning from all counsel, I was\ncontemplating an order that would recognize the balance of the $7,500 for each\nof them, and although it would certainly be more than the minimum wage, and\nprobably more than many young adults earn, I would order 100 hours of community\nservice work, and if they were to be paid the excessive amount of $35 per hour,\nthey would be working off the balance of the $3,500 for the benefit of this\ncommunity.I would be concerned that anything over 100 hours may appear\nexcessive, given the fact that they are each serving custodial sentences.Mr M.,\nyou will perform 100 hours of community service work.Can you deal with 10\nhours per month as a minimum?K. M.:Yes.THE COURT:The other reason\nwhy I did not want to consider more, was because both young men will need to be\ngetting jobs so that they can pay restitution, and contemplating finishing\ntheir schooling, as well.Ten hours is the minimum per month, to start within\n30 days after you are released from custody.Anything else, Mr Thompson, for\nMr M.?MR THOMPSON:No, Your Honour.MR AMBROGIO:Your Honour, I\nwonder if I could just interrupt for a moment?THE COURT:Please.MR AMBROGIO:I was paged to\nanother court about 45 minutes ago, I wonder if I could just be excused at this\npoint.I have reviewed your sentence withMr M. and he understands — I’m\nconfident he understands.If I could be excused at this point?THE COURT:Yes, thank you.Thank you for your assistance, Mr Ambrogio.Mr S. comes to this court in a\nsomewhat different position; he has more serious aggravating factors.My\ncomment previously, that being drunk or high cannot be considered a mitigating\nfactor in these circumstances, is particularly applicable to Mr S..Mr S. does\nnot have what one would consider a positive pre-sentence report.I read the\nFamily Court Clinic Assessment that was provided to me with respect to Mr S.;\nit was prepared in February of 2003, and I have read the pre-sentence report\nthat I ordered as an update to that report.Very little of what was\nrecommended by the Family Court Clinic in February of 2003, has been\naccomplished by Mr S..Mr S. is almost an adult and is\nresponsible for making a lot of his own decisions.I have to say that the\ncourt can only be exceedingly impressed with the amount of support and concern\nthat Mr S.’ parents have demonstrated.I have a great deal of empathy for\nparents who strive as hard as these two parents have done for a child or\nchildren, and come up against what appears to be the brick wall of resistance\non the part of their son.I appreciate that Mrs S. would very much like for J.\nto be involved in a rehabilitative program to deal with substance abuse.But\nit is not Mrs S. who would go to Camp Dare or Portage, it is J., and I have no\nsense of confidence that, until he walked into this courtroom today, that J. S.\nwas truly amenable, receptive and would be cooperative to that program.I have seen nothing from Mr S.,\nin any of the evidence before me, that he has taken any steps since this\noffence occurred at the beginning of September and now three months later, to\ndemonstrate his desire to truly rehabilitate himself.On the contrary, what we\nhave are numerous references in the pre-sentence report, as to what recommendations\nhave been made for him, what options have been offered, what resources have\nbeen made available and to which he has been encouraged to respond, and he has\nnot done so.The pre-sentence report, on pages three and four, lists those\nresources, and on the one hand, the report says that J. attended sessions at\nthe B.E.T. Program for example, punctually and he was described as a good\nparticipant.He attended five sessions and after that, of course, the program\nwas cancelled.That is not his fault, but when that program became available\nagain, he was contacted and did not respond.He has not rejoined that group;\nhis rehabilitation came to a standstill, and by the offences he has caused, in\nfact, he regressed.Similarly, he has problems with\nsubstance abuse and when he was directed to participate — or invited to\nparticipate at the Addiction Services of Thames Valley he never followed\nthrough.There is nothing before me to indicate that in the last three months\nhe has contacted them; to the contrary, he has not done any of those things.David Bogert is a counsellor who has received telephone calls from J.’s mother,\nexpressing her concern and her desire that J. re-involve himself in\ncounselling, and again, his mother is doing the work, J. is not.J. acknowledges that he has a\nsubstance abuse problem; I have seen nothing in the report that reflects that\nin the last three months he has done anything about that.His desire to be\ninvolved in counselling and in therapeutic treatment of any kind, that he now\nexpresses through his counsel today, have the resonance of the courtroom door\nrehabilitation, which is at its highest as you walk through the courtroom\ndoor.I do not have the confidence that J. would be amenable to the kind of\nprogram that Portage offers; however, I do not discount that as a possibility.Portage requires commitment by an individual and it also requires a lengthy\nopen custody disposition, at a minimum of six months.Camp DARE is also an option.I\ncanvassed with J.’s counsel as to whether those options have been canvassed\nfully.In the three months since September, there would have been ample time\nto contact Portage and have this young man interviewed to see if he would be\nconsidered a suitable candidate; we do not have that.I appreciate the comment that J.\nthinks he is going to jail, and he is.I appreciate that J. thinks that he is\nnot doing well and so he appears to have become hopeless and depressed, but he\nhas done little to address his issues and gain the help that is readily\navailable for him.And, therefore, I say, and I agree and accept the Crown’s\nsubmissions, that the court ought not to take into account as a mitigating\nfactor, the level of alcohol consumption and drug consumption that was evident\nand admitted to, on the night of these offences.J. has a record which places\nhim in a considerably different category from that of his co-accused, and\nspecifically as an aggravating factor, the fact that he was on probation at the\ntime.I read out those sections of the\nYouth Criminal Justice Act, that require the court to consider similar\nsentences for similar offences, in similar circumstances.The case to which\nthe Crown referred me, reflected a sentence for a young person who had no\nrecord, receiving a nine month open custody disposition.I appreciate that\nthat case had some other overtones to it, to which the Crown pointed, and which\nI accept as distinguishing; on the other hand, that individual had no record.J. S., I am imposing nine\nmonths in custody, being six months in open custody and three months under\ncommunity supervision, to be followed by 15 months probation, which puts you at\nthe maximum of a youth sentence.The terms of your probation order......THE COURT ADDRESSES COURT CLERK...are that you keep the peace\nand be of good behaviour; that you report to this court when required to do\nso.You will report to a probation officer within two business days after you\nare released from custody, thereafter as directed, and remain under the\nsupervision of a probation officer.You are to notify your probation officer\nof any change in your residence address or telephone number, place of where you\ngo to school or pursue your education, or if you get a job.You are to attend an education\nprogram approved of by your probation officer, attending it or school every day\nunless you are sick; going to all your scheduled classes punctually; use your\nbest efforts at the school or the program; obey the routine and discipline of\nthe school or program.If you are not pursuing your education, you are to make\nreasonable efforts to maintain suitable employment.You will have a curfew if\none is set for you in writing by your probation officer.You are not to\nassociate nor communicate, directly or indirectly, with any person named in\nwriting by your probation officer, in addition to K. M..You are not to attend\nthe property known as Mount Pleasant Cemetery, London, unless in the company of\na parent, or with written approval prior from your probation officer.You are\nto reside where directed by your probation officer, who is a delegate of the\nprovincial director, and obey the routine and discipline of that residence.Your probation officer can tell you where you live; that may be at the home of\nyour parents, or it may be somewhere else, and you have to abide by the house\nrules.You will not possess nor consume alcohol or any non-prescribed\nnarcotic, restricted or controlled drug that is not medically prescribed for\nyou.You are to undertake any assessment, actively participate in, and\nsuccessfully complete any counselling or therapy that your probation officer\ndirects, in particular with respect to alcohol and substance abuse.You are\nnot to discontinue counselling or therapy without the written approval of your\nprobation officer.You will do 100 hours of community service work, a minimum\nof 10 hours per month. Can you handle that?You are nodding, is that a yes?J. S.:Yes.THE COURT:To start within 30\ndays. You will pay the sum of $4,000 to Mount Pleasant Cemetery.ForMr M.\nand Mr S., that money is to be paid through the clerk of the court.Two\nthousand dollars is to be paid by June 30th of 2006, balance by end\nof probation.THE COURT:Mr Thompson, is\nthere anything else that I have not referred to, that the Crown had invited me\nto consider?MR THOMPSON:No, Your\nHonour...THE COURT:I need to deal with\nthe...MR THOMPSON:...other than\nthe...THE COURT:...federal matter.MR THOMPSON:...federal\nmatter.THE COURT:Six months\nprobation, concurrent on the drug charge.Have we dealt with all the charges\nfor both these young men?MR THOMPSON:Yes, Your\nHonour.I take it in terms of those dispositions, they’re concurrent on each\nof the two?THE COURT:Yes, I did say that\nwith M....MR THOMPSON:Yes.THE COURT:...but I did not\nsay it with S., and yes, that is quite correct, thank you.THE COURT:All right.Constable, these boys are in your custody.They will be signing probation\norders, a copy to go to each set of parents please, after they are signed....\nWHEREUPON THESE PROCEEDINGS WERE CONCLUDEDFORM 2Certificate of TranscriptEvidence Act, Subsection 5(2)I, Diana Rorke,\ncertify that this document is a true and accurate transcription of the\nrecording of Regina v.

BurtonCounsel for the\nCrownG. JosephCounsel\nfor CJ Harvey BishopTHURSDAY,\nAPRIL 26, 2007CLARKE,\nJ.:ORALLY[1]In the case of R. v. Sharpe,\n2001 SCC 2 (CanLII), 2001, 1 SCR 45, the Supreme Court of Canada at page 75 said this:“The\nprimary goal of child pornography laws isto\nprevent harm to children.”At\npages 96 to 99, the court said:“Child\npornography inflicts harm on children in several ways.Children are clearly\nabused in its production.It can be used to groom or seduce victims and it may\nreduce pedophiles inhibitions respecting abuse of children.Because the market\nfor child pornography is fueled by the demand of those who wish to possess it,\ncriminalizing it may reduce that demand.”[2]S. 163.1 of the Canadian Criminal\nCode, also reflects Canada’s obligation under Article 34 of the Convention\non the Rights of the Child to protect children from sexual exploitation and\nabuse and in particular, to prevent the exploitive use of children in\npornographic performances and materials.The Convention on the Rights of the\nChild was ratified by Canada on December 13th, 1991.[3]Courts have found denunciation and\ndeterrence to be the primary sentencing objectives for this offence and\nsentences of incarceration are often imposed.For example, in R. v.\nStroempl (1995) 1995 CanLII 2283 (ON CA), 85 O.A.C. 225, a judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal;\nand in R. v Huyke, (15 May 1998) Alberta 712320; and in R. v. Ritchie [1997]\nO.J. No. 5664; and in R. v. Lisk [1998] O.J. No. 1456 (Ont. C.A),\nand other cases.[4]In addition to its international treaty\nobligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child, supra, Canada also\nratified the optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on\nthe Sale of Children, Child prostitution and Child pornography as enunciated in\nUnited Nations document A/54/263 in the year 2000, which came in to force on\nJanuary 18th, 2002.This protocol underscores the rationale for the\n1993 legislation by requiring each state party to the production, distribution\nand dissemination of child pornography punishable by appropriate penalties that\ntake the grave nature of the offence into account.[5]In R. v. Hewlett 2002 ABCA 179 (CanLII), 2002, 167 CCC\n425, Fraser, C.J.A. observed at paragraph 22:“To\nbe sure, the production of child pornography is child abuse, plain and simple\nand no attempts to rationalize or minimize this crime will ever change that.As L’Heureux-Dube, Gonthier and Bastarache JJ. stated in R. v. Sharpe,\nat page 132, the very existence of child pornography as it is defined by s.\n163.1(1) of the Criminal Code, is inherently harmful to children and to\nsociety.This harm exists independently of dissemination or any risk of\ndissemination and flows directly from the existence of the pornographic\nrepresentations which on their own violate the dignity and equality rights of\nchildren.”And\nat pages 147 and 148 it was said:“Child\npornography also undermines children’s right to life, liberty and security of\nthe person as guaranteed by s. 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and\nFreedoms.Their psychological and physical security is placed at risk by their\nuse in pornographic representations.Those children who are used in the\nproduction of child pornography are physically abused in its production.Moreover, child pornography threatens the physical and psychological security\nof all children since it can be encountered by any child.”[6]It should be observed that children are\ninitially victimized with the production of the images.However, their\nvictimization endures in perpetuity with the distribution on the internet.As\nthese children age, they come to understand that they will always be victims.Their images can be disseminated worldwide in perpetuity.Anyone can\nrepeatedly view their violation.Their personal dignity is forever destroyed.[7]Given technological advances, child\npornography is capable of easy, inexpensive and discrete production.It can be\nproduced and stored secretly in the privacy of a home.It is difficult to\nferret out and trace.It is complex, expensive and time-consuming to\nprosecute.[8]The images are perpetually devastating\nand the exposure worldwide.This is precisely why denunciation and general\ndeterrence should be the predominant sentencing factors.There should be a\nclear and unequivocal understanding on the part of producers, collectors and\ntraders in these pornographic images that if you are caught you will go to jail\nfor a significant period of time.No other punishment will adequately express\nthe moral culpability for participation in this crime.No other punishment has\na hope of deterring those sexually addicted deviants who deliberately prey upon\nthese young and vulnerable victims.[9]The Court has a duty to impose punitive\nsentences that reflect both society’s values and its duty to protect children\nfrom sexual exploitation.The message that children are not appropriate sexual\npartners must be clear.In fact, this message has been sent by actual jail\nterms in many cases.R. v. Steadman 2001 ABQB 1004 (CanLII), [2001] A.J. No. 1563, R.\nv. Rideout [1998] A.J. No. 199, R. v. Weir [1998] A.J. No. 155, R.\nv. Yaworski [2000] O.J. (Ont. C.A.) No. 2613 and others.[10]Incarceration is the most direct and\neffective way to punish and prevent these most repulsive of predators from\nfurther victimizing innocent children.Although one might wonder if this\napparently worldwide erosion of moral dignity can be contained and dissuaded by\nforce of incarceration alone in those few jurisdictions actually willing to\nlegislate and adjudicate to protect children, one can only hope that Canada and\nits government, of which the judiciary is the third branch, will act as a role\nmodel for the rest of the world and have some small but positive future\ndeterrent impact.[11]The nature of the pictures hoarded by\nMr. Bishop are so gut-wrenchingly disturbing and so depressingly haunting that\nthey cause this observer to pause to wonder just how the moral compass of\nhumanity has gone so far awry.Until one actually views and appreciates the\ndepravity of the images, one cannot adequately understand the impact they might\nhave on both the victims and the consumers.The actual extent of the\nviolations can be described as nothing but being horrific.[12]In the case of R. v. Petcharich\n2001 O.J. No. 3940, Hill, J. at paragraph 18 said:“The\npossessor of child pornography cannot deny contribution to the child abuse of\nthose youths depicted in the pictorial images possessed.Molestation of a\nchild’s innocence and the warping of the morals and values of youth is\ndespicable and deserving of a denunciatory punishment.Others must be deterred\nfrom participating in this crime.”And\nfurther at paragraph 22 he said:“In\naddition to the primacy of denunciation and general deterrence in fashioning a\njust disposition attention, must be paid to the restorative objective of\ntreatment of the offender for the future protection of the public.[13]Again, in R. v. E.O., 2003 CanLII 2017 (ON CA), 2003 O.J.\nNo. 563, Cronk, J.A. said at paragraph 7:“Possession\nof child pornography is a crime of enormous gravity both for the affected\nvictims and for society as a whole.For that reason, the courts have\nrepeatedly recognized that the most important sentencing principles in cases\ninvolving child pornography are general deterrence and denunciation.Further,\nthe offence of possession of child pornography requires the imposition of\nsentences which denounce the morally reprehensible nature of the crime, deters\nothers from the commission of the offence and reflects the gravity of the\noffence.[14]In dealing with child pornography, the\n2007 edition of the Canadian Criminal Code in s. 163.1 provides,\nsubsection (2):“Every\nperson who makes, prints, publishes or possesses for the purposes of\npublication any child pornography is guilty of(a)\nan indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten\nyears and to a minimum punishment of imprisonment for a term of one year; or(b)\nan offence punishable on summary conviction and liable to imprisonment for a\nterm not exceeding eighteen months and to a minimum punishment of imprisonment\nfor a term of ninety days.”Subsection\n(3):“Every\nperson who transmits, makes available, distributes, sells, advertises, imports,\nexports or possesses for the purposes of transmission, making available,\ndistribution, sale, advertising or exportation any child pornography is guilty\nof(a)an indictable offence and\nliable toimprisonment\nfor a term not exceeding ten years and to a minimum punishment of imprisonment\nfor a term of one year; or(b)\nan offence punishable on summary conviction and liable to imprisonment for a\nterm not exceeding eighteen months and to a minimum punishment of imprisonment\nfor a term of ninety days.”Thus, a term of imprisonment is now mandatory\nfor offences of this nature.[15]In R. v. Lea 2004 O.J. No. 6040\n(Ont. C.A.);and in R. v. Yaworski 2000 CanLII 4400 (ON CA), 2000 O.J. No. 2613; and in R. v.\nNeilly 2006 April 21st, (Ont. C.A.), terms of incarceration were\nimposed.There are many more like cases which I have reviewed and considered\nbut, in my judgment, it is not necessary to refer to them as most of them refer\nto the appropriate principles to be applied in cases similar to the case at\nbar.[16]Mr. Bishop is indeed an extremely\nfortunate young man in that firstly the crown proceeded by way of summary\nconviction with respect to each count rather than by proceeding by indictment.Proceeding by indictment would mean that a far more severe sentence would\nlikely be imposed.The second aspect of his good fortune is that\nthe above sections of the current Criminal Code were not in effect at\nthe time he committed these offences.These offences were committed in 2004.It was not until November, 2005 when the Criminal\nCode was amended to provide the legislation relating to child\npornography as I have quoted it above.[17]In 2004 the legislation regarding child\npornography as I have clearly indicated did not make it mandatory that there be\nincarceration or imprisonment.In 2004 the Criminal Code provisions\nregarding child pornography were as follows:“S.\n161.1(3) Every person who transmits, makes available, distributes, sells,\nimports, exports or possesses for the purpose of transmission, making\navailable, distribution, sale or exportation of any child pornography is guilty\nof(a)\nan indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten\nyears; or(b)an offence punishable on\nsummaryconviction.Subsection\n(4) Every person who possesses anychild\npornography is guilty of(a)\nan indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five\nyears; or(b)\nan offence punishable on summary conviction.”[18]In R. v. Lisk 1998 O.J. No. 1456\n(Ont. C.A.) the offender pleaded guilty to charges of\npossession and distribution of child pornography.The trial judge, having\nconsidered the conditional sentence provisions of the Criminal Code,\ndetermined that denunciation and deterrence could not adequately be addressed\nwith a jail sentence served in the community.Mr. Lisk was sentenced to three\nmonths in jail.That sentence was affirmed by the Ontario Court of Appeal.[19]The Supreme Court of Canada in R. v.\nProulx (2000), 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), 140 C.C.C. (3d) 449 provided guidance to trial courts when\nconsidering conditional sentences.The court identified four criteria that a\nsentencing court must consider before deciding to impose a conditional\nsentence.1.The offence is one that\nis not punishable by a minimum term of imprisonment;2.The court must impose a\nterm of imprisonment of less than two years;3.The safety of the\ncommunity would not be endangered by serving the sentence in the community; and4.A conditional sentence\nwould be consistent with the sentencing principles set out in ss. 718 to 718.2\nof the Criminal Code.The Court further affirmed that there was no\npresumption for or against a conditional sentence for particular offences.In considering whether the sentencing\nprinciples of denunciation and deterrence could be reflected in a conditional\nsentence, former Chief Justice Lamer in speaking for the Supreme Court, stated\nat page 492:“A\nconditional sentence can still provide a significant amount of denunciation.This is particularly so when onerous conditions are imposed and the duration of\nthe conditional sentence is extended beyond the duration of the jail sentence\nthat would ordinarily have been imposed in the circumstances.”And\nagain at page 493 he said:“Moreover,\na conditional sentence can provide a significant deterrence if sufficiently\npunitive conditions are imposed and the public is made aware of the severity of\nthese sentences.There is also the possibility of deterrence through the use\nof community service orders.Nevertheless, there may be circumstances in which\nthe need for deterrence will warrant incarceration.This will depend in part\non whether the offence is one in which the effects of incarceration are likely\nto have a real deterrent effect as well as on the circumstances of the\ncommunity in which the offences were committed.”[20]In R. v. Cohen, 2001 CanLII 3862 (ON CA), [2001] O.J. No.\n1606, the Ontario Court of Appeal substituted a conditional sentence of\nfourteen months for a fourteen month jail term imposed at trial on charges of\npossession and distribution of child pornography.The court distinguished Lisk\non the facts.Lisk involved an offender who distributed material in\nexchange for more child pornography.In Cohen, however, the offender\nresponded to invitations by undercover police.Moreover, the Court of Appeal\nfound that the sentencing judge did not have the benefit of the Supreme Court\nof Canada’s decision in Proulx, a decision that affirmed that\nconditional sentences were capable of achieving the sentencing objectives of\ndenunciation and deterrence.[21]In R. v. Schan 2002 CanLII 41613 (ON CA), [2002] O.J. No.\n600, (O.C.A.) dealt with an appeal from a jail sentence imposed for the offence\nof possession of child pornography. The offender had downloaded images from the\ninternet for his own use.He did not distribute them.The offender was\ncooperative and had taken steps to deal with the problems that gave rise to the\ncharge.The Court of Appeal varied the sentence to 18 months imprisonment to\nbe served in the community, stressing that the specific circumstances of this\noffence and this offender made the imposition of a conditional sentence\nappropriate.[22]The Ontario Court of Appeal again\naddressed sentencing in child pornography cases in R. v. Weber,\n2003 CanLII 28579 (ON CA), [2003] O.J. No. 3306.The offender was convicted of three charges of\ndistribution of child pornography and one charge of possession of child\npornography.He was given a fourteen month conditional sentence.The Ontario\nCourt of Appeal affirmed the sentence and the trial judge’s reliance on the\nearlier Court of Appeal decision in Cohen which circumstances were\nsubstantially similar and a fourteen month conditional sentence was imposed.The court reiterated that these types of offences required sentences that\ndenounce the conduct and deter others and that conditional sentences could,\nwith strict conditions, serve these sentencing objectives.[23]In R. v. Yong Jun Kim, 2004 CanLII 32118 (ON CA), [2004]\nO.J. No. 119, a decision again of the Ontario Court of Appeal, the offender was\nsentenced to a nine month conditional sentence on charges of possession and\ndistribution of child pornography.The offender distributed pornographic\nmaterial in exchange for more pornographic material.He had 12,000 images on\nhis server and sent out over 2800 images.The offender was a youthful first\noffender.The court distinguished this case from the Cohen\nand Weber cases where conditional sentences were imposed.The court\nalso referred to its decision in Lisk where the offender distributed\npornographic material in exchange for more pornographic material and where the\noffender was sentenced to a term of imprisonment.In Kim, the court stated that a\nconditional sentence was inappropriate and that a substantial reformatory\nsentence was called for.However, as the offender had served most of his\nconditional sentence and had just recently arranged psychiatric counseling, the\ncourt did not interfere with the sentence.[24]In my review of these cases the\nfollowing principles emerge from the case law:1.Possession and distribution\nof child pornography are very serious offences and can be linked to the harm\noccasioned by the sexual abuse and exploitation of children;2.These types of offences\nrequire a sentence that clearly denunciates the conduct and deters others;3.Jail sentences are\nnecessary to adequately address the sentencing objectives of denunciation and\ndeterrence;4.A conditional sentence\nwith strict conditions can adequately serve the objectives of general\ndeterrence and denunciation and is appropriate for certain offenders;5.The sentencing court must\nbe guided by these principles but each case must be determined bearing in mind\nthe particular circumstances of the offence and the offender.[25]Mr. Bishop has pleaded guilty to\nthese offences and has expressed remorse for his conduct.He cooperated fully\nwith the authorities when the search warrant was executed.He does not have a\ncriminal record.Mr. Bishop has accepted responsibility\nfor his conduct and it is my understanding he is committed to participating in\ncounseling and treatment.To that end, he has attended counseling sessions\nwith Dr. Stewart, a psychiatrist.He has participated in an assessment with\nDr. Langevin and is, I understand, prepared to participate in the Northwestern\nOntario Sexual Behaviour Program.[26]There are a number of aggravating\nfactors however, which I must consider.The number of child pornography and\nchild nudity images seized from Mr. Bishop’s computer was significant.As\nindicated earlier, the availability of these images on the internet perpetuates\nthe savagery of child abuse and child exploitation and the dissemination of\nchild pornography worldwide evidenced by the accessing of Mr. Bishop’s file\nserver and the images on it by Detective Inspector Zito in the United States.[27]The purpose and principles of\nsentencing are set out in, as indicated earlier, in s. 718 of the Criminal\nCode.That section reads as follows:“ The\nfundamental purpose of sentencing isto\ncontribute along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the law and\nthe maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions\nthat have one or more of the following objectives:a)to denounce unlawful\nconduct;b)to deter the offender and\nothers from committing offences;c)to separate offenders\nfrom society where necessary;d)to assist in\nrehabilitating offenders;e)to provide reparations\nfor harm done to victims or to the community; andf)to promote a sense of\nresponsibility in offenders and acknowledgment of the harm done to victims and\nto the community.”S. 718.1 of the Code requires that the\nsentence imposed be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree\nof responsibility of the offender.S. 718.2 of the Code requires the court to\nconsider the following:“1.Any aggravating and mitigating circumstances relating to the offender;2.Sentences should be similar to those imposed in similar circumstances;3.Where consecutive\nsentences are imposed the total should not be unduly long or harsh; and4.Offenders should not be\ndeprived of their liberty if less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate in\nthe circumstances.”[28]Counsel do not agree as to what is an\nappropriate sentence in this case.Accepting their positions the question\nremains whether this is an appropriate case for the jail sentence to be served\nin the community.[29]S. 742.1 of the Criminal Code\nreads as follows:“Where\na person is convicted of an offence, except an offence that is punishable by a\nminimum term of imprisonment and the courta)imposes a sentence of\nimprisonment of less than two years; andb)is satisfied that serving\nthe sentence in the community would not endanger the safety of the community\nand would be consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of\nsentencing set out in ss. 718 to 718.2, the court may for the purpose of\nsupervising the offender’s behaviour in the community, order that the offender\nserve the sentence in the community subject to the offender’s complying with\nthe conditions of a conditional sentence order made under s. 742.3.”As indicated earlier, in 2004 when these\noffences were committed, the Criminal Code did not provide for a minimum\nterm of imprisonment.[30]S. 163.1 of the Criminal Code is\na comprehensive scheme designed to attack child pornography at every step –\nproduction, publication, importation, distribution, sale and possession.It is\na legislative response that reflects the values of our society, values that\nabhor the violence that this material visits on children.[31]The principles that emerge from the\ncase law with respect to sentences for these types of offences clearly place\ndenunciation and deterrence as primary objectives when considering a fit\nsentence.[32]The Ontario Court of Appeal decisions\nin Cohen, Schan and Weber all confirmed or substituted\nconditional jail sentences for child pornography offences.The same court in Lisk\nimposed a jail sentence and in Kim, while not substituting a jail\nsentence for the conditional sentence imposed at trial, stating clearly that a\nconditional sentence was not appropriate in that case.[33]Where then does Mr. Bishop’s case fall\nwithin this spectrum?[34]Sentencing should not be a stiff or\nformulaic exercise.Rather it should be principled, responding to community\ncircumstances and flexible enough to permit the exercise of discretion.While\nss. 718 to 718.2 of the Criminal Code and the case law clearly\narticulate the applicable sentencing principles, they must be read and\nconsidered in light of the particular circumstances of each case and each\noffender.[35]According to the reports ordered by the\ncourt and particularly the report of Dr. Langevin, Ph. D., forensic\npsychologist, Mr. Bishop is not a pedophile but he is homosexual.In reaching\nthis conclusion, Dr. Langevin examined Mr. Biship over a two day period and\nconducted some twenty or more different tests including a phallometric test of\nerotic preference.With respect to this test, Dr. Langevin reported that many\nmen tend to try to manipulate the testing by doing various things but that Mr.\nBishop did not.Dr. Langevin reported:“CJ\ndid not attempt to manipulate the phallometric test in any of the foregoing\nfashions.He denied suffering from impotence or any medical condition which\nmight affect his ability to have an erection.He was highly anxious and\ndepressed but he was responsive nonetheless.Valid information was obtained.He was embarrassed initially when pictures of adult males were shown and he\ntried to check his reactions, but he did this less as the session progressed.The\npedophilia index, a measure of relative attraction to children versus adults\nwas within normal limits.Results indicate androphilia, a sexual attraction to\nadult males.”In the report Mr. Biship advised Dr. Langevin\nthat he was not sexually attracted to children but lived vicariously through\nthem in his fantasies.He told Dr. Langevin that all of his fantasies were of\nbeing like the children in the pictures whom he believed at the time were loved\nand appreciated and he wanted to have bodies like them and be appreciated like\nthem.Dr. Langevin reported that since he has been in therapy he recognizes\nthat he is naïve and that he now realizes that they were not loved nor\nappreciated.Dr. Langevin further reported that Mr. Bishop did not know the\ndifference between sex and love but that he does now and that he regrets his\nuse of the images.Under the heading of Summary and\nRecommendations Dr. Langevin states:“Mr.\nBishop presented as clinically depressed and his emotional state is fragile.In spite of current medication for depression, his symptoms are evident and\nsuicide risk should be monitored by a psychiatrist.He presented a pro-social,\nnon-violent and non-criminal history, but he is the product of a dysfunctional\nfamily in which his father was aggressive and demeaning.He was also harassed\nand teased at school to the extent he sought help from the school counselor but\nhe did not find this helpful.It seems that CJ has incorporated much of the\nabuse from father and peers into his self image, which has contributed to his\npassiveness, depression and self-punishing attitude.He does not abuse alcohol\nor drugs.It seems that neither alcohol nor drugs played a role in the\noffences before the court.He is a man of superior intelligence and gross\nneuropsychological functioning appears normal, but he is emotionally confused,\nalbeit therapy appears to have helped him adjust and should be continued.Mr.\nBishop presents as an androphile, that is, he reported and showed in phallometric\ntesting, a sexual preference for adult males.In current research with my\ncolleagues, child pornography falls into two categories, consumers and\nproducers.Men who use child pornography tend not to act out with children.Some may be pedophiles, who sexually prefer children over adults, and they may\nbe inhibited individuals using the pictures as surrogates for actual partners.Some of these men are unable to relate sexually to preferred adult partners for\nemotional reasons and they may show signs of significant mental illness.It is\nmost often the men who photograph children who tend to be aggressive and have\nan intensive criminal history.Mr. Bishop falls in the first category of child\npornography consumers, that is, he has no history of sexually acting out in\npedophilic ways.Actuarial measures indicate that he is a low risk for future\noffences.His major risk is for suicide and he should continue in therapy to\naddress this problem and his social adjustment to the gay community.Mr.\nBishop’s adjustment to prison would be a difficult one and incarceration likely\nwould lead to the type of abuse to which he has been subjected in the past and\nit would likely increase his depressive symptoms and risk for suicide.Mr.\nBishop is a pleasant albeit frightened young man who has the intellectual and\nemotional capacity to benefit from therapy aimed in particular at dealing with\nhis sexual identity issues and coming to terms with the abuses he has suffered\nin his family and as a person trying to deal with his homosexuality.His\nintellectual functioning indicates he is capable of completing graduate school\nand being productive in society and he should be encouraged to complete his\nstudies.”[36]While I accept the report of Dr.\nLangevin, I am somewhat skeptical about it in that I do not know if Dr.\nLangevin was made aware of the seventh image Mr. Bishop sent to Detective\nInspector Zito in which Mr. Bishop uses his screen name of “Siege”, which image\nwas sent to Joe.jpj the screen name of Detective Inspector Zito.That image\ndepicts a nude boy apparently pre-pubescent lying face down on a bed but on his\nknees, thus raising his anus with his legs spread apart.A nude second male\nappears to be having anal sex with the nude boy.Nor am I aware of whether or not\nDr. Langevin was made aware of the contents of the instant images which Mr.\nBishop had with Detective Inspector Zito.However, as indicated, I am\nnonetheless prepared to accept the Report as is.[37]The pre-sentence report is extremely\nfavourable insofar as Mr. Bishop is concerned.While basically isolated from\nhis abusive father by his own choice, Mr. Bishop has exhibited all of the\nfactors and characteristics of a loving and responsible young adult towards his\nsister, his mother and his grandparents.The report is very clear that Mr.\nBishop’s father was, from a very early age, critical, demeaning and abusive of\nhis son.Despite this, Mr. Bishop has earned the respect and friendship of\nmany who worked with him at Bell Canada during the summers when he was not in school\nand notwithstanding these offences his friends have not abandoned him.He has been assessed to be at low risk for\nre-offending.[38]As indicated several times earlier, in\n2004 these offences did not provide for a minimum term of imprisonment and I am\nsatisfied having read the various reports and taking into account the steps Mr.\nBishop has taken since his conviction, towards rehabilitation, that serving the\nsentence in the community would not endanger the safety of the community and\nwould be consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing\nas set out in s. 718 to s. 718.2 that conditional sentences in this case would\nbe appropriate.Mr. Bishop in my judgment probably is a more than tolerable\nrisk not to re-offend if sentenced to conditional terms of imprisonment.Efforts towards rehabilitation would be entirely retarded by incarceration.During the period since his conviction, Mr. Bishop has demonstrated his ability\nnot only not to re-offend but also to address his underlying problems.[39]I have as part of my judicial\neducation, personally attended at a number of provincial and federal prisons.For example, I have visited Kingston Penitentiary, Joyceville, Collins Bay,\nMaplehurst, Frontenac and others.Having been there and having seen first hand\nthe inside of these penitentiaries I am of the firm view that Mr. Bishop would\nnot be a candidate for survival in such an institution.[40]1.With respect to count 1, namely being in\npossession of child pornography contrary to s. 163.1(4) of the Criminal Code\nthere will be a term of imprisonment of three months to be served in the\ncommunity upon conditions which I shall mention in a moment.2.With respect to\ncount 2, namely again being in possession of child pornography, to wit:\ncomputerized graphic images contrary to s. 163.1(4) of the Criminal Code, there\nwill be a term of imprisonment of six months to be served consecutively and to\nbe served in the community upon conditions which I shall mention in a moment.3.With respect to\ncount 3, namely transmitting child pornography contrary to

Hasan: Sentencing, 8th\nEdition (LexisNexis 2012)Reasons for\njudgment:MITCHELL\nJ.A.:[1]On May 20th, 2014, after entering guilty pleas Joseph Laurie\nDoucette was sentenced to seven years in prison on a charge contrary to s.5(1)\n(trafficking in cocaine) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act\nand seven years concurrent on a charge contrary to s.5(2) (possession of\ncocaine for the purpose of trafficking) of the Controlled Drugs and\nSubstances Act.In addition, the sentencing judge imposed a forfeiture\norder of offence related property, including his car, pursuant to s.16 of the Controlled\nDrugs and Substances Act, a DNA order pursuant to s.487.051 of the Criminal\nCode and a weapons prohibition order pursuant to s.109 of the Criminal\nCode.[2]Doucette appeals only the custodial portion of his sentence.He argues\nthat the sentencing judge failed to give credit in mitigation for his early\nguilty plea and further failed to properly consider the gap principle as, in\nthe appellant’s view,\nthere was a 14 year and two-month gap between offences.He acknowledges that\nhis sentence of seven years is not outside the appropriate range but submits\nthat it should have been reduced to four and a half to five years because of\nthe early guilty plea and the gap principle.[3]The Crown argues that the sentencing judge’s\nreasons outline a pathway and shows that she reached her conclusion after\nproperly assessing all the appropriate principles, factors and issues.A\nsentence of seven years, the Crown suggests takes into consideration all the\nmitigating factors and is a fit sentence which ought not to be disturbed.FACTS[4]In the fall of 2013 Charlottetown police initiated an investigation code\nnamed “Project Clean\nSweep.”They targeted\nseveral separate groups and individuals over a four-month period.They\nutilized the services of an agent to make various purchases.Count 1: Between November 12, 2013 and\nJanuary 28, 2014[5]On November 12, 2013, the agent met Doucette, whom he knew, and\npurchased 16.2 grams of cocaine for $1,100.Later that same day Doucette\nattended the agent’s\nresidence and set up a meeting at which Doucette provided the agent with 29.2\ngrams of cocaine on condition that the agent pay him $1,800. the following\nday.When the agent made the payment, Doucette asked the agent if he wanted\nanother ounce.The agent agreed.Doucette then set up a further meeting that\nday and “fronted” the agent with 30.3 grams\nof cocaine.The agent paid him $1,800. for that cocaine a few days later.[6]On January 28, 2014, the agent purchased a further 29.7 grams of cocaine\nfrom Doucette at a price which was to have been determined later.Count 2: January 30, 2014[7]On January 30th Doucette was arrested and a search warrant\nwas executed at his residence.There the police seized 84 grams of cocaine, 56\noxycodone pills, five cellular phones, two digital scales, an expandable baton\nand $535.75 cash.The Plea[8]Doucette was taken to jail January 30th where he remained\nuntil his first court appearance on February 7th.Notwithstanding\nthat the Crown had yet to make full disclosure, Doucette elected to be tried by\na Provincial Court judge and entered guilty pleas to both counts on that day.The Crown agreed to release Doucette pending the preparation of a pre-sentence\nreport, and the matter was set over for sentencing.The Offender[9]Doucette was 58 years old at the time of the offence.He has a long\ncriminal record containing approximately 27 offences dating back to 1972.His\nrelated record is as follows:DATETHE OFFENCETHE PENALTYOctober 1983s.4(1) Narcotic ControlAct (“NCA”)Five and a half months custodyMay 1992s.3(1) NCA$750. fineJanuary 1994s.4(1) NCA12 months custodyFebruary 1994s.4(1) NCAOne year custodyMay 1995s.48(1) Food and DrugsAct (“FDA”)Two years custodyMay 1995s.50.2(2) FDATwo years concurrentMay 1995s.465 Criminal Codeand s.48(1) FDATwo years concurrentMay 1995s.48(1) FDA18 months consecutiveMay 1995s.465 Criminal Codeand s.48(1) FDA18 months consecutiveOctober 2000s.5(2) Control Drugs andSubstances Act (“CDSA”)30 monthsOctober 2000s.4(1) CDSA2 months concurrentJune 2001s.5(1) CDSA4 years, 8 months with creditfor the equivalent of 28 months pre-sentence custody (equivalent to a 7-yearsentence)September 2003s.8(1) CDSATime served[10]Doucette has three children: two boys born in 1995 and 1998, and a\ndaughter with his current partner born 2013.According to the pre-sentence\nreport, Doucette’s\nfinancially unstable and deprived upbringing was a possible reason for his\nlifestyle decisions.The pre-sentence report prepared for his 2001 conviction\nand the current pre-sentence report both indicate that he sold drugs because he\nwas struggling financially.His used car and car detailing business was slow\nand trafficking cocaine provided much needed cash.STANDARD OF REVIEW[11]The law is very clear that the standard of review appellate courts must\napply in sentencing appeals is based on deference.(R. v. Shropshire,\n1995 CanLII 47 (SCC), [1995] 4 S.C.R. 227; R. v. M.(C.A.), 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500; R.\nv. Proulx, [2000] S.C.C. 5; R. v. Nasogaluak, 2010 SCC 6 (CanLII), [2010] 1\nS.C.R. 206; and R. v. Nunn, 2014 PECA 21 (CanLII).)[12]In R. v. McLean, 2014 PECA 10 (CanLII), this court put the standard\nof review quite succinctly at para.10:[10]Section\n687(1) of the Criminal Code directs that on an appeal against\nsentence, an appellant court is to consider the fitness of the sentence. The\nSupreme Court of Canada has directed that in conducting this review, the applicable\nstandard is based on deference. That approach is taken due to practical\nreasons, including the contextual nature of the sentencing process, the\nindividualized nature of sentencing, and the advantageous position of the trial\njudge (R. v. Bolger, 2013 PECA 9 (CanLII), at para.14). An appellate court\ncan intervene where the sentencing judge makes an error in principle, which\nincludes failing to take into account a relevant factor. As well, an appellate\ncourt can intervene whether or not an error in principle has been committed\nwhere the sentence imposed is clearly excessive or inadequate, demonstrably\nunfit, or a substantial and marked departure from other sentences imposed for\nlike offences by like offenders (R. v. Skerry, 2006 PESCAD 5 (CanLII), at\npara.16, applying R. v. Shropshire, 1995 CanLII 47 (SCC), [1995] 4 S.C.R. 227, and R.\nv. M.(C.A.), 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500). The appellate review for failure to\nconsider a relevant factor is based on the standard of reasonableness, which\ndoes not permit an appellate court to interfere with a sentence simply because\na court of appeal would have weighed the factors differently (R. v.\nNasogaluk, 2010 SCC 6 (CanLII), at para.46).GAP PRINCIPLE[13]I am of the view that even if the sentencing judge failed to adequately\nconsider the gap principle, it is an error of no import.The gap principle is\nreally the converse of the practice of treating more harshly an offence\ncommitted shortly after release from custody.A prior record is an aggravating\nfactor.The more recent and related the prior record, the more aggravating it\nis.A period where the accused lives crime free may be taken into account not\nso much as a mitigating factor, but as ameliorating the negative effects of the\nprior record.Clayton Ruby in his book “Sentencing” quotes at p.391 from Cross\nas follows:Assuming that it is not merely the outcome of lucky non detection\nthe trouble free period shows in these cases that the offender is not a\nprofessional criminal and, therefore, the public needs less protection from\nhim.[14]The gap principle is not codified in the Code nor is it\nset in stone.In this case, there are several factors that mitigate against\ncredit for the gap.The most glaring of which is the fact that Doucette’s 2001 conviction and\nsentence was related to trafficking in cannabis, considered by some to be a\nsoft drug, while the present offence relates to the more serious, more harmful\ndrug, cocaine.It therefore represents not so much a repeat but a step up in\nthe drug world.[15]This cannot be seen as a momentary slip.It is a clear return to criminal\nactivity (R. v. Murray, 2009 BCCA 426 (CanLII)).Count one involved four\nsignificant transactions over a period of two and a half months.Doucette’s motivation, according to\nthe pre-sentence report, was the same in 2001 as it is today; that is, he\nwanted money to support his lifestyle, however modest.When times get tough,\nhe turns to what he knows best and that is trafficking in drugs.[16]The sentencing judge did not buy into defence counsel’s plea that Doucette was\nselling only to the agent as a sort of high end accommodation trafficker.In\nmy view, the sentencing judge was right in not accepting that explanation.Firstly, there was no evidence to that effect; it was merely part of counsel’s summations.Secondly,\nthe items seized in relation to count two seem to put the lie to that claim.Doucette had five cell phones, two digital scales, and 56 oxycodone pills in\naddition to his cocaine.This paraphernalia hardly seems necessary if one is\naccommodating one purchaser only.[17]While Doucette does have a significant gap, it is not, as defence\ncounsel suggests, 14 years and two months.One can only get to that amount of\ntime by including time in custody between his arrest in 1999 and his release\nfrom custody in 2003.He can hardly claim credit for living crime free while\nin prison.[18]It is true that minor offences do not necessarily disentitle one to the\nbenefit of the gap principle.However, I do note parenthetically that Doucette\nwas convicted of one count contrary to s.253 (impaired driving) of the Criminal\nCode in April 2009 (90 days in prison) and one count contrary to\ns.259(4) (driving while disqualified) in March 2010 (60 days in prison).The\nlatter charge indicates a cavalier attitude towards court orders.[19]All in all looking at Doucette’s\nrelated drug record, his motivation, his move to more serious and dangerous\ndrug, it is reasonable to conclude that Doucette is a career drug trafficker\nand indeed he is a criminal from which the public needs protection.In my\nopinion, the sentencing judge made no error in dealing with thegap principle.GUILTY PLEA/PRE-TRIAL CUSTODY[20]There is truth in the old adage that one who pleads not guilty seeks\njustice while one who pleads guilty seeks mercy.Absent good reason, a guilty\nplea must be taken into account in mitigation of sentence (R. v. Macki,\n2001 BCSC 427 (CanLII), at para.55).There are two schools of thought as to why a\nguilty plea is a mitigating factor.The first is that a guilty plea is an\nexpression of remorse and an acceptance of responsibility.The more pragmatic\nrationale is that it saves the justice system the time and expense of a trial.These two rationales were articulated by MacDonald J. in R. v. Bruce\n(1982), 35 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 530 (PEICA), at para.14:A second mitigating factor referred to by the trial judge was\nthat she had pleaded guilty thereby saving a lengthy trial and this could also\nbe taken as a sign of her remorse. Numerous courts have held that a guilty plea\nshould be taken into consideration on a sentencing: R. v. Johnston and\nTremayne, [1970] 4 C.C.C. 64 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Carriere\n(1952), 14 C.R. 391 (Que. C.A.). It has also been stated that a guilty plea\nshould be given less weight where there is such a preponderance of evidence\nagainst the accused that the only reasonable choice or option left open is a\nplea of guilty. R. v. Spiller, [1969] 4 C.C.C. 211 (B.C.C.A.). In\nthe present case the respondent had signed a statement in which she had\nadmitted her guilt and it could be said that her only choice was to plead\nguilty. However, if the rationale for a policy of decreasing sentence where a\nguilty plea had been entered, is based on the consideration of the time saved\nby not having a trial, I am unable to accept the proposition that there should\nbe less weight given to a guilty plea from a person who has been inescapably\ncaught. I would agree with the trial judge that the guilty plea by the\nrespondent should be a mitigating circumstance. ...[21]In my view either or both rationales may be used to justify a reduction\nin sentence.The amount of credit engendered by a guilty plea however depends\non the circumstances of the case.Some courts have held that a guilty plea can\njustify a discount of up to 25 to 33% (R. v. Weiler, 1991 CanLII 2747 (PE SCTD), 1991 CanLII\n2747 (PESCTD)).That does not mean, however, that a guilty plea merits such a\ndiscount in every case (R. v. Lyons, [1991] P.E.I.J. No. 10\n(PEICA)).There may well be cases where there is good reason to grant no\nreduction for a guilty plea.For example, a guilty plea entered at trial after\nthe Crown has called some or all of its case is a recognition of the inevitable\nand not an expression of remorse nor does it save any appreciable time and\nexpense.Such a guilty plea would merit little or no reduction in sentence.[22]Where a reduction in sentence is warranted, it is not simply a matter of\na mathematical calculation.There are many factors to consider including, but\nnot limited to, as the strength of the Crown’s\ncase, the nature of the case, the timing of the guilty plea, whether the guilty\nplea saves a vulnerable victim from testifying, and the circumstances of the\noffender including his criminal record to mention a few.[23]It is also an error in principle for a sentencing judge to fail to give\ncredit for pre-trial custody without good reason (R. v. Summers,\n[2014] 1 SCR 26 (SCC); R. v. Rezaie (1996), 1996 CanLII 1241 (ON CA), 112 CCC (3d) 97\n(Ont.C.A.)).[24]In sentencing Doucette, the sentencing judge stated as follows:I considered the guilty pleas that you have entered in respect\nof these matters at an early opportunity.The acceptance of responsibility and\nthe saving as a result, and as noted, certainly in respect of these matters\nthat is a significant saving.I also consider the fact that you were in\ncustody for a week.That following your guilty pleas, that the Crown and\ndefence agreed to your release such that you have been in the community since\nFebruary 7th able to make arrangements for your family in\nanticipation of the sentence that would be imposed.We are now on the 20th\nof May.Certainly without the Crown consent given your prior record, it’s not obvious that you\nwould have been released from custody, Sir.So, you’ve, you certainly had that benefit.So that\ndoes in some way, has to be considered as well.It certainly was a quid pro\nquo with respect to the guilty plea and the saving, as well as a benefit to\nyou of being able to be out and about for a significant period of time prior to\nthe imposition of sentence.[25]In my view, the foregoing reveals two errors of principle.The first is\nin relation to pretrial custody.A sentencing judge is required to state on\nthe record and on the warrant of committal the amount of time spent in custody,\nthe term of imprisonment that would have been imposed before any credit was\ngranted, the amount of time credited if any, and the sentence imposed\n(s.719(3.3)).Although the sentencing judge indicated that she was taking into\nconsideration time spent in pre-trial custody, she does not appear to have\ngranted him any credit for that time unless she thought the appropriate\nsentence was seven years and two weeks.Not likely.I concede that over the\ncourse of seven years one week in pre-trial custody may not seem like much.However, the liberty of the subject is a most precious right.In the normal\ncourse, Doucette ought to have been credited with a day and a half for each day\nin custody (R. v. Summers, supra).As he was in custody from\nJanuary 30th to February 7th, a total of nine days\ncounting both January 30th and February 7th, he ought to\nhave been granted credit for two weeks.He received no such credit.[26]Secondly, while stating that she took into account his early guilty\nplea, the sentencing judge discounted it by the fact that he was released\npending sentencing.The Crown on appeal suggests that based on the caselaw\nfiled with the sentencing judge she actually concluded that a sentence of nine\nto ten years was appropriate but she reduced it to seven years (i.e. 25 to 33%)\nto give credit for the early guilty plea.However, given the sentencing judge’s own comment that release\npending sentence “certainly\nwas a quid pro quo in respect to the guilty plea and a saving” and in the absence of\nanything on the record to support the suggestion that a longer sentence was\nseen as a benchmark, I cannot but conclude she gave little or no credit to the\nappellant for his early and timely guilty plea.There is no evidence before\nthe sentencing court that the Crown’s\nconsent was in any way a quid pro quo for a guilty plea.There are any\nnumber of reasons why the Crown may have consented including that the Crown may\nhave been of the belief that a court would have released the accused pending\nsentence.In any event, the time spent on release between guilty plea and sentencing\nis, in the circumstances of this case, irrelevant.Sentence[27]Given these errors in principle the court is free to impose the sentence\nwhich it deems fit in the circumstances (R. v. McLean, supra, and\nR. v. Partridge, 2005 NSCA 159 (CanLII)).[28]In this case the Crown was seeking a sentence of seven years.The\ndefence agrees that seven years would be the appropriate sentence but that\nshould have been reduced by virtue of the guilty plea.In my view, the\nsentencing judge took into account the proper factors and principles of\nsentencing with the emphasis on deterrence and denunciation.She properly\nconsidered his previous criminal record, the fact that his motivation was\nfinancial and not the result of any addiction, as well as a scourge that drugs,\nsuch as cocaine, represent in this small province.The sentence of seven years\nbefore taking into account the mitigating factor of a guilty plea was\nreasonable.As to the weight that ought to have been given the guilty plea in\nmitigation, it is important to note that Doucette entered his guilty plea at\ntheearliest possible time.His guilty plea was entered on his first court\nappearance and before he had full disclosure.The appellant gave up his right\nto trial and gave up his right to challenge the evidence of the agent.In so\ndoing, he saved an enormous amount of time and money in terms of police and\ncourt resources in bringing this matter to trial.Nonetheless, his offence is\nvery serious and his involvement in the drug underworld has been life long.[29]Therefore, I would reduce the sentence imposed on the appellant from\nseven years to six years.I would also credit the appellant with two weeks for\ntime served in pretrial custody having the effect of reducing his total sentence\nto five years eleven and a half months.I would affirm all other aspects of\nthe sentence._____________________________________Justice\nJohn K.

Twaddle and Kroft JJ.A.BETWEEN:HER MAJESTY THE QUEENRespondent- and -SHARON JANE PASHE(Accused) AppellantJ.J. Gindin for the AppellantR. A. Saull for the RespondentAppeal heard: December 15, 1994Judgment delivered: February 14, 1995HUBAND J.A.The accused was the foster mother of a\n21-month-old child. She had cared for the child for about three months, in a\nhousehold along with her husband and her own three children.On January 13, 1990 the accused brought the\nfoster child to the hospital at Portage la Prairie by taxi, arriving at 3:50 p.m. She claimed the child had fallen\noff a dresser and was thus rendered unconscious.[Page 2]The child was\ntransferred to a hospital in Winnipeg, but died the following day.Examination of the\nchild revealed physical findings which were inconsistent with the accused's\ninitial explanation. The child had a number of bruises on various parts of the\nanatomy, and in particular around the head, all consistent with having been\nstruck. The cause of death was cerebral hemorrhage.When confronted with\nthis situation the accused acknowledged that she had indeed struck the child on\nthe afternoon in question, and that the child was\nrendered unconscious. The accused said that she then picked up and shook the\nchild in an effort to revive it. When that failed she rushed\nto hospital. No one else was at home at the time.The Crown accepted that\nexplanation. The cause of death is consistent with severe and excessive shaking\nof the child. There is no admission that the accused is responsible for\nstriking the child on any previous occasion.The accused entered a\nplea of guilty to a charge of criminal negligence causing death, with a joint\nrecommendation that the incarcetory term of the sentence should be 12 months'\nimprisonment.The accused is 30 years\nof age. She and her husband have raised their own three children with no\nproblems which have become[Page 3]apparent to a wider community. There has been no\ninvolvement with child care agencies. She has a record of four relatively minor\noffences, none of which involve physical violence. There is no doubt that she\nwas remorseful for what occurred. When the gravity of what she had done became\napparent to her, she acted swiftly in seeking aid for the child. She pleaded\nguilty to a charge which might not have been easily established without her\ncooperation.The learned sentencing judge refused to accept\nthe joint recommendation of counsel. He explained that he could not bring\nhimself \"to accept that a 12-month period of incarceration is a fit\nsentence proportionate to the offence and the offender in question, even with\nfull regard to all the mitigating factors and the plea of guilty.\"He imposed a sentence of two years less a day to\nbe followed by three years supervised probation, the probation being subject to\ncertain conditions.It was acknowledged that the joint\nrecommendation resulted from a plea bargaining between counsel, described by\nthe sentencing judge as experienced and competent. A less serious charge was\nsubstituted for the original charge, and agreement was reached on the sentence\nto be recommended upon a plea of guilty being entered. Plea bargaining has\nbecome a routine part of the process of handling criminal cases. The bargaining\nprocess is undermined if the resulting compromise recommendation is too readily\nrejected by the sentencing judge.[Page 4]The sentencing judge is\nnot bound to accept a recommendation, but it should not be rejected unless\nthere is good cause for doing so. In R. v. Divito (unreported, January 3, 1990) this Court stated that while a sentencing judge has an overriding discretion to\nreject a joint recommendation \"there must be\ngood reason to do so, particularly, as in this case, where the joint\nrecommendation is made by experienced counsel.\" (See also R. v. Kiesman (1991), 75 Man.R. (2d) 314\n(C.A.), and R. v. Walton (unreported, September 23, 1994, Man. C.A.)\nto the same general effect.)The question then\nbecomes whether the learned sentencing judge had good cause to reject the joint\nrecommendation. The sentencing judge thought that the jail term of one year was\nsimply unfit, even as a result of a plea bargain, and that would indeed be\nappropriate grounds for rejecting a joint recommendation. In my view, however,\nthe recommended jail term was within the appropriate range of sentences for\ncriminal negligence causing death, given the surrounding circumstances. While\nshorter than it might have been, it was not unfit.There is a wide range\nof sentencing for the offence of criminal negligence causing death. That charge\nis often brought in motor vehicle cases where the death of some person arises,\nand in cases such as the present one where the death of an infant results from\nnegligence in the provision of care. Clayton C. Ruby, Sentencing (4th\ned. 1994), suggests that the \"established range now appears to be from\nseveral months to eight years' imprisonment\" depending on the\ncircumstances. That conclusion is[Page 5]borne out in the review of decisions across Canada contained in 1 Nadin­Davis and\nSproule (ed.), Canadian Sentencing Digest [1989-1991]. There are several\ncases involving incarceration for a year or less, and one where an infant was\nkilled due to \"shaken infant syndrome\" where sentence was suspended. (R.\nv. Millar, October 4, 1990, Charron J., Ont.Gen.Div.)In my view, it was reasonable for counsel to\nbring the joint recommendation before the Court since the proposed sentence was\nin the appropriate range, albeit towards the lower end. The learned sentencing\njudge therefore did not have good cause to reject the proposed one-year\nsentence. He erred in principle in concluding that one year was unfit and in\nsubstituting a longer period of incarceration.I would allow the appeal, set aside the two-year\nsentence, and impose a sentence of one year. The probation order will remain.[S] J.A.I Agree:[S] J.A.TWADDLE IA,This is a sentence\nappeal in which the accused's only real ground of complaint is the sentencing\njudge's rejection of the plea-bargained recommendation as to sentence made by\nboth counsel. At issue are the circumstances in which a sentencing judge is\nentitled to depart from such a recommendation.Although I personally\ndisapprove of plea-bargaining, where it involves a recommended sentence, I\nrecogni7p it as a practice so ingrained in the Manitoba justice system that any attempt on my part to\ndiscourage it[Page 2]would fare no better\nthan King Canute's attempt to stem the tide. That being so, I accept the\nproposition that a plea-bargained recommendation should not be, in the words of my\nbrother Huband, \"too readily rejected by the sentencing judge.\"In R. v. Simoneau (1978),\n40 C.C.C. (2d) 307 (Man. C.A.), a majority of this Court held that, in the case of a joint\nrecommendation as to sentence where a plea bargain was not involved, the\nsentencing judge retained an overriding discretion to reject the\nrecommendation. I think that is also so where a plea bargain is involved, but\nwith this difference: a plea-bargained recommendation should only be departed\nfrom for good reason. This rule, consistently applied by this Court, maintains a\nproper balance between respect for the plea bargain and the sentencing court's\nrole in the administration of justice.A sentencing judge is\nnot obliged to impose a sentence which he or she thinks\nunfit merely because it is\nrecommended as part of a plea bargain. The judge may impose instead the\nsentence which he or she thinks fit. In doing so, however, the judge should\ngive reasons for thinking the recommended sentence to be unfit so that the\naccused knows why the bargain counsel made is not acceptable to the court. This will most\noften obviate the need for an appeal or, at least, be of assistance to this Court in deciding any\nappeal that might be brought.[Page 3]The difficulty in this case is that, in\ndeparting from the recommended sentence, the sentencing judge failed to\narticulate his reasons for thinking the recommended sentence unfit. He merely\nsaid that he could not bring himself to accept it as a fit one. This may be\nreason enough where the unfitness is clear, but insufficient to satisfy this\nCourt\nin a marginal case.In my own opinion, this was not a marginal case:\nthe recommended sentence was totally unfit. Let me give my reasons.The acknowledged circumstances of the death were\nthese: The accused struck the child once or twice, rendering him unconscious.\nShe then picked up the child and, hoping to revive it, shook the child\nstrenuously. Death resulted from the shaking.If the only culpable act of the accused had her\ncriminally negligent shaking of the child, I would have accepted the one year\nsentence as a fit one. Whilst the violent shaking of a young child is both an\ninappropriate and reckless way to treat such a child, even in the hope of\nreviving him, it is nonetheless an understandable reaction to an event of\nunknown cause. What increases the culpability of this accused, in my opinion,\nis that the child became unconscious as a result of being struck by her. If\nthat had not been so, the criminally negligent shaking of the child would not\nhave occurred. Striking a child with sufficient force to cause unconsciousness\nis of itself, at the minimum, an act of very great[Page 4]negligence indeed. Combined with the subsequent\nshaking, the conduct was of a character which, given the consequence, renders a\none-year term totally unfit.In the result, I would dismiss the accused's\nappeal against sentence.[S] J.A.[ScanLII Collection]"}

Marshall of the Ontario Court of Justice dated September 9,\n2002.E N D O R S E M E N T[1]The respondent pleaded guilty to fraud over\n$5,000 and received a conditional sentence of two years less a day.The Crown\nappeals this sentence and asks that the conditional sentence be set aside and\nthat an appropriate custodial term be imposed.[2]The respondent was employed as the chief\nchiropodist for the University Health Network, which is an association of three\nToronto area hospitals.Between 1996 and 2000, he submitted hundreds of false\ninvoices to his employer, thereby defrauding the hospital system of\napproximately $900,000.In some cases the invoices were inflated, in others\nthey were for non-existent work, and in other cases they were for personal\nexpenses.Each invoice was approved by the respondent and submitted to the\nUniversity Health Network for payment.In many cases the respondent acted in\nconcert with third parties.[1]In March 2000, acting on an anonymous tip, the\nUniversity Health Network conducted an internal audit of the chiropody unit.As a result of this audit, the respondent’s criminal activities were discovered\nand the police were contacted.The respondent was charged with fraud in\nFebruary of 2001.A year later, he gave a detailed statement to the police\nadmitting his involvement in the fraud.[2]We accept the Crown’s submissions that (1) the\ntrial judge over-emphasized the significance of the respondent’s guilty plea;\nand (2) that a conditional sentence is demonstrably unfit in this case for\nthree reasons: (i) it is outside the range of sentence recently approved by\nthis court (we refer to R. v. Bogart (2002), 2002 CanLII 41073 (ON CA), 167 C.C.C. (3d) 390 (Ont.\nC.A.) (leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada denied March 20, 2003)\nand the decisions reviewed in it); (ii) it fails to satisfy the principle of\ngeneral deterrence; and (iii) it is disproportionate to the gravity of the\noffence and the respondent’s degree of responsibility.[3]In Bogart, the facts of which are, in\nmany important respects, strikingly similar to those of this case, Laskin J.A.\non behalf of the court affirmed the principle that cases of large scale fraud\nby persons in a position of trust have generally resulted in substantial\nsentences of imprisonment. At pages 399-400 he said:Both before and\nafter Parliament’s introduction of conditional sentences, cases of large-scale\nfraud by persons in a position of trust have typically resulted in substantial\njail sentences.In his recent judgment in R. v. Dobis (2002), 2002 CanLII 32815 (ON CA), 58 O.R.\n(3d) 536, 163 C.C.C. (3d) 259 (C.A.), my colleague MacPherson J.A. has\nthoroughly reviewed these cases.His review shows that ordinarily these frauds\nmerit a penitentiary sentence in the range of three to five years.Even where\nmitigating considerations have reduced the sentence to the reformatory range, a\njail term, not a sentence served in the community, has usually been imposed.Health care\nprofessionals who defraud provincial health care plans have also normally\nreceived a jail sentence.As this court said in R. v. McCrystal (1992),\n55 O.A.C. 167 at 169, where a doctor defrauded OHIP of nearly $85,000 by\nsubmitting false claims for fees, “[i]t is well-established that, in the\nabsence of special circumstances, a custodial term should be imposed for an\noffence of this nature.”Special circumstances that might justify a conditional sentence for\nOHIP fraud include circumstances where the amount of the fraud is relatively\nsmall, the doctor has made full restitution before sentencing or the doctor can\npoint to exceptional personal circumstances such as ill health or advanced\nage.None of these special circumstances exists here.[4]Neither do special circumstances exist in the\ncase before us.[5]The sentence imposed in this case fails to\nsatisfy the fundamental principles of sentencing particularly in light of\nfactors relating to the seriousness of the offence and the respondent’s moral\nblameworthiness:Seriousness\nof the Offence[6]Fraud over $5,000 is a serious offence\nattracting a maximum penalty of ten years in prison.The quantum of the fraud\nin this case, was, as indicated, around $900,000.The fraud was systematic and\nwell planned, taking place over four years and involving several participants.Were it not for the anonymous tip received by the University Health Network, it\nmight never have been discovered.As a result of the fraud, the University\nHealth Network suffered substantial losses most of which were unrecovered (the\ncivil settlement with the respondent resulted in the recovery of only $150,000,\na small portion of the loss).The respondent also returned computer equipment\nfor which he had arranged for the University Health Network to be invoiced and\nwhich he had used at his home for his personal use.Further, the general\npublic was deprived of resources that could have been put toward important\nmedical services.The\nRespondent’s Moral Blameworthiness[7]This was an extremely serious breach of trust.The respondent was entrusted with the administration of the chiropody\ndepartment at Toronto’s largest hospital, a trust he repeatedly violated over\nan extended period of time.The respondent was motivated by greed.He used\nhis share of the proceeds of his crime to purchase expensive merchandise and\nservices, including a week long trip to Whistler, British Columbia for himself\nand his family.The respondent cooperated with the police and hospital\nofficials only after an audit revealed his fraudulent activities.Although the\nrespondent has made some restitution, the majority of the public funds he\nmisappropriated have not yet been recovered.The respondent enlisted the help\nof his teenage son and two of his son’s friends to commit some of the\nfraudulent acts.This was not only a breach of trust with respect to his\nemployer, but a grave breach of his responsibility as a parent.[8]In the result, the appeal is allowed, the\nsentence is set aside and in its place, we impose a sentence of eighteen months\nimprisonment.A warrant may issue to be exercised in the discretion of the\nCrown.“R.R.\nMcMurtry C.J.O.”“J.W.\nMorden J.A.”“K.\nFeldman J.A.”"}

With respect to count 1 on July 27th at\napproximately 9:30 p.m. he sold one ounce of hashish for $350 to a police\nagent, Mr. Larry Howard. With respect to count two the[Page 2]again sold one ounce of hashish for\nthe same price to Mr. Larry Howard, the police agent, on August 6, 1993. This\nwas part of an overall joint forces operation of police in this area with\nrespect to the drug problem.The\nrepresentations of counsel indicate that there were discussions with respect to\nlarger amounts of drugs. Mr. Stewart has no prior record in the drug trade. He\nis 27 years of age and has plead guilty to the charges brought against him. In\nso far as I am informed he has a good, or at least he has a work record, having\nworked in the past. A letter of recommendation from his former employer has\nbeen introduced into evidence and he was highly regarded in that employment\nlast year with T. Gilliss Sandblasting \u0026 Painting Ltd. and the president of\nthat company has indicated his intention to rehire Mr. Stewart in the coming\nyear depending of course upon work requirements.Counsel\nagree that Mr. Stewart's involvement in these matters is at the low end of the\nscale and counsel have requested the Court to be lenient and have made a joint\nsubmission with respect to sentence. These are serious matters the Act provides\nfor a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. The Courts have stated that a\nprimary consideration in sentence is a matter of deterrence. A message must be\ngiven to the accused and to the general public that this activity is not to be\nrepeated. In the case of The Queen v. Madore 1987, 75 N.B.R. (2nd) 230, the Court stated that other\nfactors must also be considered. At page 232 Mr. Justice Hoyt stated:[Page 3]\"In\nR.\nv. Cormier (1977) 16 N.B.R. (2d) 710; 21 A.P.R. 710, Hughes, C.J.N.B., pointed out\nthat general deterrence was not, however, the only factor to be considered when\nsoft drugs are involved. At page 712 he said:'Where,\nhowever, the offence involves trafficking or possession for the purpose of\ntrafficking of the so called soft drugs such as marijuana and hashish the\ncourts must consider in addition to the deterrent aspects of the sentence other\nmatters such as the extent to which the accused is involved in the illicit\ntrade, his character, background, criminal record if any, mode of life and the\nlikelihood of his rehabilitation.'In my view the former Chief Justice was not suggesting\nthat these additional considerations have equal importance to general\ndeterrence when sentencing for trafficking in soft drugs. He was merely\nreminding us that those factors must also be taken into consideration.\"I\nof course must be cognizant of the seriousness of these offences, that\nparliament has provided for a penalty of up to life imprisonment as a maximum\npenalty, the importance of deterrence is emphasized in all of the cases\ninvolving illicit drugs. I must also however consider the age of the accused,\nhis work record, the fact that he has no prior criminal record in this area\ninvolving drugs, the possibility of rehabilitation and I think I must consider\nhis plea of guilty and the remorse that he has confirmed himself here in court\ntoday. Of course it is essential that a custodial term be imposed as part of\nany[Page 4]sentence and although I consider the\nrecommendation of counsel to be on the low end of the range for sentences\ninvolving trafficking in this drug, the submissions of counsel must be taken\ninto consideration in that I believe they are probably more knowledgeable of\nthe background and the circumstances with respect to this particular case than\nI am. As each case must be taken into consideration\nand the individual\ncircumstances of each case are relevant, I have come to the conclusion that in\nthese circumstances in light of the submissions of counsel, the plea of guilty\nand the other circumstances surrounding the involvement of Mr. Stewart that I will accept the submissions of\ncounsel and impose a sentence of detention for 2 and 1/2 months on each count.\nThe sentences to be served consecutively. I will direct that the accused be\nimprisoned for 2 and 1/2 months on each count. Each sentence is to be served\nconsecutively. In addition I will direct that he be on probation for a period\nof 2 years. During that period of probation he will keep the peace, be of good\nbehaviour and report to the Probation Officer as required. That concludes the\nmatter. We can now adjourn.[S]Thomas\nW.

Greenspan and Seth Weinstein,\nfor the appellantEric Siebenmorgen and Nathan Kruger,\nfor the respondentHeard: July 15, 2014On appeal from the sentence imposed on July\n22, 2011, by Justice R.D. Gordon of the Superior Court of Justice.By\nthe Court:[1]The appellant, a 17-year-old at the time of the\noffences, received a life sentence with eligibility for parole after seven\nyears, for his role in the brutal murder of a 15-year-old girl who wanted to be\nhis girlfriend.[2]He appeals against the imposition of an adult\nsentence.BACKGROUND IN BRIEF[3]The victim accompanied the appellant and his\nolder companion, Kris Lavallee, to a campsite in a remote forest location\noutside of Sudbury.After killing her, the appellant and Lavallee burned her\nbody, dismembered the remains and buried them in an effort to destroy the\nevidence.[4]The victim was missing for over a month before\nher remains were discovered.Due to the condition of the remains, it was\ndifficult to establish a medical cause or the instrumentality of death.[5]The Crown theory at trial was that the appellant\nand Lavallee acted in concert in killing the victim and burning and\ndismembering her corpse.The appellant testified that Lavallee was solely\nresponsible for the offences and that he took no part in them.[6]After deliberating for approximately ten hours\nover two days, the jury convicted the appellant of second degree murder and\noffering an indignity to a dead body.The Crown then brought an application\npursuant to s. 64(1) of the Youth Criminal Justice\nAct, S.C. 2002, c. 1\n(the “YCJA”) to have the appellant sentenced as an adult.[7]Despite a positive pre-sentence report and\npsychiatric assessment which found that the appellant was a low to moderate\nrisk of violence in the future, the trial judge sentenced him as an adult.In\ndoing so, he gave full, thoughtful reasons.[8]At p. 2 of those reasons, the trial judge\nreminded himself that in R. v. D.B., 2008 SCC 25 (CanLII), [2008] 2\nS.C.R. 3, the Supreme Court said that there is a separate legal and sentencing\nregime for young people because they have heightened vulnerability, less\nmaturity, and a reduced capacity for moral judgment, which together entitles\nthem to a presumption of diminished moral blameworthiness or culpability.As a\nresult, the Crown and not the young person has the burden of showing that the\npresumption of diminished moral culpability has been rebutted and the young\nperson is no longer entitled to its protection.[9]He then carefully considered the factors in s.\n72 of the YCJA to determine whether the presumption had been\nrebutted.He concluded that it had and explained why a youth sentence would\nnot be of sufficient length to hold the appellant accountable for his actions.At p. 17 of the reasons he stated:The seriousness of this offence along with the\ncircumstances surrounding it are of concern including, in particular, [the\nappellant’s] involvement in the murder, his involvement in the desecration of\n[the victim’s] remains, and most tellingly, in the detached and indifferent\nmanner in which he continued with his life thereafter.[10]Further, he noted, unlike a youth sentence, an\nadult sentence would come with lifetime supervision following parole, which\nwould ensure that the appellant’s treatment needs “receive long term management\nwell beyond his time in custody” (p. 17).THE FRESH EVIDENCE[11]The appellant introduced fresh evidence on the\nappeal in the form of institutional records.The fresh evidence shows that the\nappellant has continued to make progress in his rehabilitation while serving\nhis sentence, including the completion of a number of correspondence courses.It\nalso includes an updated risk assessment by Dr. Evans which confirms that, as\nat the time of sentencing, the appellant poses a low to moderate risk of\nviolence in the future.The fresh evidence also shows that since the appellant\nhas been moved from a youth facility to an adult provisional facility, he has\nnot received treatment for his mental health issues.It further indicates that\nthe appellant, who was born in Germany and lived there until he was a young\nteenager, may wish to ultimately return to Germany.[12]The Crown filed responding fresh evidence which\nindicates that the appellant is currently housed in a prison wing in which he\nis not completely segregated from other inmates.The evidence also shows that\nthe appellant has repeatedly requested to remain housed in his current area.But for those requests, there is no impediment to his being housed within the\ngeneral inmate population.Furthermore, the appellant’s requests to remain in\nhis current area have impacted on his ability to access programming available\nto inmates within the regular prison population.THE ISSUES[13]The appellant raises two grounds of appeal.He submits\nthat the trial judge:1.mischaracterized the implied factual\nfindings in the jury’s verdict; and2.erred in imposing an adult sentence.ANALYSISDid the trial judge mischaracterize the\nimplied factual findings in the jury verdict?[14]The trial judge held that the implied factual\nfinding from the jury’s verdict for second degree murder was that the appellant\nhad stabbed the victim.The appellant contends that this was speculative\nreasoning on the part of the trial judge as it was not a necessary implication\nof the jury’s verdict.He points to the fact that the jury had been told that\nthere were two possible routes to conviction in this case – that the appellant\nhad stabbed the victim or that he was a party to the assault that led to her\ndeath.[15]On the facts of this case, we do not accept this\nsubmission.The judge was fully alive to his responsibilities in terms of fact\nfinding.At p. 12 of his reasons, he correctly recites the legal principles\ngoverning the fact-finding duties of a trial judge embarking upon a sentencing\nhearing following a jury’s verdict.He noted that because he did not have the\nbenefit of expressed findings of fact, he had to determine the facts that\nreasonably flowed from the jury findings.He refers to R. v. Ferguson,\n2008 SCC 6 (CanLII), [2008] 1 S.C.R. 96, stating that he was bound by the expressed and\nimplied factual implications of the jury’s verdict and where the factual\nimplications are ambiguous, he had to make his own independent determination of\nthe relevant facts.[16]In light of the jury instruction in this case,\na finding of guilt required the jury to conclude that the appellant had\nparticipated in the assault on the victim from which her death ensued, and that\nhis participation was of such a degree that it was a “substantial and integral\ncause of the death”.The jury was also instructed that if they were satisfied\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant and Lavallee had acted in concert,\nthey did not have to determine who, as between the two, struck the fatal blow[17]In the agreed statement of facts filed on this\nappeal, there is an admission by Lavallee, to a fellow musician, that he and\nthe appellant had killed the victim.According to Lavallee, he had started to\nchoke her and the appellant then reached over and stabbed her once.Dr.\nFairgrieve gave evidence that ribs six and seven on the right side of the\nvictim’s body had an indentation and sharp force trauma caused by a metal\nimplement.The insert and orientation of the wound was such that it was from\nthe front of the body to the back.He also identified that thoracic vertebra\nnumber four exhibited sharp force trauma caused by a bladed instrument.[18]As a practical matter, in light of the evidence,\nthe only way in which the jury could have found that the appellant participated\nin the assault to such a degree that it was a substantial and integral cause of\nthe death is if he inflicted at least one stab wound on the victim.Did the trial judge err in imposing an adult\nsentence?[19]The appellant argues that despite the\nseriousness of the offence, an adult sentence was not necessary to achieve the\nobjectives of the YCJA.He contends that his progress by the time of sentencing – as well as his\nprogress since then – demonstrates his motivation to change and his capacity\nfor rehabilitation.He maintains that imposition of the maximum youth\nsentence, in addition to pre-trial custody of over two years, was sufficient to\nhold the appellant accountable.[20]We see no basis on which to interfere with the\ntrial judge’s imposition of an adult sentence.[21]The trial judge’s reasons show a full and\nbalanced assessment of all of the factors set out in s. 72(1) of the YCJA.He identified and considered the practical consequences of imposing an adult\nsentence, rather than a youth sentence.Further, he acknowledged the\nremarkable progress that the appellant had made since the offences and the\nremorse that he had demonstrated.In assessing the appellant’s moral\nculpability, the trial judge expressly took into consideration Dr. Evans’\nevidence regarding the appellant’s history of substance abuse and his diagnosed\nmood order.The trial judge addressed the evidence regarding the appellant’s\nmental condition and identified treatment needs.In this regard, it is to be\nnoted that the trial judge ordered that the appellant be placed in a youth\nfacility until his 21st birthday and then be transferred to an adult provincial\nfacility until the completion of his sentence.[22]However, as explained above, the trial judge\nultimately concluded that a youth sentence would not be of sufficient length to\nhold the appellant accountable for his actions.[23]The fresh evidence, in the main, is confirmative\nof the evidence before the trial judge.It does not alter the balancing which\nthe trial judge undertook in determining that an adult sentence was necessary.As for the fresh evidence indicating that the appellant may wish to ultimately\nreturn to Germany, we accept the Crown’s submission that pursuant to the International\nTransfer of Offenders Act, S.C. 2004, c. 21 and the Convention on the\nTransfer of Sentenced Persons, 21 March 1983, Can. T.S. 1985\nNo. 9 (entered into force 13 May 1985), a mechanism exists for the appellant to\nseek to have Canada and Germany agree to transfer him to Germany to serve the\nremainder of his sentence.DISPOSITION[24]Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.Released: July 21, 2014 (“A.H.”)“Alexandra Hoy\nA.C.J.O.”“E.E.

Proulx, 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61and the companion cases released at the same\ntime as Proulx.A conditional sentence will address both the punitive\nand rehabilitative objectives necessary in this case.Mr. Croteau\npresents as a low risk according to the Offender Risk Management Assessment\nTool.Violence or the actual or threatened use of a weapon formed no part of\nthis offence.Mr. Croteauhas no previous record, and is only 19 years of\nage.He has been successfully maintaining himself away from home so as to\npermit the taking of technical classes since the age of fourteen.He has his\nparents' full support.His plan of rehabilitation, which includes further\nschooling and employment, makes it unlikely that he will re-offend.But for the\nseriousness of the offences which show some planning, deliberation and\npremeditation, the actions in this case may very well have called for a\nsuspended sentence.However, the lengthy term of the conditional sentence\norder is, in our view, proportionate to the degree of the offender's\nculpability.The appeal is\nallowed.The sentence is set aside and a sentence of nine months to be served\nin the community with the usual conditions is imposed.Mr. Croteau is also\nordered to pay restitution in the amount of $1,383.18.The two year probation\norder will remain in place so as to permit Mr. Croteau this amount of time to\npay restitution."}

VealeAppearances:Eric\nMarcouxCounsel\nfor the CrownDonald\nStephen TutinAppearing\non his own behalfREASONS FOR JUDGMENT[1]VEALE\nJ. (Oral):Just for the record in this matter, Mr. Tutin was a doorman at a\nlocal bar and he had a serious altercation with a fellow named Calvin\nLindstrom.They know each other well, as I understand it.Mr. Tutin lost\ncontrol, essentially, and struck Mr. Lindstrom, punched him twice with his\nfist, and flipped him over and dropped him on his head, causing Mr. Lindstrom\nto become unconscious and suffering from a concussion.Mr. Lindstrom also\nrequired seven stitches to close a laceration about an inch and a half long on\nhis scalp.Apparently, these events were captured on a surveillance video.[2]At\nsentencing, to be fair, Mr. Tutin entered a guilty plea, which has to be taken\ninto consideration in these matters, and his counsel recommended to the Court,\nor submitted to the Court, that there should be a 12‑month conditional\nsentence to be served in the community in his home.[3]The\nCrown was seeking either a jail term for that amount or a conditional sentence\nof 16 months, as I understand it.[4]The\ntrial judge apparently takes the position, rather frequently, that if he is\nunable to send an Aboriginal person to jail or feels that he is unable to, then\nhe will not order a conditional sentence but prefers to use the method of a\nsuspended sentence with a probation order.[5]The\nCrown appealed that sentence, rightly so I think, based on the precedents in\nthis jurisdiction and specifically in R. v. Johnson, 2011 YKTC 70 (CanLII), a\ndecision of Justice Gower sitting as a Territorial Court Judge.[6]However, the Crown also feels that it would be\nappropriate in this circumstance, where Mr. Tutin has already served four\nmonths of the probation under the suspended sentence, to essentially agree to a\n12‑month conditional sentence, giving him credit for the four months that\nhe has spent in his suspended sentence on the terms and conditions that were\njust read out and to which I am satisfied that Mr. Tutin fully understands and\nagrees to.[7]I am going to make an order that the appeal -- I\nguess I am going to make it as though we went through the appeal in the sense\nthat it will be a decision on the appeal that there be a conditional sentence\nof 12 months with a four-month credit for the time that Mr. Tutin has already\nserved under a suspended sentence.The conditional sentence will be on the\nterms that have been read out by the Crown and will be typed up and read out to\nMr. Tutin for a signature.I am satisfied that he understands those\nconditions.The first four months will be under house arrest, which means he\ndoes not leave his premises unless he meets the conditions set out in the\nconditional sentence; and the second four months will be done under a curfew\nfrom 10 P.M. to 6 A.M.[8]I am satisfied that that is an appropriate\nsentence in the circumstance.[9]Mr. Tutin, I hope, in all of this, you have\nlearned a good life lesson and will curb your temper in those situations and\nprobably avoid being a doorman and dealing with people you know, although I\nappreciate that is a difficult thing to do in this town because you end up\nknowing everybody at one time or another.[10]Thank you for agreeing to it.The Clerk will\ndraw it up for you and you have to sign it before you leave.I wish you good\nluck.[11]Thank you, Mr. Marcoux.[12]MR.

The Crown, for\nreasons not disclosed to the court, accepted a plea to careless storage of a\nfirearm, which was the least serious charge that Mr. Caranci faced, and\neffectively abandoned the other two more serious charges.[2]The background facts in this matter are set out in my decisions at 2012\nONSC 734 (CanLII), and 2012 ONSC 3470 (CanLII).After those decisions dismissing the motions by\nMr. Caranci for relief, he re-elected the mode of trial and pleaded guilty to\ncareless storage of a firearm.[3]The facts read in by the Crown and accepted by the defence are the\nfollowing:On November 7, 2009 members of the\nYRP Drugs and Vice unit executed a search warrant on the residence of Mr.\nCaranci located at 7 Queensbury Cres., Vaughan.A search warrant was also\nexecuted on the place of business owned and operated by Mr. Caranci, namely the\nSpa at Tiffany’s located at 435 Bowes Road, Vaughan.The warrants were the result of an\ninvestigation into Caranci’s suspected operation of a bawdy house at the\nTiffany’s Spa.During surveillance conducted in the weeks prior to November 7th,\nofficers observed Caranci transfer items from the Spa to his vehicle, a\nBentley, and drive to his residence.This occurred on two occasions. On both\noccasions Caranci entered the garage in his vehicle, and the garage door closed\nbehind him.On November 5th officers\nfrom the surveillance unit observed Mr. Caranci drive a Bentley, with license\nplate BHFP 683, from the area of his residence to the Spa and he entered the\nbusiness on foot.After some time Mr. Caranci exited the Spa and drove the\nvehicle back to his residence.Mr. Caranci parked the vehicle in the garage of\nthe residence.When officers executed the warrant\nat the residence on November 7th, they searched the Bentley, license\nplate BHFP 683, which was parked in the garage.Det. Troung located a .380\ncalibre hand gun, loaded with 5 rounds of ammunition, in the driver’s side door\npanel.The firearm was tested and analysed by a firearms expert from YRP and\ndetermined to be a prohibited firearm.[4]There are additional facts canvassed by counsel. The story was that the\ngun was left in the car by a friend. Mr. Caranci knew the gun was in the car\nbecause his friend called him and told him. The Crown was not able to prove\nthat Mr. Caranci owned the gun, but noted that it was still possession, albeit\nfleeting, since he knew the gun was there Even so, the Crown chose not to\nproceed on the possession charges.The Positions of the Parties[5]Under section 86 of the Code, the maximum sentence for a first\nconviction of careless storage of a firearm is imprisonment for “a term not\nexceeding two years.”The Crown is seeking a custodial sentence of 8 months.[6]The defence submits that the Crown’s proposed sentence would be\ndisproportionate and that, taking all of the relevant factors into account\nunder section 718 of the Criminal Code and the cases, a suspended\nsentence accompanied by probation for two years and 200 hours of community\nservice would be most appropriate.In the alternative, the defence suggests\nthat a conditional sentence between 9 and 12 months would be appropriate.In\nthe further alternative, if the court considers that some jail time should be\nimposed on Mr. Caranci, then the sentence should be 90 days or less.The\ndefence consents to the Crown’s ancillary requests under section 110 of the Criminal\nCode for a weapons prohibition for 10 years, and under section 491 of the Criminal\nCode for a forfeiture of the recovered firearm.Analysis[7]In this\nsection I consider: first, the sentencing principles as they apply to the\noffence; second, the cases; and third, the prospect of a conditional sentence.The Relevant\nSentencing Principles[8]Section 718 of the Criminal Code sets out, among others, the\nfollowing objectives of sentencing:(a)to denounce unlawful conduct;(b)to deter the offender and other persons from committing offences;…(d)to assist in rehabilitating offenders;… and(f)to promote\na sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgment of the harm done to\nvictims and to the community.[9]Section 718.1 provides that: “A sentence must be proportionate to\nthe gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.”Section 718.2 obliges a court to consider whether “a sentence should\nbe increased or reduced to account for any relevant, aggravating or mitigating\ncircumstances relating to the offence or the offender.” It also provides that:“a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for\nsimilar offences committed in similar circumstances.” The Crown’s Cases[10]The\nCrown relies on the decision of R.A. Clark J. in R. v. Dass, [2008] O.J.\nNo. 1161, at paras. 29-31 to emphasize the seriousness of weapons offences in\nthe Greater Toronto Area:29Turning to the firearms offences, they, too, are considered\nquite rightly to be very serious.30In R v. Jarsch, 2007 BCCA 189 (CanLII), [2007] B.C.J. No. 738, (B.C.C.A.), Smith\nJ.A. stated at para. 5 ff.:\"Before sentencing the appellant, the trial\njudge observed that the minimum sentence for possessing a loaded prohibited\nfirearm is one year and the maximum is 10 years, and that the maximum sentence\nfor occupying a motor vehicle with an unauthorized firearm is also 10 years.\nShe noted that before amendments to the Criminal Code in 1998, there was\nno minimum sentence for the first offence I have just mentioned and the maximum\nfor the second was five years. Thus, she stated, Parliament intended by its\namendments that these offences be treated more seriously than they had been\npreviously.Further, she observed that the paramount\nsentencing objectives for these offences are public safety, general and\nspecific deterrence, and denunciation, and that rehabilitation, while\nimportant, is a secondary concern. She noted as well that the essence of these\noffences is the potential for violence and physical harm and that the degree of\nreadiness of the offender for violent action can be an aggravating\nfactor.\"31Likewise, in R v. Danvers, 2005 CanLII 30044 (ON CA), [2005] O.J. No. 3532, (C.A.),\nArmstrong J.A., at paras. 77 ff. stated:\"In conclusion, I fully endorse the\nfollowing comments made by the trial judge in sentencing the appellant:Death by firearms in public places in Toronto\nplague this city and must be deterred, denounced and stopped. Only the\nimposition of exemplary sentences will serve to deter criminals from arming\nthemselves with handguns. In particular, the use of handguns in public places\ncries out for lengthy increased periods of parole ineligibility. Society must\nbe protected from criminals armed with deadly handguns.'There is no question that our courts have to\naddress the principles of denunciation and deterrence for gun related crimes in\nthe strongest possible terms. The possession and use of illegal handguns in the\nGreater Toronto Area is a cause for major concern in the community and must be\naddressed.\"[11]In R.\nv. Fletcher, [2008] O.J. No. 697 (Spies J.) the accused was convicted of a\nnumber of weapons charges, including possession of a loaded restricted firearm,\na loaded prohibited firearm, possession of two firearms knowing that they were\nobtained by the commission of an offence in Canada, and two counts of careless\nstorage.At para. 39, Spies J. said:39I turn then to what is an appropriate sentence in this\ncase. Clearly denunciation and deterrence, both general and specific, given\nthese are firearms convictions, are paramount considerations in this case.\nFirearms, particularly loaded firearms that are immediately ready to be fired,\ncan have only one purpose and that is to commit criminal acts and take the life\nof someone or at least cause one or more persons very serious injury.\nUnfortunately it has become an all too regular occurrence in these courts for\njudges to express society's abhorrence of guns in our community and many judges\nin dealing with the sentencing of those convicted of firearms offences have\ncommented on the serious public safety issues associated with the possession of\nfirearms, particularly in the City of Toronto.[12]Spies J.\nimposed a sentence of imprisonment for a term of two years in relation to the\ncounts for careless storage to run concurrently with a number of five year\nsentences relating to possession.[13]In R.\nv. Ford, [2010] B.C.J. No. 842 (B.C.C.A.), the Court imposed an\neight month sentence for unsafe storage of a firearm concurrent with a number\nof drug offences.[14]The\nCrown also relies on R. v. P.M., 2012 ONCA 162 (CanLII), [2012] O.J. No. 1148.The court imposed a six-month concurrent sentence for weapons offences which\ndealt with three long guns that were not stored safely or registered and a box\nof ammunition. This was, however, a Crown appeal from a global sentence of six\nyears’ imprisonment imposed on guilty pleas to sexual assault, incest, sexual\ninterference, making child pornography, possessing child pornography, and\ncareless storage of a firearm.The Defence Cases[15]The\ndefence relies heavily on the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in R.\nv. Stevens (2011), 2011 ONCA 504 (CanLII), 106 O.R. (3d) 241, [2011] O.J. No. 3164, where Armstrong\nJ.A. said at para. 62:Counsel for the Crown appropriately argues that \"[g]enerally\nspeaking, firearms related offences are serious\". While this court has\noften clearly stated that gun crime is very serious, it is usually in reference\nto gun violence. Gun safety is clearly very important, but the offences of\ncareless storage of firearms and ammunition are far less serious than violent\ncrimes involving guns. The less serious character of these offences is\nreflected in the appellant's sentence, which was a suspended sentence and\ntwelve months probation.[16]The\nCourt of Appeal allowed the appeal, set aside the conviction, and entered\nverdicts of not guilty because of the presence of illegally obtained evidence;\nthese words of Armstrong J.A., while obiter, signal the importance of\ndistinguishing between lesser and more serious gun-related offences.[17]Mr.\nRobbins for the defence referred to a number of cases involving discharges but\nadvised Mr. Caranci was not seeking. He also referred to a number of cases in\nwhich relatively modest fines were imposed, but did not suggest that a fine\nwould be appropriate.[18]Mr.\nRobbins spent some time on cases involving suspended sentences. In my view, the\nseriousness of this offence does not merit a suspended sentence.Such a\nsentence would not accomplish any of the relevant sentencing goals; it would\nnot amount to a denunciation of a gun crime, and it would not serve to deter\nthis offender or other possible offenders from committing offences.In my\nview, even considering the bail conditions that Mr. Caranci had to work\nthrough, the overall sentence would not assist in rehabilitating him or\npromoting a sense of responsibility in him.A suspended sentence would not be\nproportionate to the gravity of the offence.[19]Finally,\nMr. Robbins went over a number of cases in which conditional sentences were\nimposed.The Prospect\nof a Conditional Sentence[20]Section 742.1\nof the Code permits a court to order that an offender serve a sentence\nof imprisonment of less than two years in the community, subject to strict\nconditions, which is known as a conditional sentence, where certain statutory\nprerequisites are met.Those, as identified by the Supreme Court of Canada in R.\nv. Proulx, 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61, at paragraph 46 are:(1)The offender must be convicted of an offence that is not punishable\nby a minimum term of imprisonment;(2)The court must impose a term of imprisonment of less than two years;(3)The safety of the community would not be endangered by the offender\nserving the sentence in the community; and(4)A conditional sentence would be consistent with the fundamental\npurpose and principles of sentencing set out in ss. 718 to 718.2.[21]Mr. Caranci does not have a\ncriminal record. Although I would not describe him as youthful, his\nrehabilitation prospects are reasonable. Accordingly, I am particularly mindful\nof the words of Rosenberg J.A. in R. v. Priest (1996), 1996 CanLII 1381 (ON CA), 30 O.R. (3d) 538,\n110 C.C.C. (3d) 289 at 295, para 20 (C.A.), that “[t]he duty to explore other\ndispositions for a first offender before imposing a custodial sentence is not\nan empty formalism which can be avoided merely by invoking the objective of\ngeneral deterrence.” See also R. v. Stein (1974), 15 C.C.C. (2d) 376, [1974]\nO.J. No. 93 at 377, para 4 (C.A.).In Priest, the court held that the\nprimary objectives of sentencing a first offender are individual deterrence and\nrehabilitation and are best achieved by either a suspended sentence and\nprobation or a very short term of imprisonment.I also am mindful of the\nprovisions of sections 718.2(d) and (e) to the effect that an offender should\nnot be deprived of his liberty where a less restrictive sanction may be\nappropriate and that all other available sanctions other than imprisonment,\nthat are reasonable in the circumstances, should be considered.[22]Before imposing a conditional\nsentence, a judge must determine that there is no minimum term of imprisonment\nfor the offence of which the offender has been found guilty, and must reject\nboth a probationary sentence and a custodial term as inappropriate:see Proulx,\nat paragraph 77.Further, the judge must be satisfied that having the offender\nserve the sentence in the community would not endanger its safety:see Proulx,\nat paragraph 69.If the judge finds that there is a real risk of re-offence,\nincarceration should be imposed.The Conditional\nSentence Cases[23]Mr.\nRobbins cited R. v. Anderson, [2009] O.J. No. 5828 (O.C.J.). The\nconditional sentence in that case was for twenty-two months followed by three\nyears of probation.Maisonneuve J. found the aggravating factors to be the\ntype of drugs that were found, the quantity of drugs, the weapon, the bullets,\nand the combination of both the weapons and the drugs.The Court imposed an\neighteen month sentence to be served in the community.[24]In R.\nv. Bogdan, [2007] M.J. No. 156 (P.C.J.), the Court held at para. 20:20The second criterion is that the court must be satisfied\nthat serving this sentence in the community would not endanger the safety of\nthe community. Despite the circumstances of the offences in this case involving\nweapons and ammunition, and the offender's re-involvement while on judicial\ninterim release, I am nonetheless satisfied that allowing him to serve his\nsentence of imprisonment in the community would not compromise its safety. I\ncome to this conclusion for three reasons. First, while acknowledging the\ninherent dangers of the weapons and ammunition in this case, it is important\nthat none of the weapons were brandished, discharged, or used in any\nintimidating fashion. Second, the offender has no prior criminal record.\nFinally, he has complied with very strict terms of judicial interim release for\na period in excess of one year.In relation to careless storage, possession of a prohibited weapon,\nbreach of recognizance, among a number of offences, the Court imposed a global\ntwelve month sentence of imprisonment to be served in the community.[25]In R.\nv. Canepa, 2011 ONSC 1406 (CanLII), [2011] O.J. No. 924 (S.C.J.), the Court found at para. 10 that\naggravating circumstances included the fact that the gun was loaded and that it\nwas found in conjunction with a small quantity of drugs.Nordheimer J. said at\nparas. 17-18:17I have concluded on balance that a conditional sentence is\nappropriate in this case. Andrew is a young man who made a mistake, admittedly\na serious mistake. However, there is no evidence that he poses any danger to\nthe community that would preclude him from being a candidate to serve his\nsentence in the community. I also consider that a conditional sentence can\nachieve the objectives of denunciation and deterrence and at the same time\nprovide an opportunity for the rehabilitation of Andrew as well as promoting in\nhim a proper sense of the responsibility that he has to our community,\nparticularly in respect of his future conduct. Incarcerating Andrew would not\nadvance these other important sentencing objectives.18In reaching my conclusion I have also taken into account\nthat Andrew was on strict terms of his release pending trial. He has thus\ndemonstrated his willingness and ability to comply with court imposed\nrestrictions on his conduct. I have also taken into account the impact of those\nstrict terms of release in determining the length of the conditional sentence\nthat I consider to be appropriate.[26]In R.\nv. Kerr, 2001 CanLII 21142 (ON CA), [2001] O. J. No. 5085 (C.A.), the Court converted an eighteen\nmonth custodial sentence into eighteen months conditional.The conviction was\nfor three counts of trafficking in heroin and one count of improperly storing a\nfirearm.The appellant was approximately 27 years old at the time of the\nsentencing.[27]Finally,\nin R. v. Waller, [2005] O. J. No. 3610 (O.C.J.), the Court\nimposed a two year conditional sentence for careless use of a firearm.The gun\nwas used by the spouse of the convicted person to commit suicide.Applying the Sentencing\nPrinciples to this Case[28]As\nnoted above, Mr. Caranci was charged with careless storage of a firearm,\ncontrary to section 86(3) of the Criminal Code; possession of a firearm\nwhile not being the holder of a licence permitting such\npossession, contrary to section 91(2) of the Code; and possession of a\nloaded firearm, contrary to section 95(2) of the Code.[29]Superior\nCourt judges are fully alive to the seriousness of firearms charges,\nparticularly in the Greater Toronto Area, which includes this Region. That\nsaid, the Crown, for reasons not disclosed to the court, accepted a plea to\ncareless storage of a firearm, the least serious charge that Mr. Caranci faced,\nand effectively abandoned the other two more serious charges. I make two\nobservations. First, the Crown’s sentencing theory seems to be that the Court\ncan sentence Mr. Caranci as though he had been convicted of the possession\ncharges even though the Crown specifically gave up on those charges and\naccepted a guilty plea to a lesser offence. In my view to do so would be\ncontrary to the Court of Appeal’s decision in R. v. Stevens, since\ncareless storage offences are less serious.[30]Second,\nit is important to be careful in utilizing cases such as those tendered by the\nCrown in which the firearms conviction was coupled with other often\nmore serious offences. I am reluctantto winkle out the specific sentences\nrelated to the gun charges and to assume that they would have been imposed even\nif there had not been convictions on the more serious charges. These cases are\nnot comparable to this case.The Crown has not pointed to a comparable case in\nwhich the Court imposed an eight month custodial sentence; in keeping with\nsection 718.2 of the Code, I must advert to comparable cases.[31]The\ndefence submits that the cases support a conditional sentence. To repeat,\nbefore imposing a conditional sentence, a judge must determine that certain\nprerequisites have been met, as identified by the Supreme Court of Canada in R.\nv. Proulx.[32]I am\nsatisfied that the prerequisites are met in this case: Mr. Caranci has been\nconvicted of an offence that is not punishable by a minimum term of\nimprisonment; the court must impose a term of imprisonment of less than two\nyears; and, in my view the safety of the community would not be endangered by\nMr. Caranci serving the sentence in the community. I am also satisfied that a conditional\nsentence would be consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of\nsentencing.[33]Mr.\nCaranci’s personal circumstances are relevant.He was born on November 19,\n1973, and was 36 at the time of the offence.He is now 39 years of age.He\nhas been married for five years and his wife is now pregnant with their first\nchild.He has significant family support as was evident before me.Mr.\nCaranci operates a landscaping and snow removal business and also does\nconstruction contracting.He has twelve full-time employees.He picks up\nother employees as certain circumstances require.Mr. Robbins filed a number\nof reference letters from business associates of Mr. Caranci from what appear\nto be substantial enterprises.[34]The\nmitigating factors in this case are that Mr. Caranci has pleaded guilty and has\nthereby accepted responsibility for his conduct.He made a personal statement\nexpressing his remorse that I find to be sincere.Mr. Caranci has no prior\ncriminal record. He is gainfully employed.Mr. Caranci complied with the bail\nconditions without incident.[35]An\naggravating factor in this case is that the gun was loaded and ready to fire.On the other hand, the gun was in a locked car and in a locked garage that had\na security system in place, and was relatively secure.[36]The court\nemphasized in Proulx, that sentencing is an individualized process.There is no such thing as a uniform sentence for a particular crime.In\ndetermining a fit sentence, a judge must consider the specific circumstances of\nthe particular offender and his or her offence or offences.[37]There\nis no presumption against conditional sentences for certain types of offences:see Proulx, at paragraph 81.Although there may be circumstances in\nwhich the need for denunciation or deterrence is so pressing that incarceration\nis warranted, a conditional sentence can provide significant denunciation and\ndeterrence, particularly if sufficiently punitive conditions are imposed. A\nconditional sentence has both punitive and rehabilitative objectives.[38]Mr.\nCaranci spent five days in custody.He experienced the negative effects of the\ncharge, including lost contracts, some financial difficulties, and stresses\nwithin his marriage. I am obliged to take into account, in some way, the time\nthat the accused spent on bail under house arrest:R. v. Downes, 2006 CanLII 3957 (ON CA), [2006]\nO.J. No. 555, at para. 41. The bail conditions were relatively strict at the\nbeginning in November 2009 amounting to house arrest, which affected the\napplicant’s ability to earn an income.These conditions were varied after two\nmonths on January 8, 2010, to allow him to work.The work hours were varied on\nMay 14, 2010, to allow him to work from 6:00 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. This confinement\nwent on for about 16 months. The house arrest conditions were finally deleted\non March 30, 2011.I have considered the impact of the brief incarceration\nand the bail conditions on Mr. Caranci in fixing the sentence I impose today.Mr. Caranci will you please stand up?[39]On the\ncharge of careless storage of a firearm, I sentence you to nine months to be\nserved in the community on the following conditions:(i)You are to keep the peace and to be of good\nbehaviour;(ii)You are to appear before the court as and when\nrequired;(iii)You are to report to a supervisor within two\nworking days of today and thereafter when required by and in the manner\ndirected by the supervisor;(iv)You are to remain in the Province of Ontario\nunless written permission to leave the province is obtained from your\nsupervisor or approval is given by the Court;(v)You are to notify your supervisor or the Court\nin advance of any change of name or address and promptly notify your supervisor\nor the Court of any change of employment or occupation;(vi)You are to reside at your family home or at an\naddress approved by your supervisor, and for the first six months of your\nsentence you are to observe a curfew to be in your residence at all times\nexcept for the following purposes: attending work and travelling directly to\nand from job sites relating to employment with your construction and\nlandscaping companies between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 9:30 p.m.; attending\nat a hospital, doctor’s or dental office, and travelling to and from same; andattending religious services in daylight hours and travelling directly to and\nfrom same; and attending to legal obligations related to this conditional\nsentence order.(vii)You are to perform 200 hours of community\nservice work as specified by your supervisor at a rate not less than 15 hours\nper month to be completed to the supervisor’s satisfaction within 9 months.(viii)You are to abstain absolutely from the\npossession and/or consumption of any drugs or other substances prohibited by\nlaw;(ix)You are not to possess any weapons as defined in\nthe Criminal Code;(x)You are not to apply for nor possess a Firearms\nAcquisition Certificate or any other form gun licence.[40]In the\ninterest of public safety I issue an order under section 110 of the Criminal\nCode prohibiting you from possessing weapons for a period of ten years.I\nalso order forfeiture of the firearm and the ammunition seized to the Attorney\nGeneral of Ontario for disposition as directed by him.[41]Mr.\nCaranci, you should understand that if you breach any of the terms of\nyour conditional sentence, you will be brought back before the Court, with the\nvery good likelihood that you will be required to spend some or all of the\nbalance of your sentence in custody._____________________________P.D.

Clunas\n(1992), 1992 CanLII 127 (SCC), 70 C.C.C. (3d) 115 (SCC).Having regard for the reasons for judgment\nin that case, and the circumstances of the present case, we are all of the view\nthe convictions must stand.To begin with, the accused was represented by\nexperienced and able trial counsel, who in effect consented to the impugned\nprocedure. While counsel did not expressly consent, he is to be taken as having\nimplicitly done so, judging from the record as a whole.Not only that, no\nprejudice befell the accused as a result of the procedure that was employed.[3]The second issue is whether the\ntwo convictions for possession for the purpose of trafficking are unreasonable\nor unsupported by the evidence.This issue is governed in principle by R.\nv. Yebes, 1987 CanLII 17 (SCC), [1987] 2 S.C.R. 168 and R. v. Biniaris, 2000 SCC 15 (CanLII), [2000] 1\nS.C.R. 381.In light of the evidence as a whole, we are unable to say that a\njury, properly instructed and acting judicially, could not reasonably have\narrived at the two guilty verdicts.The trial judge, we might add, addressed\nthe case with care and made careful findings of fact as demonstrated by his\nhaving acquitted the accused on some counts and convicted him on others.[4]That brings us to the third\nissue: whether the conviction for participating in the activities of a criminal\norganization for the purpose alleged in the information is unreasonable or\nunsupported by the evidence. Again, this is largely driven in principle by R.\nv. Yebes and R. v. Biniaris.The trial judge came to his\nconclusion on the basis of inference drawn from the whole of the evidence and\nhis findings of primary fact.In our judgment, there was sufficient in this to\nsupport the inference and hence the conviction.[5]Accordingly, we have decided to\ndismiss the appeal against conviction.[6]That leaves the sentences, the\nfirst of which fall to be reviewed on the standards set forth in such cases as R.\nv. M.(C.A.), 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500.In all of the circumstances,\nincluding the personal circumstances of the appellant, a sentence of two years\non each count, to be served concurrently, is not demonstrably unfit on our view\nthe matter.Nor does the fact the appellant served considerable time on\nremand, having been charged with these and other offences, serve to alter our\nview. The appellant has a substantial criminal record, one that suggests\nspecific deterrence was among the primary objectives of the sentence.So was\ndenunciation, given the nature of the offences and the conduct of the appellant.[7]As for the consecutive sentence\nof three years imposed in relation to theappellant’s participation in a\ncriminal organization, we are again of the view this is not a demonstrably\nunfit sentence.It had to be made consecutive, and a three year term is within\nthe range, given the circumstances and the nature of the offence.Nor do we\nsee any error in the trial judge having decided to direct that the appellant\nnot be eligible for parole before serving half the sentence. We are of the view\nthis was justifiable on the basis of R. v. Zinck, 2003 SCC 6 (CanLII), [2003] 1 S.C.R.\n41.[8]The appellant’s lengthy record\nand long-standing criminal lifestyle are increasingly catching up to him.In\npart, that is what these sentences reflect, aimed as they primarily are at\nspecific deterrence and denunciation.His present offences are serious ones,\nand they are tied to a serious problem in some parts of Regina: trafficking in\ndrugs by individuals and organizations bent on profiting from the weaknesses of\nothers, and wilfully blind to the destructive social consequences.[9]On the whole, then, the appeal\nis dismissed."}

The appellant\ninflicted a cut to the victim's throat with a knife and he stabbed her in the\nchest.[2] We admitted fresh evidence which disclosed that the appellant had little\nremorse for the offence. The appellant who was nineteen years of age at the\ntime of the offence is an aboriginal Canadian. He argues that the trial judge\nerred in failing to give due consideration to s. 718.2(e) of the Criminal Code.\nWe disagree.

(3d) 385 (S.C.C.) at para. 79, the Supreme\nCourt pointed out:Generally the more violent and serious the offence, the more\nlikely it is as a practical reality that the terms of imprisonment for\naboriginals and non-aboriginals would be close to each other or the same, even\ntaking into account the different concepts of sentencing.[3] There is nothing in this record that would lead us to impose a sentence\nfor this serious offence that is less than what is a fit sentence for a\nnon-aboriginal offender.

Nov. 10, 1978) pled guilty on August 31, 1994 to\nfour counts of auto theft (s. 334(a) of the Code), one charge of possession\nover(s. 355(a) of the Code)and one count of escape lawful custody (s.\n145(a) of the Code).One auto offence occurred on June 1, two occurred on June\n2, and the fourth on June 3.A fifth offence occurred on August 14, 1994 while\nhe was unlawfully at large.[S.B.]'s record began on March 19, 1992 with a s. 430(4)\nmischief charge which was dismissed into the diversion program.His next\noffence resulted in a guilty plea on April 28, 1992 to a s. 334(b) theft charge\nfor which he received eight months probation.On May 7, 1992 he pled guilty to\na s. 266 assault and received 15 months probation.Then on May 17, 1993, he\npled guilty to a s. 355(b) possession of stolen goods charge and a s. 26 YOA\nbreach receiving in total eighteen months probation.On March 4, 1994, [S.B.] pled guilty to one count of auto\ntheft (s. 344(a) of the Code), five infractions of s. 26 of the YOA and three\ncounts of failing to comply (s. 145(3) of the Code) for which he received nine\nmonths open custody.On May 1, he escaped from the Kenosee Youth camp where he\nhad been placed for his nine months open custody disposition and committed the\nfirst four auto thefts mentioned above.He was apprehended June 4, 1994.For that\nescape, he received eight weeks' secure custody ending July 28, 1994.He was\nagain transferred to open custody to continue serving his nine months\ndisposition.He escaped again on July 30 resulting in the s. 145(a) offence\npresently before the Court and committed the fifth auto offence.What all this means is that [S.B.] committed all the offences\nwhich are presently before this Court while he was unlawfully at large and\nshould have been serving a disposition that had already been imposed.It also means\nthat when [S.B.] was in Youth Court on August 31, 1994 for the five auto thefts\nand the breach of undertaking, it was his seventh time before the youth court\nto receive a disposition.With respect to the auto offences before the Court, [S.B.]\nand others gained entry to the cars by breaking a window and gained access to\nthe ignition by smashing the steering column.In one case, they slashed\nseats. In other cases, the cars' contents were stolen.Three of the cars were\ninvolved in accidents.Damages varied in amounts from $2,000 where a window\nand the steering column were damaged to $4,300 for one car that was involved in\nan accident.As to his home life, [S.B.]'s parents have been separated for\nsome time.He is the second of three children.The eldest son has also been\ninvolved in the YOA system.[S.B.]'s problems began in the summer of 1992.He had\ntrouble at school.He was described as disruptive and confrontational.He has\nnot been in school since May, 1993.The predisposition report said \"[S.B.] has been unable\nto follow through with the conditions or expectations of custody facilities or\ncourt orders\".It was his worker's opinion that [S.B.] should serve a\nmoderate period of secure custody over and above what was currently remaining\nfrom his open custody disposition.At the sentencing hearing, [S.B.]'s attitude in relation to\nthese offences was that he was \"technically guilty\" because he was\npresent when some or all of the cars were stolen and he drove them.([S.B.]'s\ncounsel said he had not smashed windows or broken steering columns but had been\nthe driver.)[S.B.] still does not understand how his presence with the other\nyouths supported what they were doing and shows little remorse.On August 31, 1994, [S.B.] was sentenced for the offences\nthat are before this Court to six months secure custody consecutive to the nine\nmonths open custody.By the terms of the YOA, the secure custody will be\nserved before he serves the balance of his open custody disposition.At the\nhearing of the appeal we asked for an update on all the youths concerned in\nthis case.We have now received that update.[S.B.]'s report is not good. He\nis working at only a grade six level and lacks motivation and concentration.It is said he shows little commitment to working on problem areas.2.\n[C.J.][C.J.] (b.d. April 20, 1977) pled guilty on May 30, 1994 to\nseven counts of auto theft, three counts of possession of autos knowing they\nwere stolen and one count of breaching an undertaking.The offences were committed\nover two periods.The first series of offences was committed on four nights in\nlate November and December. (On one night two cars were stolen.)He was\narrested in February and released on his own undertaking when he committed the\ntwo remaining offences.An aggravating feature of all the offences was the\nmalicious damage done to the vehicles including slashing seats and driving one\ncar into a wire fence.Damages of this type totaled $31,500.00.When the offences were committed, [C.J.] was living at home\nand in grade nine.His parents knew he was having difficulty adjusting to high\nschool, but knew nothing of the trouble their son was in until apprehended the\nfirst time.He had no criminal record.The predisposition report did not recommend custody, but\nrecommendedprobation on terms.After spending three days on remand, [C.J.] was sentenced to\n18 months probation and 100 hours community service work.Since being sentenced on May 30, 1994, there appears to have\nbeen an almost complete conversion.When he is not at school, another family\nmember is with [C.J.] providing schooling instruction and recreational\nactivities.His parents report [C.J.] is ashamed of his behaviour and\ngenuinely remorseful.He completed his community service in record time.He\nhas continued to have some difficulty with school but has perfect attendance\nand is improving reading and writing skills with which he struggles.His youth\nworker advised the Court that [C.J.]' parents \"offer their son a high\nlevel of support.... and have dealt with [C.J.]' behaviour in an appropriate\nand consistent manner\".With commendable candour, [C.J.]'s counsel\nadvised the Court that [C.J.] was suspended from school for being involved in a\npushing match but was immediately readmitted.His youth worker did not treat\nthis incident as significant.3.\n[T.D.][T.D.] (b.d July 19, 1979) pled guilty to 17 auto thefts, two\nattempted auto thefts and one failure to comply with the terms of an\nundertaking.Prior to these offences, he had no record.The timing of the offences went like this.[T.D.] was enroled\nin Grade 8 for the 1993-94 school year.He was disruptive in school, but not\nabusive and attended regularly.He lived with his mother and stepfather. (His\nnatural father passed away when he was seven years old.) He was having trouble\nat home stemming from anger felt towards his stepfather and was often away,\ncontrary to his parents' wishes, nights and weekends.He committed the first auto theft on January 2, 1994. The\nsecond was committed on April 5.On April 6 he and three other youths\nattempted to steal one vehicle and were successful in stealing four others, one\nafter the other. The group was ultimately apprehended when the police found\nthem asleep in the fourth stolen vehicle.[T.D.] was granted judicial interim\nrelease and then proceeded to steal or attempt to steal cars during the nights\nof April 30, May 1 (two cars), May 2, May 13, May 14 (two cars), May 15 (two\ncars), May 18, May 21, and May 22.[T.D.] was the sole person charged with the\noffences committed on the nights of April 5, May 13, 14, 18 and 22.The other\noffences involved one, two or three other young offenders with J.M. being the\nconstant.The damages to the 17 vehicles was approximately $30,000 in total.Articles missing from the various vehicles were valued at $5,000. When [T.D.]\nwas ultimately apprehended, he co-operated with the police.Custody was not recommended in the predisposition report, but\nthe youth court judge decided a custodial disposition was in order because of\nincreases in such crimes and sentenced him, on June 24, 1994, to eight months\nopen custody and 12 months probation.At this point he had been on remand for\nthree weeks.On July 21, 1994, he escaped open custody and was sentenced to 21\ndays' secure custody.Since then and until recently [T.D.] has been a model student\nand presented few problems to his open custody facility.In September, he\nreceived the student of the month award.However, since this appeal was heard,\n[T.D.] was implicated, as a major player, in an attempted escape from open\ncustody and placed in secure custody.His youth worker advised the court\n\"given [T.D.]'s recent actions, it is difficult to determine the impact of\nhis present disposition or whether [T.D.] totally comprehends the severity of\nhis offences\".4.\n[R.M.][R.M.] (b.d. Aug. 9, 1979) pled guilty to six counts of auto\ntheft.The first four offences occurred during the night of April 6, 1994 when\n[R.M.] was with [T.D.] and three other youths.It appears this was the first\noccasion [R.M.] had consumed alcoholic beverages.He was found passed out with\nthe other youths in one of the stolen vehicles.(This event is described above\nin relation to [T.D.])The total damage to the four vehicles was $8,000.00.[R.M.] pled guilty and was awaiting sentencing when he committed the remaining\ntwo offences.On May 22, [R.M.] and [T.D.] stole a car in Regina, drove to Watrous\nand rolled the car.Twelve hundred dollars' worth of damages was caused to the\nvehicle.On May 24, 1994 [R.M.] and [T.D.] again stole a car, this time from\nSaskatoon and drove to Calgary. The car was recovered near Calgary.No\nestimate of damages was provided.Prior to these offences, [R.M.] was not experiencing\ndifficulties at home or at school.He was in Grade 10 in a modified education\nprogram at the time the offences were committed.His mother was shocked at\nthese offences as there had been no prior warning.Both [R.M.] and his mother\nindicated he had no prior experience with alcohol or drugs.He did not have a\ncriminal record.The predisposition report did not recommend a custodial\ndisposition.After spending two weeks on remand, [R.M.] received a\ndisposition of 18 months probation and 100 hours community service work.The\ndisposition was imposed July 27, 1994.Within three weeks of receiving his disposition, [R.M.] was\ncharged with additional offences arising out of another drinking spree which\noccurred the night before his birthday.His attendance at school has been poor\nthis fall.It is his youth worker's opinion that [R.M.] has made very little\npositive progress since the disposition in July.II.\nGeneral Principles of LawSection 687(1) of the Criminal Code (made applicable by s.\n27(1) of the Young Offenders Act) describes this Court's role:687.(1)Where an\nappeal is taken against sentence, the court of appeal shall, unless the\nsentence is one fixed by law, consider the fitness of the sentence appealed\nagainst, and may on such evidence, if any, as it thinks fit to require or to receive,(a)vary the sentence\nwithin the limits prescribed by law for the offence of which the accused was\nconvicted; or(b)dismiss the appeal.Thus\nour task is to consider whether the sentences (called \"dispositions\"\nunder the YOA) are \"fit\".Over the years the courts in this and the\nother provinces have developed principles and guidelines to assist in\ndetermining whether a disposition is fit.R. v. Morrissette (1971), 1970 CanLII 642 (SK CA), 1 C.C.C. (2d) 307 (Sask. C.A.) is\noften cited for its review of the factors to be considered in sentencing: (i)\npunishment; (ii) deterrence;(iii) protection of the public; and (iv) the\nreformation and rehabilitation of the offender.Morrissette, in addition to\nimposing a sentence for an adult offender, also set a sentence for a 17-year-old\nand 18-year-old.Culliton J.A. said (at p. 311) in relation to young offenders\n\"the principal element for consideration, consonant with the maintenance\nof public confidence in the effective enforcement of the criminal law, should\nbe the offender's reformation and rehabilitation\".The Young Offenders Act became law in Canada on April 2, 1984\nand replaced the Juvenile Delinquents Act which had been the vehicle for\ndealing with youth crime since 1908.The YOA effected a number of changes\nincluding raising the upper age limit for persons covered by the Act to 18, but\nits most fundamental change is the attitude towards punishing offenders.The\nYOA makes the justice system for young offenders more like that for adults.It\nis a more open system.Consideration must be given to the age of the young\noffender, but it is becoming clear that dispositions for young offenders will\nbe as long as they were under the JDA, and in some instances longer, if the\nbalancing of principles and factors, applicable to a particular case, dictate\nthat result.The YOA requires a court when it fashions a disposition to\nbalance the principles set out in s. 3 of the YOA.The parts material to this\ncase are:3.(1)It is hereby recognized and declared that(a)while young persons should not in all instances be held\naccountable in the same manner or suffer the same consequences for their behaviour\nas adults, young persons who commit offences should nonetheless bear\nresponsibility for their contraventions;(b)society must, although it has the responsibility to take\nreasonable measures to prevent criminal conduct by young persons, be afforded\nthe necessary protection from illegal behaviour;(c) young persons who commit offences require supervision,\ndiscipline and control, but, because of their state of dependency and level of\ndevelopment and maturity, they also have special needs and require guidance and\nassistance;...(f) in the application of this Act, the rights and freedoms\nof young persons include a right to the least possible interference with\nfreedom that is consistent with the protection of society, having regard to the\nneeds of young persons and the interests of their families;...(h) parents have\nresponsibility for the care and supervision of their children, and, for that\nreason, young persons should be removed from parental supervision either partly\nor entirely only when measures that provide for continuing parental supervision\nare inappropriate.These\nprovisions are to be given the force normally attributed to substantive\nprovisions:see R. v. T.(V), 1992 CanLII 88 (SCC), [1992] 1 S.C.R. 749 at 765 and R. v. M.(J.J.),\n1993 CanLII 91 (SCC), [1993] 2 S.C.R. 421 at 428.This latter case, which Mr. Justice Cory wrote for the\nSupreme Court of Canada, is of paramount importance in the case before this\nCourt in explaining and elucidating the provisions of the YOA.He confirmed\nthat one goal of the YOA is to protect society from the violent and criminal\nacts committed by the young as much as from those committed by adults, but that\nthis must be balanced against the fact that young people are not fully formed\nin their emotions or reasoning processes and that the possibility of\nrehabilitation is great.He said (at pp. 428 \u0026 429):...The references to\nresponsibility contained in s. 3(1)(a) and to the protection of society in paras.\n(b), (d) and (f) suggest that a traditional criminal law approach should be\ntaken into account in the sentencing of young offenders. Yet we must approach\ndispositions imposed on young offenders differently because the needs and\nrequirements of the young are distinct from those of adults.For instance, the\ndeclaration in s. 3(1)(a) and (c) notes that young offenders cannot be held\naccountable in the same way as adult criminals because of their dependency on\nothers and their obvious lack of maturity.There are other elements in the\ndeclaration which suggest that there should be a departure from the strict\ncriminal justice model in imposing penalties on young offenders.Section\n3(1)(d) for example, suggests that in some circumstances, no judicial measure\nshould be taken against the child.Paragraph (f) confirms the offender's right\nto the least possible interference with his or her liberty.As well, s.\n3(1)(h) establishes that young people coming within the provisions of the Act\nare wherever possible, to remain under parental supervision._He\nexpressed his concern that whatever disposition is chosen must be with the view\nto ensuring young offenders do not become long term adult offenders (see p.\n429).Section 3(1)(h) of the YOA provides that \"parents have\nresponsibility for the care and supervision of their children, and, for that\nreason, young persons should be removed from parental supervision either partly\nor entirely only when measures that provide for continuing parental supervision\nare inappropriate\".Cory J. in R. v. M.(J.J.) said this in relation to a\nyoung offender's home situation (see p. 432):...the home situation is a\nfactor that should always be taken into account in fashioning the appropriate\ndisposition.It is relevant in complying with the Act's requirement that an\nassessment must be made of the special needs and requirements for guidance of\nthe young offender.Intolerable conditions in the home indicate both a special\nneed for care and the absence of any guidance within the home.The situation in the\nhome of young offender should neither be ignored nor made the predominant\nfactor in sentencing. Nonetheless, it is a factor that can properly be taken\ninto account in fashioning the disposition.He\ncompleted this thought later (at p. 433):The aim must be both to\nprotect society and at the same time to provide the young offender with the\nnecessary guidance and assistance that he or she may not be getting at home.Those goals are not necessarily mutually exclusive.In the long run, society\nis best protected by the reformation and rehabilitation of a young offender.The other section of the\nYOA relevant to this case is s. 24(1):24. (1)The youth court\nshall not commit a young person to custody under paragraph 20(1)(k) unless the\ncourt considers a committal to custody to be necessary for the protection of\nsociety having regard to the seriousness of the offence and the circumstances\nin which it was committed and having regard to the needs and circumstances of\nthe young person.In\ndeciding whether society can be protected one weighs the seriousness and the\ncircumstances of the offence with the nature of the offender as a measure of\ndetermining the likelihood of the offender re-offending.R. v. J.R.S. (an unreported judgment of the British Columbia\nCourt of Appeal, dated May 1,1994) applies this principle.In this case a\n17-year-old with a record had pled guilty to one count of breaking and\nentering, two counts of possession of stolen property and two counts of theft\nand received a disposition of 45 days' open custody and one year probation.After reviewing the youth's difficult home situation, McEachern, C.J.B.C.,\nspeaking for the Court, set aside the disposition and impose done of time\nserved.He said:The policy of the Young\nOffenders Act is wherever possible to treat these matters in the community and\nwithout a custodial sentence.If there was a primary consideration that should\nhave appeared in the reasons for judgment of the trial judge it is this\nquestion of rehabilitation which is really the most important consideration\nwith most young offenders.In\ndoing so McEachern, C.J.B.C. doubted whether a custodial disposition had been\nrequired.A Youth Court judge must consider and balance many factors to\narrive at a disposition which will have the best chance of achieving the goals\nalready stated, i.e., rehabilitation of the offender and protection of the\npublic from these and other like minded offenders.A balancing is required\nbecause some factors call for a custodial sentence and some dictate a community\ndisposition.All this must take place in the context of s. 3 which directs the\nCourt to consider, among other things: (i) youths must take responsibility for\ntheir wrongful acts; (ii) parents have responsibility for supervising their\nchildren; and (iii) society must take responsibility but has the right to be\nprotected.Finding how best to supervise, discipline, guide, assist and\ncontrol while at the same time protecting society is no easy task.In doing all this, clearly the Youth Court and this Court\nhave the power to impose lengthy custodial dispositions, but we must do so in a\nmeasured way responding to the dictates of the YOA and our own experience in\ndealing with offenders.We must consider the guiding principles and the\ndifferent factors applicable to each offence and each offender trying all the\nwhile to choose a disposition which will have the most success in ensuring a\nyoung offender will not re-offend.A custodial disposition, no matter how\nlong, is no guarantee the youth will not re-offend when released, and may, if\nnot appropriate for a particular offender, have the exact opposite effect.Furthermore, if the Courts unthinkingly imposed significant custodial sentences\non young offenders, the facilities would be so overburdened as to be of little\nuse for those truly needing that method of correction.One is also mindful\nthat dispositions are rough tools in the fight against youth crime.What are the relevant factors to be balanced in this case?The factors calling for a custodial sentence are the sheer wanton destruction\nof these acts, their frequency, the \"craze\" aspect of the offences\nand, in [S.B.]'s case, the extent of his record.In addition, in each case,\nsome offences were committed while the youth was out of custody on his own\nundertaking.The factors to be considered on the other side are the very young\nage of two offenders, the absence of a record for three of them and that one\nhelped the police with their inquiries.In addition, they all pled guilty.One has done better than others since being dealt with in youth court.It is\nappropriate to consider these factors at greater length to determine what role\neach should play in assessing the fitness of these dispositions.A.Presence or Absence of a RecordA well accepted principle dictates that, if at all possible,\nimprisonment is to be avoided for first offenders.Culliton J.A. said this in Morrissette\nand it has been said many times before and since.The reason for this is that\nthe person has not yet had the opportunity to be confronted with the full force\nof the law.In R. v. Biron (1991), 1991 CanLII 3911 (QC CA), 65 C.C.C. (3d) 221 (Que. C.A.), the\ncharge was one of auto theft.The accused, a successful businessman who was\nfinancially well-off, arranged for someone to steal a luxury car for his\npersonal use.The accused put the Crown to the expense of a jury trial, but,\nnonetheless, the Court said the appropriate sentence was a large fine and a\none-year probation order. Kaufman J.A. said (at p.223):It is now, I think,\naccepted as a general principle of sentencing that before imposing a custodial\nsentence on a first offender, a sentencing court should carefully explore the\nother dispositions available.A custodial sentence should only be imposed in\ncases where the circumstances are such or the gravity of the offence is such\nthat no other sentence is appropriate: R. v. Stein (1974), 15 C.C.C. (2d) 376\n(Ont. C.A.); R. v. Bates (1977), 32 C.C.C.(2d) 493 (Ont. C.A.).(See also: R. v. Stein\n(1974) 15 C.C.C. (2d) 376 (Ont. C.A.) at 377.)This principle is equally applicable to young offenders.In\nR. v. Beacon and Modney (1976), 31 C.C.C. (2d) 56 (Alta. S.C.A.D.) at 59\nSinclair J.A. said:Custodial\nsentences are generally avoided in the case of young first offenders.A\nCourt's first impression is to ask whether a suspended sentence, with\nprobation, would not be a suitable sentence for the offender, and for the\noffence...This\nwas said in relation to the law as it existed prior to the YOA, but it is still\ngood law with the one qualification that suspended sentences are not available\nto young offenders under the YOA.All the young offenders before this Court pled guilty to a\nseries of charges:(i) [S.B.] - 6;(ii) [C.J.] -9; (iii) [T.D.] - 20; (iv)\n[R.M.] - 6.Does the same leniency normally given to young offenders and first\noffenders apply?Offences committed as part of a spree are not viewed in the\nsame light as offences committed over time with each offence planned and\ndeliberate.It is also true that the Court, subject to the totality principle,\nis entitled to consider the aggravating feature of multiple charges.B.Guilty PleaIn R. v. Layte (1984), 38 C.R. (3d) 204 (Ont. Co. Ct.) at 206\nSalhany Co.Ct. J. succinctly stated why a guilty plea can be an important\nmotivating factor:It is a fundamental\nconcept of our system of justice that a person accused of a crime is entitled\nto demand that the Crown prove his guilt by a fair and impartial trial.There\nis nothing that the court should ever do to whittle down or undercut that\nfundamental principle.At the same time, it would be unrealistic not to\nrecognize that if everyone demanded a full and complete trial our system of\njustice would come to an abrupt halt.It is for that reason that those who are\nguilty, and wish to so plead, should be given special consideration when they\nappear before the court. There are many reasons for this.One is that the\nstate is saved a considerable expense.Another is that witnesses are spared\nthe inconvenience and the expense and occasionally the trauma of a trial.Another is that a plea of guilty is an indication and demonstration of the accused's\nremorse.Other\ncourts have taken issue with the reasons for giving credit for a guilty plea\nand providing circumstances where a guilty plea should not be seen as a\nsignificant mitigating factor (i.e., where evidence of guilt is overwhelming),\nbut all appear to accept that a guilty plea can in the appropriate case\nsignificantly reduce public expense and credit should be given for it (see:Ruby on Sentencing (4th ed.) at 178 to 181; R. v. de Haan, [1967] 3 All E.R.\n618 at 619; R. v. Saulnier (1988), 1987 CanLII 2414 (BC CA), 21 B.C.L.R. (2d) 232 (B.C. C.A.) at 237; R.\nv. T.(R.) (1992), 1992 CanLII 2834 (ON CA), 17 C.R. (4th) 247 (Ont. C.A.) at 262 where it is stated\n\"the appellant is entitled to considerable credit for pleading guilty at\nthe first opportunity\").In this case, it is obvious that the cost to run trials for\neach offence would have been significant and credit must be given for the\nguilty pleas.C.Co-operating with PoliceThis, too, is a factor to be considered.Insofar as an\naccused is prepared to implicate himself further and solve outstanding crimes\nthere is both a saving to the public purse and one more indicium the person is\nprepared to leave crime behind.In R. v. Kirby, Stewart and Cadwell (1981), 61\nC.C.C. (2d) 544 (Ont. Co. Ct.),Graburn Co. Ct. J. reviewed British and\nCanadian authorities which gave significant reductions in sentence to those\naccused of crime who implicated others.In Kirby, the accused, who pled guilty\nto house breaking, had acted as an informant which resulted in the laying of 14\nserious criminal charges.He had a prior record and, but for his co- operation\nwith the authorities, the circumstances of the case were acknowledged by the\nCourt as normally requiring a custodial sentence.He received a suspended\nsentence and probation.(See also:R. v. Laroche (1983), 6 C.C.C. (3d) 268\n(Que. C.A.)at 270.)In Saulnier, mentioned above, Seaton J.A. said\nco-operation with the police and giving evidence for the Crown also may be seen\nas mitigating factors (see p. 237).D.Rehabilitative Steps taken Since SentencingPost-sentence behaviour is a relevant factor to be taken into\naccount when a Court of Appeal reviews the fitness of a sentence.A sentence\notherwise fit may in certain circumstances be reduced if the Court is satisfied\nthe steps taken represent a genuine turning-away from what brought the accused\nto Court in the first place.In R. v. Matthon (unreported, June 30, 1988) this\nCourt had to consider the fitness of a four-year sentence imposed on a first\noffender for armed robbery.In reducing the sentence to three years the Court\ncommented the offender had taken serious strides toward his rehabilitation.Then, in R. v. Ulrich (1990), 1989 CanLII 4729 (SK CA), 75 Sask. R. 26 this Court considered the fitness\nof a 10 month sentence imposed on a first offender for operating a vehicle\nwhile his ability to drive was impaired by alcohol and causing bodily harm.The Court said (at p. 30) it was entitled to take into account events after\nconviction (which indicated the offender was rehabilitated) and reduced the\nsentence to 90 days plus a one-year probation order (see p. 30).It is also relevant in considering whether a sentence, not\nappropriate at the time of sentencing, has become so after sentencing by the\nactions of the offender. Conversely, poor behaviour since an accused has\noffended is relevant on an accused's appeal from sentence, but a sentence fit\nwhen imposed cannot be increased by the offender's subsequent behaviour.This behaviour\nmust be taken into account by the sentencing judge if the accused has\nre-offended.(It also must be recognized there are some crimes for which\nthe rehabilitative aspect of sentencing is diminished, e.g., repeat crimes for\ntrafficking the so- called hard drugs or importing (see:Saulnier, supra at p.\n236; and R. v. Laverty (unreported judgment of B.C.C.A., dated Dec. 18, 1991).In such cases, it is of less significance to consider what the offender has\nbeen doing since sentencing, but this principle is of course not applicable\nhere.)E.Increasing Incidence of Auto TheftWhen [C.J.] was sentenced on May 30, 1994, he was the first\nof this group to be sentenced.No evidence was led as to increasing numbers of\ncar thefts.But when [T.D.] and [R.M.] were sentenced on June 24, 1994 and\nJuly 27, 1994, respectively, Crown counsel spoke of the nature of these crimes\nas group activities, and, in the case of [R.M.], provided statistics:(i)from January 1 to June 30, 1993, there were 55 car thefts involving young\noffenders; and (ii) for the same period in 1994 this figure had climbed to\n133.No similar statistics were provided when [S.B.] was sentenced on August\n31, 1994 but it was the same Youth Court judge, prosecutor and defence counsel\nas for [R.M.]When the case was argued before us, Crown counsel provided\nstatistics prepared by the Regina Police Service which showed between March,\n1993 and September, 1993 there were 65 young offenders charged with auto theft\nand for the same period in 1994 there were 190.He also said with commendable candour\nthe incidence of youth auto theft had fallen off substantially in October.Case law permits a court to take into account the prevalence\nof a particular offence.This issue is closely linked to Crown counsel's\nconcern that these offences were committed largely in groups making it more\nlikely a severe disposition would deter others.As Cory J. said in R. v.\nM.(J.J.):If the activity of the\ngroup is criminal then the disposition imposed on an individual member of the\ngroup should be such that it will deter other members of the group.For\nexample, the sentence imposed on one member of a \"swarming group\"\nshould serve to deter others in the gang.Having said that, I\nwould underline that general deterrence should not, through undue emphasis,\nhave the same importance in fashioning the disposition for a youthful offender\nas it would in the case of an adult.One youthful offender should not be\nobliged to accept the responsibility for all the young offenders of his or her\ngeneration. (See p. 435.)Deterrence\nof others, thus, is to play a role, but we are reminded that the role must not\nbe unduly emphasized.As Arnup J.A. said in R. v. Sears (1978), 2 C.R. (3d)\nS-27 (Ont. C.A.) at p. S-28:...it is appropriate to consider whether in that\nparticular community, at that particular time, there appears to be an unusual\namount of that type of crime, which therefore calls for a sentence which will\nreflect a degree of deterrence to others.At the same time, that situation can\nnever be more than one of the factors which is to be taken into account, the\nparamount question of course always being:what should this offender receive\nfor this offence, committed in the circumstances under which it was committed?This principle can be even more strongly stated with\nrespect to young offenders.R. v. C.(J.M.) (1994), 90 C.C.C.(3d) 385 (Man. C.A.) deals\nwith young offender car theft.Twaddle J.A., speaking for the Court, described\nthe increase in auto theft and vandalism in Winnipeg over the preceding year.\nIn response to the Crown's invitation to impose sentences that would deter\nothers, the Youth Court judge had imposed a disposition of 15 months secure\ncustody for possession of a stolen car and for dangerous driving.Two other\noffences had resulted in dispositions of time served and probation. The young\noffender was 15-years-old and a first offender who had pled guilty.Twaddle\nJ.A. considered to what extent he should be influenced by the prevalence of the\noffence in fashioning a disposition for a young offender. After confirming\nthat, in appropriate cases, for adult offenders, local prevalence of the\noffence might well justify imposition of a greater sentence than the offender\nmight otherwise merit, he concluded it would be inappropriate for this\nprinciple to be given much weight in sentencing young offenders.He referred\nto R. v. M.(J.J.) and then said imposition of a custodial disposition on the\nyoung offender for the possession of auto charge would hold him responsible for\nothers in his generation which would not be appropriate.He set aside the\n15-month secure custody disposition for the possession of auto charge and\nsubstituted a probation order.For the dangerous driving offence, he\nrecommended a sentence from between four and six months open custody.(The\ndangerous driving offence had not been proceeded with by way of indictment and\nwas therefore not before the Court, hence the recommendation.)The incidence of young offender auto theft increased\nsignificantly last summer in Regina, but to say there was a \"gang\" at\nwork appears incorrect.In none of the sentencing hearings or on this appeal\nhas Crown Counsel said there is an organized gang.There is an increase in the\ncrime, but no proof of a gang as those words were used by Cory J. in R. v.\nM.(J.J.) at p. 435.Thus, it is simply the prevalence of the offence which may\nbe given more or less weight depending on the age and the involvement of the\noffender.III.\nApplication of the Sentencing Principles to each YouthA.\n[S.B.]Based on the above, six months secure custody is not a fit\nsentence for [S.B.]The aggravating features previously mentioned with respect\nto this offender are: (i) he escaped custody not once but twice to commit these\noffences;(ii) he has a record of offences which shows a community disposition\nhas not worked with him; and(iii) he does not truly accept his role in these\noffences.Whether he did the acts of destruction to the cars or not, he was\npresent when significant damage, over and above the offence of stealing, took\nplace.In his favour he pled guilty and he was not 1 when these offences were\ncommitted.Taking these factors into account, and mindful of s. 24(1), we set\naside his disposition and impose a disposition of one year secure custody\nconsecutive to the nine month open custody disposition he had been serving\nprior to the commission of these offences.(The secure custody will of course\nbe served first.)In increasing this disposition we note that the YOA provides\na review procedure which will permit this youth to have an impact on the length\nof custody if he chooses to do so.We urge the authorities to work with his\nfamily and make every effort to rehabilitate this youth.B.[C.J.]When [C.J.] received his disposition of 18 months probation\nand 100 hours community service the factors requiring a custodial disposition\nwere the increased number of offences and the even greater damage done to the\nvehicles than that effected by [S.B.] and his friends. He was also somewhat\nolder than [S.B.].However unlike [S.B.]he had no record.His family also\nappeared able to control him.Nonetheless given the multiple nature of these\noffences, the extent of the damage and that some of it was committed while he\nwas awaiting his disposition, it would have been appropriate for the Youth\nCourt Judge to have imposed a short period of custody.Thus, the disposition\nof 18 months probation with community service was not fit when it was imposed.But since [C.J.] received his disposition, his family have\nsignificantly intervened in his life.Section 3(1)(h) of the YOA calls for\nparents to take control of their children.It would be inappropriate to impose\na custodial disposition as a means of deterring others when the parents have\ntaken the responsibility and control that they have in [C.J.]'s case.Thus, in\nthis case, although the disposition was not fit when it was imposed,tt would\nnot be appropriate to interfere with it now.C.[T.D.]The factors dictating a custodial disposition in this case\nwere again the sheer numbers of offences, the damage to property and that some\nof the offences were committed while he was awaiting his disposition.His\nparents appeared to have lost the ability to control him.But to increase his\ndisposition of eight months open custody is not warranted.He was quite young\n(not yet 15 when the majority of the offences were committed) and a first\noffender, and he pled guilty.He also assisted the police with their\ninquiries.The multiple nature of the offences and their prevalence in Regina\nis sufficiently acknowledged by the eight month open custody disposition\nimposed on this young first offender.His involvement with the escape from the\nopen custody facility which occurred subsequent to when he received his\nsentence cannot be used to increase the disposition, but it is of course open\nto the Youth Court to take this into account if he is receives a disposition in\nrelation to that escape.D.[R.M.]This is the youngest of the four youths (approximately 14 and\na half years old when the offences were committed). These were his first\noffences and he was very much a follower in these enterprises with [T.D.] being\nthe leader in at least the second set of the offences.Unlike [T.D.]who\ncommitted 19 offences over 12 or more days, [R.M.] was involved in offences\nduring two nights.He also pled guilty.The reduced number of offences, his\nage and his minimal role in the offences make a disposition of 18 months\nprobation and 100 hours community service work fit when imposed.What he has\ndone since the commission of these offences cannot be used to increase an\notherwise fit disposition.This is clearly an example of a case where there is\nan obvious need to enforce strictly probationary terms and not to wait for\nfurther offences beyond a breachof\nprobation to bring an offender back before the Courts. Again the Youth Court\ncan take his recent behaviour into account if his actions since his disposition\nresult in the prosecution of the additional charges.DATED at the City of Regina, in the Province of Saskatchewan, this 6th day of\nDecember A.D. 1994.I\nconcur_____________________________BAYDA C.J.S.I\nconcur____________________________LANE J.A.____________________________JACKSON J.A."}

C-46; Sex Offender Information Registration Act, S.C.\n2004, c. 10REASONS FOR JUDGMENTStack,\nJ.:INTRODUCTION[1]“Today, I wonder who I would have been, how different my life would be,\nif this hadn’t happened.”So concludes the Victim Impact Statement of a young\nwoman – one of three victims of the crimes that bring us here today for the\nsentencing of R.M.Let us see now what sentence should be imposed for these\ncrimes.[2]Following a trial, the Offender was found guilty of 10 offences against\nthree of his half-siblings: against Mike - one count of sexual assault, two\ncounts of sexual touching, two counts of invitation to sexual touching and two\ncounts of uttering threats; against Todd - one count of sexual assault; and\nagainst Jane - one count of sexual assault and one count of sexual touching.[1]\nJane is now 25 years old; the twins, Mike and Todd, are 19.They grew up in a\nsmall community in the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador.[3]What sentence should the Offender receive after taking into account the\nsentencing principles established in the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c.\nC-46 (the Criminal Code)?[4]Denunciation and deterrence are the primary principles in sentencing for\nsexual assault, especially for the sexual assault of children.I must also\nconsider the aggravating factors that affect sentencing, including that the\nOffender is the victims’ step-brother, the nature and repetition of the\ncriminal acts, the Offender’s lack of insight into his criminal behaviour and\nthe assessment that he is a high risk to reoffend.The Offender’s willingness\nto participate in programs for sex offenders is a mitigating factor.Principles of sentencing[5]The principles for imposing sentence are set out in sections 718 to\n718.2 of the Criminal Code and are well known.For sexual assaults, the\nCourt of Appeal has provided further sentencing guidance in R. v. Atkins\n(1988), 1988 CanLII 201 (NL CA), 69 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 99, 4 W.C.B. (2d) 348 (Nfld. C.A.), by listing\nseveral factors to be considered.I will address them each in turn.The extent of\nthe assaults and other offences[6]The extent and the number of the assaults are aggravating factors, as is\nthe fact that the Offender abused the children serially.That is, as one of\nhis half-siblings became mature enough to rebuff his criminal activity, the\nOffender simply moved on to the next one.Mike[7]The sexual touching of Mike by the Offender began when Mike was seven\nyears old or younger and ended when he was 15 or 16.The Offender touched\nMike’s penis and got Mike to touch his.The Offender had Mike perform oral sex\non him and vice versa.Most invasively, the Offender had anal intercourse with\nMike.[8]Oral sex happened so many times that Mike could not put a number on it.\nThe number of instances of anal intercourse was not clear.Although Mike\ntestified that it occurred more than 10 times, but less than 20, the Court was\nsatisfied that it occurred at least twice.[9]The Offender was also convicted on two counts of uttering threats\nagainst Mike.Mike testified that the Offender threatened to kill him if he\ntold anyone about the abuse.Mike said that the Offender threatened him in\nthis manner more than once and that he felt threatened and intimidated as a\nresult.[10]The other incident of the Offender uttering threats against Mike is\nalleged to have occurred on or about May 10, 2012.The Offender told Todd on\nthe telephone that he would break Mike’s legs and stomp on his face.The\nOffender then turned up in the community where the boys lived looking for Mike.Todd[11]The sexual contact between the Offender and Todd incurred after Todd\nturned 16.Todd began working for the Offender and, as with Mike before him,\nit was deemed more convenient for him to live with the Offender and his mother\nthan to commute from the community where they lived.[12]Todd does not recall the first incident of sexual contact with the\nOffender because there were so many.It began with the Offender using his hand\nto touch Todd’s “privates”.It proceeded to the Offender performing oral sex\non Todd.Eventually, Todd began to reciprocate.Oral sex between the two of\nthem occurred almost every night. Todd feared that he would remain at the\nOffender’s place forever as the Offender’s “slave”.Jane[13]Jane could have been as young as four years old when the sexual abuse by\nthe Offender began.She testified that it continued until she was 12 or 13\nyears old, when she was in Grade seven or Grade eight.These later assaults\noccurred in 2002 or 2003, after the Offender turned 18 but before Jane turned\n14.They are the incidents in respect of which the Offender was found guilty\nby this Court.[14]One night when Jane was in Grade seven or Grade eight, the Offender came\ninto her room.She woke up with his hand down her pants and his finger in her\nvagina.During the same time period, if Jane was alone in the house with the\nOffender he would show her his penis.He would also touch her breasts on the\npretext of giving a hug.Degree of violence\nor force used[15]The Crown and counsel for the Offender agree that any sexual assault is\ninherently violent and compromises the personal integrity of the victim. Each\nof these offences was therefore violent, especially the digital penetration of\nJane’s vagina.None, however, was more violent than the anal intercourse\ninflicted upon Mike.[16]The Offender told Jane that she would get in trouble if she told anyone\nabout the abuse – in particular that her father would hate her.He “pretty\nmuch said that he would kill me”, she testified.[17]Todd testified that he was very much afraid of the Offender who is a\nmuch larger man than he.The Offender would get very angry.He would yell.Although he was seldom physical he would be very “hyper”.His eyes would be\nempty and his pupils would dilate – like he was looking through someone.Todd\nalso testified as to two incidents where the Offender was violent towards him,\nalthough not in connection with a specific sexual assault.[18]The degree of violence is an aggravating factor, although not the most\naggravating.The impact of\nthe crime upon the victims, the family of the victims and the Offender[19]Jane provided a short but pointed Victim Impact Statement that details\nthe negative effects of the years of abuse she suffered at the hands of the\nOffender.These include: guilt; low self-esteem; suicidal ideations; mood\nswings; being mistrustful (especially of men); being anti-social; and eating\nunhealthily.She suffers from flashbacks and nightmares.She has no happy\nchildhood memories to share with her own young child.At trial we learned that\ntwice she has attempted suicide.[20]No Victim Impact Statement was provided by Mike or Todd, despite them\nbeing offered the opportunity.I make no negative inference in this regard and\nam aware that a sexual assault must always be a traumatic experience for the\nvictim.Although a Victim Impact Statement is a helpful tool in the sentencing\nprocess, there are many reasons why a victim would choose not to provide one.The victim’s choice is respected by the court.[21]For the purposes of sentencing, having observed and listened to these\ntwo young men when they testified at trial, I can infer that the abuse that\nthey suffered has had a profoundly negative effect upon their lives.Todd\ndescribed at trial his fear that he would become the Offender’s slave.Mike\nhas, in the words of counsel for the Crown, “had his life ruined”; he abuses\nalcohol and drugs, he has very little education and he is not working.She\ndescribed him as “severely damaged” and from my assessment of him as a witness\nduring the trial I sadly concur.[22]Pursuant to s. 718.2(a)(ii.1) of the Criminal Code, I must take\ninto account that the Offender abused persons under the age of 18.The degree of\ntrust involved[23]The Offender is the victims’ half-brother.Although the victims were\nnot directly under the care of the Offender, to be sexually assaulted by one’s\nolder half-brother is a terrible breach of familial trust.This is especially\ntrue here because at the time of some of the offences Mike and Todd had gone to\nlive and work with the Offender.This is a serious aggravating factor and\nleads to the requirement of a sentence that will sufficiently denounce these\nabhorrent crimes and deter, not just this offender, but others of his ilk.It\nis true that the Offender’s mother also lived in the house and it is she who\ncould be seen as the responsible adult; yet it was the Offender who employed\nthe boys.Inherent in them working for him and living with him is some\nassumption that he would act in their best interests rather than abusing them\nterribly.Public\nabhorrence of the type of crime involved[24]Two of the victims were young children when the assaults began; the\nother was just 16.The public would be rightfully shocked and dismayed by the\nOffender committing such despicable crimes against his innocent and vulnerable half-siblings.His crimes must be denounced in a manner that makes it clear that such\nreprehensible conduct will not be tolerated in our society.The Offender’s\nplea and attitude to what has been done[25]The Offender pleaded not guilty to the charges, as is his right.That this\nmatter went to trial is not an aggravating factor; every accused has the\nconstitutional right to be tried on the charges against him.The Offender’s\nattitude towards the convictions is telling, however.Despite the verdict of\nthe Court, he does not acknowledge his most serious crimes.[26]At the conclusion of the sentencing hearing the Offender apologized to\nhis victims and to his family.One hopes that his apology was sincere.I\nnote, though, that he appears to be more concerned about the fact that he is\nestranged from that side of his family and that he wants to get his life back\non track than about the terrible consequences that his crimes have caused for\nhis victims.This, therefore, is a neutral factor.The biological\nand psychiatric factors that led to the commission of the offences[27]Although no expert evidence was led as to the effect of biological or\npsychiatric factors that may have influenced the Offender’s decision to abuse\nhis half-siblings so despicably, a Pre-sentence Report was provided.A Pre-sentence\nReport, although a useful tool in sentencing, is not subjected to the same\nlevels of proof as is evidence at a trial.It is helpful because of the\nauthor’s assessment of an offender and his likelihood of re-offending.The\nassertions it makes, however, are usually based largely upon what an offender\nand people close to him have told the author.Those assertions have not been\nsubject to cross examination and may be self-serving.Consequently, although\ncarrying some weight, Pre-sentence Reports must be approached with caution.[28]The Offender has been diagnosed with bi-polar disorder.He has a\nhistory of drug use.He attained a Grade 9 education through the assistance of\nspecial education; he is semi-literate.The Offender reports being sexually\nabused on 15 occasions at the age of six by a male neighbour; the matter was\nnot brought to trial and remains on his mind.Counsel for the Offender, while\nnoting these factors, acknowledged that they do not play into the commission of\nthe offences themselves.Rather, they provide background information as to who\nthe Offender is.The need for\nspecific and general deterrence[29]Deterrence, both general and specific, is a key sentencing criterion in\ncases of sexual assault, especially sexual assaults involving children and\nother close familial relations.Because they are unable to protect themselves,\nsociety must protect young people from adults who prey upon their vulnerability.This is done, in part, by making the sentence imposed one that will deter the Offender\nand those of similar predilections from preying on innocent victims.[30]Here the emphasis must be on both specific and general deterrence.The\nPre-sentence Report indicates that the Offender is a high risk to re-offend,\nincluding sexually.I discuss this in more detail in the next section.The prospect of\nsuccessful rehabilitation[31]As stated above, the Pre-sentence Report concludes that the Offender is\nconsidered a high risk to commit further sex-related crimes according to the\nStatic-99 assessment tool.At the sentencing hearing, Susan Melendy-Stark, a\nclassification officer at Her Majesty’s Penitentiary (HMP), testified that the\nOffender was found to be a moderate risk to reoffend based upon the STABLE\nevaluation.She explained that the latter is a more subjective assessment.It\nis used to determine treatment approaches while an offender is in custody.Static-99 is used for post-custody purposes, such as supervision in the\ncommunity and probation.[32]In addition to his assessment under the Static-99 instrument as a high\nrisk to sexually reoffend, the Pre-sentence Report states that the Offender is\nassessed to be a high risk to become involved in further criminal activities\npursuant to the Level of Service/Case Management Inventory.[33]According to Ms. Melendy-Stark, the Offender has been a well-behaved\ninmate while at HMP with no disciplinary issues noted.He has been given the\nopportunity to work almost full-time in the storeroom and has been selected as\na unit inmate representative on the Inmate Committee.[34]I note, however, that the Offender has demonstrated the ability to\nsuccessfully interact with other people while at the same time offending.By\nway of illustration, in 2001 the Offender was found not criminally responsible in\nrespect of a number of violent criminal offenses.At a Newfoundland and\nLabrador Review Board hearing on February 9, 2012, he received a positive\nreport from both his psychiatrist and case manager.[35]Although for a different purpose, the Review Board in its written decision\ndated March 2, 2012 noted positive things about the Offender, including his\n“abstaining from substances, avoiding unhealthy relationships” and “using\npositive strategies to tolerate angry emotions”.Ultimately, the Review Board\nconcluded, “The Board is satisfied that [R.M.] is not now a risk to the safety\nof the public and should therefore be discharge [sic] absolutely”.The years\n2001 to 2012 span the period when the Offender was sexually assaulting his half-siblings.The decision was delivered at the very time that Todd was working and living\nwith the Offender, being sexually abused and living in fear of becoming his\nslave.[36]It seems, therefore, that the Offender may be able to present positively\nto persons in positions of authority while not altering his underlying criminal\nattitudes and behaviours.Although more evidence would be needed to confirm my\nconcerns, for the purposes of sentencing I am not confident that getting along\nwell at HMP necessarily means that there is little risk of the Offender\ncommitting similar or other sexual crimes in the future.[37]The Offender does have the ability to lead a successful life outside of\nprison. This is notwithstanding his mental health challenges and lack of\nliteracy skills. This is evidenced by his ability to start and successfully\nbuild a small vehicle detailing enterprise.The abilities he employed in this\nregard will serve him well once he is released.[38]It is hoped that the Offender will receive treatment that will address\nthe causes of his criminally aberrant behaviour.He has indicated a\nwillingness to do so.His rehabilitation is both in his best interest and in the\nbest interest of society.I conclude, however, that although the risk of\nrecidivism may be ameliorated through appropriate programs in an institutional\nsetting, I am not convinced that rehabilitation should displace deterrence and\ndenunciation as the principle sentencing objectives in these circumstances.The antecedents\nand age of the Offender[39]This factor has been largely addressed above where I outline the\nbiological or psychiatric circumstances of the Offender.The Pre-Sentence\nReport indicates that the Offender is 31 years old, has a Grade 9 education and\nlives with his mother.He has maintained his own vehicle detailing business in\nthe past.He has been diagnosed with Bi-Polar disorder and is under\npsychiatric care.The time spent\nin custody prior to trial[40]Other than for five days when he was arrested, the Offender has not been\nheld in custody as a result of the offenses for which he is being sentenced\ntoday.He is currently serving a two-year youth sentence at HMP.Because five\ndays is so minimal when compared to the custodial sentence that the Offender is\nfacing, I have not taken into account the time that he spent in pre-trial\ncustody relating to these offenses.When I address the issue of totality\nbelow, however, I will take into account the time that the Offender has spent\nin custody arising out of his conviction in Youth Court.Criminal record[41]Although this factor may well be addressed when considering the\nantecedents of the Offender, I prefer to consider it separately.[42]The Offender has been convicted of a number of sex crimes that he\ncommitted while a young offender and that I understand relate to Jane and one\nor more other of her siblings.I have nothing before me to suggest that the\nYouth Court sentence relates to abuses of Mike as well.[2]In 2011 the Offender was convicted of impersonating a police officer.In 2008\nhe was convicted of mischief in relation to property.In addition, from 2000\nto 2003, he was convicted of a number of non-violent crimes as well as for\nuttering threats.These convictions are in addition to the ones for uttering\nthreats, assault and failure to comply with a court order in respect of which he\nwas found not criminally responsible in October of 2001.Sentences\nimposed by other courts in Newfoundland and Labrador and elsewhere in Canada[43]The Crown and the Defence each cited several cases in support of their\nrespective sentencing proposals.Additionally, I have considered other cases,\nidentified below, that were not referred to me by counsel.Crown\ncases[44]R. v. W.W.M. (2006), 2006 CanLII 3262 (ON CA), 206 O.A.C. 342, 205\nC.C.C. (3d) 410 - a sentence of four years for two counts of incest was upheld\nby the Ontario Court of Appeal.The abuse in that case did not last as long as\nin this case.While sexual assault and incest are different offences, there\nare similarities, especially in relation to the sexual assaults upon Mike.[45]R. v. F.(G.) (1996), 1996 CanLII 6611 (NL SCTD), 143 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 181, [1996] N.J.\nNo. 220 (Nfld. S.C. (T.D.)) - a sentence of seven years and six months was\nimposed for sexual offences involving five young children.The sexual activity\nin question involved intercourse, masturbation, oral sex and simulated\nintercourse.There was not a high degree of trust involved and there were\nthreats of violence.[46]R. v. J.J.W., [2002] O.T.C. 594, 55\nW.C.B. (2d) 46 (Sup. Ct.) - a sentence of five years was imposed for\nsexual offences against three children.The sexual activity involved incest\nand gross indecency (the facts of which are not disclosed).As in the present\ncase, the offences started when the accused was a youth.Unlike the present\ncase, there were guilty pleas to some offences.Like here, the accused had had\ntreatment for mental health issues, but had not attempted to deal with sexual\nabuse or offending in counselling.The offender was also ordered to remain\naway from public places where children could reasonably expect to be found.[47]R v. Smith, 2013 NLTD(G) 43 - a sentence of nine years and 347\ndays was ordered for a variety of sexual offences committed against 13 boys\nover a twenty- year period.Like the present case, the offences involved a\nbroad spectrum of sexual activity including anal intercourse.Defence cases[48]R. v. M.C., 2011 NLTD(G) 121 – the offender was sentenced to 10\nmonths for sexually touching a 13 year old girl and having her perform fellatio\non him and to 30 days’ imprisonment to be served concurrently for kissing her,\nfollowed by probation for two years.For having voluntary sexual intercourse\nwith a girl close to the age of consent, the offender was given a consecutive\nsentence of 18 months, again to be followed by two years’ probation.[49]R. v Hammond, 2011 NLTD(G) 8 – the 26 year old offender with no\ncriminal record pleaded guilty to a single instance of voluntary sexual\nintercourse with a 14 year old.The offender was a low risk to reoffend.He\nwas sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment followed by six months’ probation.[50]R. v. Kendell, 2012 NLTD(G) 52 – the 33 year old offender pleaded\nguilty to engaging in a relationship with a 14 year old which included\nintercourse.He was sentenced to 21 months’ imprisonment followed by probation\nfor one year.[51]R. v. Tapper, 2010 NLTD 42 (CanLII) – following a trial, the offender, who\nhad a lengthy criminal record, was found guilty of having voluntary oral sex\nperformed on him by a 13 year old.He was sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment\nto be served consecutively with any sentence he was then serving.Other\ncases[52]Other cases, not cited by either party, are relevant to the discussion\nincluding R. v. Branton, 2013 NLCA 61 (CanLII) where a sentence of 23 months less\na day was imposed for masturbation, oral sex and attempted anal intercourse\nupon a boy.That case also stressed the importance of the principles of denunciation\nand deterrence in cases of the abuse of persons under the age of 18 years.[53]In Q. v. J.C.H., 2009 NLTD 177 (CanLII), the offender was sentenced to\nfive years for sexual abuse of the son of his common-law spouse from when he\nwas five years old until he was eight.The acts included fondling the child’s\npenis and anal intercourse.[54]In R. v. R.A.R., 2000 SCC 8 (CanLII), a custodial sentence of one year was\nimposed upon an employer for one incident of digitally penetrating an\nemployee’s vagina.In R. v. Barrett, 2011 NLCA 5 (CanLII), a one year sentence\nfor a single instance of digital penetration was found to be appropriate.[55]The parties did not address fit sentences for the convictions for\nuttering threats against Mike.In R. v. Freake, 2012 NLCA 10 (CanLII), Welsh and\nRowe JJA addressed the range of sentence for uttering threats and whether such\na sentence should be served consecutively or concurrently.Where the Crown\nproceeds by way of indictment, as in this case, the maximum sentence is five\nyears’ imprisonment.ANALYSISFit sentences[56]The Offender was convicted of 10 offenses, namely Count Nos.: 1 (sexual\ninterference upon Mike);2 (sexual interference upon Mike); 3 (invitation to\nsexual touching in respect of Mike);4 (invitation to sexual touching in\nrespect of Mike); 5 (sexual assault upon Mike); 6 (uttering threats against\nMike); 7 (uttering threats against Mike); 8 (sexual assault upon Todd); 9 (sexual\ninterference upon Jane); and 11 (sexual assault upon Jane).Based upon\napplication of the Kienapple principle, however, the convictions\nrelating to Count Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5 and 9 were conditionally stayed.He is\ntherefore to be sentenced in respect of Count Nos. 1, 6, 7, 8, and 11, taking\ninto account the sentencing principles set out in the Criminal Code, the\naggravating and mitigating factors and the sentences reflected in the case law.[57]The Crown seeks seven years for all of the offenses and did not provide\na breakdown for each offense. Counsel for the Offender suggests a total\nsentence of four years arrived at based upon a range of sentence from five and\na half years to nine years.[58]The most serious offences are those against Mike which were pervasive\nand invasive.That they started when Mike was so young and continued for so\nlong are seriously aggravating factors.Mike’s was a childhood stolen for the\nsexual gratification of his half-brother.Denunciation and deterrence require\na lengthy period of imprisonment, especially because the Offender is\ncategorized as a high risk to reoffend.Defence counsel argues that an appropriate\nsentence would fall in the range of three to five years.I have determined\nthat a fit sentence for Count No. 1, the sexual interference in respect of Mike,\nis five years’ imprisonment.[59]The first conviction for uttering threats was a general threat that the\nOffender would kill Mike if Mike disclosed the abuse.It was part of the\nterror reigned over Mike by the Offender.But there are no facts before the\nCourt that demonstrate that the Offender actually intended to carry through on\nthis threat.The sentence in respect of Count No. 6, therefore, is one month\nof imprisonment to be served concurrently with the sentence for Count No. 1.[60]The first conviction for uttering threats needs to be distinguished from\nthe second which is aggravated in nature.This is because not only did the\nOffender tell Todd that he would harm Mike, but he drove to the community\nlooking for him.Mike could only presume that it was to carry out the threat.Certainly Mike acted as if that were the case by first hiding and then leaving\nthe community.For Count No. 7, I impose a sentence of six months to be served\nconcurrently with the sentence imposed in respect of Count No. 1.[61]As for the offense against Todd, the Offender’s counsel suggests a\nsentence of between two to three years.These were serious infringements on\nTodd’s sexual integrity.Although Todd was not a young child, he was\nvulnerable to his larger and older half-brother.The Offender used his offer\nof employment and a place to live to groom Todd for these assaults.For Count\nNo. 8, a fit sentence is two years’ imprisonment to be served consecutively to\nthe sentence imposed for Count No. 1.[62]For the offense against Jane, the Offender’s counsel suggests a sentence\nof six months to one year.The assault involved digital penetration of her\nvagina.It was therefore invasive and attracts a serious period of incarceration.A fit sentence for Count No. 11 is imprisonment for one year to be served\nconcurrently to the sentence being served by the Offender arising out of his\nconvictions in Youth Court and concurrent to the sentence imposed in respect of\nCount No. 1.[63]Let me explain why the sentence relating to Jane is to be served\nconcurrently.The sentences for the offenses against each of Mike and Todd should\nrun consecutive to one another, and consecutive to the sentence that the\nOffender is serving arising out of his conviction in Youth Court.As far as I\nam aware, these are different victims and their abuse cannot be said to arise\nout of the same “criminal adventure”, to use the unfortunate phrase developed\nin the case law (R. v. Hutchings,\n2012 NLCA 2 (CanLII)).The offense against Jane, however, can be seen as a continuation\nof the Offender’s criminal behavior towards her for which he was sentenced in\nYouth Court and should therefore be served concurrently with that sentence.To\nensure that it is truly served concurrently with what was a two-year sentence\nin Youth Court, it should also be served concurrently to the sentence imposed\nfor Count No. 1.This is not to minimize the severity of the matters before me,\ntheir effect upon Jane, or to suggest that the Offender should not be punished\nfor them.This merely acknowledges the sentencing principle that a sequence of\nevents involving the same victim, while resulting in separate convictions,\nnormally also results in those sentencesbeingserved concurrently (R. v.\nA.T.S., 2004 NLCA 1 (CanLII)).TOTALITY[64]The total of the sentences imposed of five years, one month, six months,\ntwo years and one year equals eight years and seven months.Because I have\ndetermined that certain of the sentences are to be served concurrently, the\nresult is a period of incarceration of seven years.This is what the Crown\nsuggests is a fit total sentence and also it falls within the range of five and\na half to nine years suggested by counsel for the Offender (although well outside\nthe four years to which he suggests the sentence be “rejigged” after the\napplication of the totality principle).As mentioned, neither counsel provided\nsentence recommendations for the convictions on the uttering threats counts.[65]That the Offender is already serving a sentence for another offence is a\nfactor to be considered in applying totality (R. v. S.P.M, 2005 NLCA 36 (CanLII)),\nat para 7).This has already been done by making the sentence for the offense\nagainst Jane concurrent with the other sentences imposed where it would\nnormally attract a consecutive sentence.But it also must be considered in the\noverall context of totality.[66]The total sentence of seven years would, if served consecutively with\nthe Youth Court sentence, amount to a total of nine years of incarceration for\nthe Offender’s sexual abuse of his half-siblings.Is the combined sentence\nunduly long or harsh in that it is not proportionate to the gravity of the\noffence and the degree of responsibility of the Offender?[67]In Hutchings, at para 84, Green CJNL set forth the following list\nof guidelines to be applied to achieve an appropriate and fit total sentence:•When sentencing for multiple offences, the sentencing judge\nshould commence by identifying a proper sentence for each offence, applying\nproper sentencing principles.•The judge should then consider whether any of the individual sentences\nshould be made consecutive or concurrent on the ground that they constitute a\nsingle criminal adventure, without consideration of the totality principle at\nthis stage.•Whenever, following the determinations in the first two steps,\nthe imposition of two or more sentences, to be served consecutively, is\nindicated, the application of the totality principle is potentially engaged.\nThe sentencing judge must therefore turn his or her mind to its application.•The approach is to take one last look at the combined sentence to\ndetermine whether it is unduly long or harsh, in the sense that it is\ndisproportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility\nof the offender.•In determining whether the combined sentence is unduly long or\nharsh and not proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of\nresponsibility of the offender, the sentencing court should, to the extent of\ntheir relevance in the particular circumstances of the case, take into account,\nand balance, the following factors:othe length of the combined sentence in relation to the normal\nlevel of sentence for the most serious of the individual offences involved;othe number and gravity of the offences involved;othe offender’s criminal record;othe impact of the combined sentence on the offender’sprospects for rehabilitation, in the sense that it may be harsh or crushing;osuch other factors as may be appropriate to consider to ensure\nthat the combined sentence is proportionate to the gravity of the offences and\nthe offender’s degree of responsibility.•Where the sentencing judge concludes, in light of the application\nof those factors identified in the previous step that are deemed to be\nrelevant, that the combined sentence is unduly long or harsh and not\nproportionate to the gravity of the offences and the offender’s degree of\nresponsibility, the judge should proceed to determine the extent to which the\ncombined sentence should be reduced to achieve a proper totality.If, on\nthe other hand, the judge concludes that the combined sentence is not unduly\nlong or harsh, the sentence must stand.•Where the sentencing court determines that it is appropriate to\nreduce the combined sentence to achieve a proper totality, it should first\nattempt to adjust one or more of the sentences by making it or them concurrent\nwith other sentences, but if that does not achieve the proper result, the court\nmay in addition, or instead, reduce the length of an individual sentence below\nwhat it would otherwise have been.•In imposing individual sentences adjusted for totality, the judge\nshould be careful to identify:othe sentences that are regarded as appropriate for each\nindividual offence applying proper sentencing principles, without\nconsiderations of totality;othe degree to which sentences have been made concurrent on the\nbasis that they constitute a single criminal adventure; andothe methodology employed to achieve the proper totality that is\nindicated, identifying which individual sentences are, for this purpose, to be\nmade concurrent or to be otherwise reduced.•Finally, the sentencing judge should indicate whether one or more\nof the resulting sentences should be further reduced to reflect any credit for\npre-trial custody and if so, by how much.[68]Here, the total sentence imposed, if served in addition to the current\ntwo-year Youth Court sentence, would be unduly long or harsh in that it would\nbe disproportionate to the gravity of the offences and the Offender’s degree of\nresponsibility.I arrive at this conclusion after considering:1)the sentence when taking into account the number of offenses and number\nof victims - numerous and grave offences against three vulnerable victims;2)the Offender’s record- lengthy, although to the extent that it does\nnot arise out of the sexual abuse of his half-siblings, it is mostly dated and\nnon-violent;3)the impact of the sentence on the Offender’s prospects for\nrehabilitation - although I have emphasized other sentencing factors more than\nrehabilitation, the Offender is a young man and will one day be released; the\nsentence imposed must provide him with a reasonable prospect of a fresh start;\nand4)other factors, including the Offender’s willingness during his\nincarceration to participate in programs designed for sex offenders.[69]These offences were reprehensible and took place over many years; the\nOffender bears a great degree of responsibility.Yet, the combined sentence\nwould be nine years when the sentence for his most serious crimes for which he\nis now being sentenced has been determined to be five years.The Offender is a\nyoung man who will have a long life ahead of him when he is released and so a\nbalance must be achieved.The sentence imposed must not signal that there is\nno hope for him.Nine years in prison is a long time; offenders convicted of\nmanslaughter have been given shorter sentences.[70]After considering the foregoing, a fit and proper sentence is six years to\nbe served consecutively to the sentence being served arising out of his most\nrecent convictions in Youth Court (other than the sentence for the offence\nagainst Jane, which will be served concurrently for the reasons identified\nabove).This will result in a combined sentence of eight years which is still\na substantial sentence and adequately reflects the gravity of the offences and\nthe degree of responsibility of the Offender.Eight years’ incarceration arising\nout of the convictions in the two courts is nevertheless neitherunduly long nor\nharsh; this is because the Youth Court sentence involved sexual abuse by the Offender\nagainst another half-sibling who was not the subject of the matters presently\nbefore me and in respect of which one would normally expect a consecutive\nsentence.[71]The two consecutive sentences that I have imposed are five years and two\nyears, respectively.The latter cannot be made concurrent with the former to\narrive at the six year sentence that I have determined is appropriate.Therefore, to arrive at a just sentence adjusted for totality, I reduce the\nsentence for Count No. 1 to four years’ incarceration.[72]I have previously determined not to grant the Offender any credit for\nhis five days of pre-trial custody.[73]Crown counsel has asked that I make an order pursuant to s. 161(a) of\nthe Criminal Code that for 20 years the Offender remain away from many\npublic places where children could be expected to be found.As horrific as\nthey are, the Offender’s crimes were confined to his family.A ban such as\nthat suggested by the Crown would prevent the Offender from attending at events\nand facilities that he might legitimately attend.In my view, it is more\nimportant that the Offender be precluded from obtaining the opportunity to\nforge relationships with children that could lead to further abuses.Consequently, pursuant to s. 161(1)(b) and (c) and s. 161(2), it is ordered\nthat the Offender, for a period of 10 years from when he is released from\nimprisonment in respect of Count No. 1:1)not seek, obtain or continue any employment, whether or not such\nemployment is remunerated, or becoming a volunteer in a capacity, that involves\nbeing in a position of trust or authority towards persons under the age of 16\nyears; and2)not have any contact, including communicating by any means, with a\nperson who is under the age of 16 years, unless the Offender does so under the\nsupervision of an adult with no criminal record.[74]The Offender is subject to an order in Form 5.03 and must provide\nsamples of bodily substances that are reasonably required for the purpose of\nforensic DNA analysis pursuant to s. 487.051(1) of the Criminal Code.[75]The Offender is subject to a 10 year Firearms Prohibition Order pursuant\nto s. 109(1)(a) of the Criminal Code.[76]The Offender is subject to an order in Form 52 pursuant to s. 490.012(1)\nof the Criminal Code in respect of the Sex Offender Information\nRegistration Act, S.C. 2004, c. 10 for 20 years.DISPOSITION[77]The Offender is sentenced as follows:1)Count No. 1 – four years’ incarceration to be served consecutive to the\nsentence being served arising out of the Offender’s convictions in Youth Court;2)Count No. 6 – one month incarceration to be served concurrent to the\nsentence for Count No. 1;3)Count No. 7 – six months’ incarceration to be served concurrent to the\nsentence for Count No. 1;4)Count No. 8 – two years’ incarceration to be served consecutive to the\nsentence for Count No. 1;5)Count No. 11 – one year incarceration to be served concurrent to the\nsentence being served arising out of the Offender’s convictions in Youth Court\nand concurrent to the sentence for Count No. 1;

The probation order was\nfor twelve months, and included other conditions, including a prohibition from\nuse, possession, or consumption of alcohol, and also a condition to refrain\nfrom contact or communication with Ms. Anstey.On November 17, 2004, I sentenced the\nAccused to a total of sixty days in jail for three breaches of court order ,\ntwo being breaches of probation, and the other being a breach of undertaking.On March 3, 2005, I sentenced the\nAccused to a total of ninety days in jail for two breaches of probation.\nBecause I was told that the Accused was then arranging counseling for substance\nabuse, which counseling was proposed to take place locally, the sentence of\nninety days was allowed to be served on an intermittent basis, with the Accused\ngoing into custody at the Marystown police station on Friday nights, and being\nreleased on Sunday evenings.That was a little more than two weeks\nago. This morning, the Accused pleaded guilty to a charge of breach of\nprobation arising from last Monday night. Briefly, the police were called to go\nto Ms. Anstey’s residence, where they found the Accused. The Accused was\nholding a bottle of beer. When confronted by the police, the Accused ran out\nthe back door of the apartment, and ran away. The subsequent foot chase was\nunsuccessful, but the Accused subsequently was arrested after reporting to the\nlocal police station to serve another weekend on the above mentioned\nintermittent sentence.Here it is to be noted that the\nAccused had served the weekend prior to these events in cells, was released\nSunday evening, and was seen holding the bottle of beer Monday night,\napproximately twenty-five hours following his release from custody, and less\nthan two weeks after being sentenced for an earlier breach of the same\nprobation order.We heard evidence from Ms. Anstey\nthis morning: as far as she is concerned, there is no reason to prohibit the\nAccused from going to her place, and, in fact, the two are in a romantic\nrelationship. This, apparently, notwithstanding his conviction last summer for\nhaving been unlawfully in her dwelling place.The Crown points to a pattern, and\nsays that the only way to break this pattern is to incarcerate the Accused for\nthe new offence, and to convert the intermittent sentence to a period of\nstraight time. The pattern as described by the Crown includes a history of the\nAccused getting drunk at Ms. Anstey’s place, the police being called, the\nAccused going to jail for breach of court order, and then, once released,\nrepeating this type behavior all over again. At least superficially, there\nappears to be some merit to describing this behavior as a pattern.Counsel for the Accused concedes that\nthe intermittent sentence, which was ordered to accommodate the Accused’s plan\nto seek and attend counseling for his substance abuse, has not achieved the\nintended result.However, says Counsel for the\nAccused, other than the drinking and the association with Ms. Anstey, both of\nwhich are prohibited by the probation order, no new or other substantive\noffence was committed by the Accused.When asked whether he had anything to\nsay, the Accused said no.General deterrence appears to have\neluded the Court, as breach of court order continues to be a persistent and\nsignificant part of our docket. My earlier decisions ofR. v. Kelly (2004),\n2004 CanLII 18861 (NL PC), 233 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 108, R. v. Newport, [2004] N.J. No. 37, and R. v.\nJ.R.B., [2004] N.J. No. 39 all refer to the problem seen in the local bailiwick\nin relation to disregard for court orders.In terms of the Accused specifically,\nhe has a lengthy criminal record, including nine prior convictions for breach\nof probation, and five prior convictions for breach of undertaking or\nrecognizance. This offence is his fifteenth conviction for breaching an order\nof the Court.Section 718.1 of the Criminal Code\nstates that any sentence imposed must be \"proportionate to the gravity of\nthe offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.\"Counsel for the Accused correctly\nreminded me of the principle of totality as a factor in tempering the total\nsentence. Because I am going to accede to the request to convert the remaining\npart of the existing intermittent sentence to straight time, pursuant to\nsection 732(2) of the Code, the sentence for the new breach, which will be\nconsecutive to the existing sentence, will be shorter than it might otherwise\nhave been.Accordingly, the Accused is sentenced\nto four months in jail for the offence of breach of probation on March 14,\n2005, which is to be served consecutive to the sentence presently outstanding.\nThe balance of the outstanding sentence is to be served as straight time.The Accused will continue to be bound\nby the probation order: it will be up to the Accused to make application to\nvary any condition in the order once he is released from custody.Finally, the Accused is impecunious,\nand in receipt of social services benefits: it is therefore appropriate to\nwaive the victim fine surcharge.Order accordingly.Dated at Grand Bank, NL, this 21st\nday of March, 2005.Porter, PCJCounselCrown N.SmithAccused M.Evans"}

(2d) 36 D.L.R. (4th) 294ONTARIOHIGH COURT OF JUSTICEEWASCHUK J.10TH JANUARY 1984.Constitutional law -- Charter of Rights -- Cruel and unusual treatment or punishment -- Whether Criminal Code provision providing for sentence of indeterminate detention where accused found to be dangerous offender constitutes cruel and unusual treatment or punishment -- Cr. Code, s. 688 -- Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, s. 12.Constitutional law -- Charter of Rights -- Fundamental justice -- Provisions of Criminal Code respecting dangerous offenders requiring court to consider expert evidence as to accused's future dangerousness -- Whether admission of such evidence violates guarantee to fundamental justice -- Whether dangerous offender provisions of Criminal Code unconstitutional -- Cr.

Code, ss. 688, 689 -- Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, s. 9.The provisions of the Criminal Code which provide that where an accused is found to be a dangerous offender the court may impose a sentence of detention in a penitentiary for an indeterminate period do not violate the guarantees in ss. 7, 9 or 12 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. While it is an aspect of natural justice or procedural due process that evidence to be admissible must have some probative value, the fact that, on the application to have an accused declared a dangerous offender, evidence may be adduced from experts which is at times highly speculative as to future dangerousness does not violate s. 7 of the Charter. The scheme of the legislation is to provide in s. 695.1 of the Criminal Code that the accused's detention is to be reviewed after three years by the National Parole Board and thereafter every two years. The initial three years' detention before parole review is justified on the basis that the accused must be punished for the predicate offence as well as being detained because of the potential for dangerousness. At the three-year point, however, the Parole Board must consider new evidence as well as the evidence of the initial dangerous offender application in its determination whether the offender remains dangerous and should be detained. In that sense, the evidence respecting future dangerousness required to find a person a dangerous offender adduced at the initial application has probative value. Moreover, this review is properly carried out by the National Parole Board which has expertise in the area of parole. The procedures established are demonstrably justifiable procedures generally acceptable in a free and democratic society. It is not necessary that the review be carried out by a judge. Further, the indeterminacy aspect of dangerous offender legislation does not constitute cruel and unusual treatment in violation of s. 12 of the Charter. The imposition of the sentence of indeterminate detention according to the procedures set out in the Criminal Code is acceptable to a large segment of the Canadian population, and can be applied on a national basis in accordance with ascertained or ascertainable standards. The provisions have a social purpose, namely, the protection of society from dangerous offenders. The imposition of the sentence of indeterminate detention also accords with public standards of decency and propriety. In considering whether legislation accords with public standards of decency and propriety, the court should consider the average or normal dangerous offender application rather than the worst case against the Crown. Should such a case come before the court then the preferable practice would not be to invalidate otherwise valid legislation but rather to hold it inoperative in the particular case. Finally, such legislation is not degrading in the sense that it is cruel and unusual. The punishment is not grossly disproportionate to the crime and the offender's potential to harm others. It was highly persuasive that the Supreme Court of Canada has previously found that the predecessor legislation was not cruel and unusual punishment within the meaning of the Canadian Bill of Rights. Finally, the dangerous offender provisions do not violate the guarantee against arbitrary detention or imprisonment in s. 9 of the Charter. In particular, the fact that the provisions give the court a residual discretion not to impose the sentence of indeterminate detention notwithstanding all the statutory criteria have been met does not lead to a violation of s. 9. The availability of this discretion does not give a court licence to be unprincipled and capricious. Rather, it recognizes that all dangerous offenders are not alike and where there is a probability of cure preventive detention may not be required.APPLICATION for a declaration that Part XXI of the Criminal Code relating to dangerous offenders is unconstitutional.\nRe Mitchell and The Queen (1983), 1983 CanLII 1856 (ON SC), 42 O.R.

Evernden, for Attorney-General of Canada.EWASCHUK J.:-- The applicant, Miss Moore, having been dulyconvicted of a serious personal injury offence for which shemay be sentenced to imprisonment for 10 years or more andhaving been given proper notice that the Crown intends to applyto a court that she be found to be a dangerous offender, hereinapplies that Part XXI of the Criminal Code entitled \"DangerousOffenders\" be declared ultra vires as infringing variousprovisions of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.This motion has been argued on the basis that the court isnot entitled to consider the factual background to thisapplication. The following issues have been raised on behalf ofthe applicant as to why the dangerous offenders provisions ofthe Criminal Code infringe the Charter.(a) Indeterminacy of preventive detentionWhere a court concludes that the Crown has established beyonda reasonable doubt all the statutory requirements that theoffender is a dangerous offender, the court may, pursuant to s.688 of the Criminal Code, sentence the offender to anindeterminate period in a penitentiary. In effect, suchsentence is equivalent to a life sentence imposed, e.g., forbreak and entry of a dwelling-house pursuant to s. 306. Sincethe offender must, by definition, be convicted of a \"seriouspersonal injury offence\", the sentence is partly punitive butis mainly imposed for the protection of the public. In otherwords, the imprisoned offender is rendered incapacitated fromcommitting future crimes: see R. v. Higginbotham, [1961] 3 AllE.R. 616 at p. 619 (C.A.), re the purpose of preventivedetention.The applicant contends that detention is justified only by afinding of dangerousness. In the present case, it is allegedthat Miss Moore is a dangerous \"violent\" offender as opposed toa dangerous \"sexual\" offender. By reason of the statutorycriteria, the offender must at this time be considereddangerous. The applicant, however, contends that \"continuingdetention can only be justified by continuing dangerousness\"which cannot be validly predicted at the time of the initialfinding that the person is a dangerous offender.In my opinion this submission fails to consider the effect ofs. 695.1 of the Criminal Code. Admittedly the present opinionthat the offender is dangerous has limited future value but s.695.1 requires that the National Parole Board review theoffender's case three years from the day on which that personwas taken into custody and not later than every two yearsthereafter. This review requirement is obviously much earlierthan the 25-year requirement for someone convicted of firstdegree murder. On review of the history and presentcircumstances and condition of the dangerous offender, theParole Board pursuant to s. 10(1) of the Parole Act, R.S.C.1970, c. P-2, may then grant parole where it considers that (1)the inmate has derived the maximum benefit from imprisonment,(2) the reform and rehabilitation of the inmate will beaided by the grant of parole, and (3) the release of the inmateon parole would not constitute an undue risk to society.Where the dangerous offender has spent adequate time tosatisfy the predicate or underlying offence which triggered theapplication, it is obvious the predominate factor to beconsidered in releasing a dangerous offender on parole is thatperson's dangerousness, i.e., whether that person's release\"would not constitute an undue risk to society\". Thatdetermination cannot be made at this time but must be made on acase-by-case basis when the person is eligible for release andis, in fact, reviewed. If at that time the Board errsjurisdictionally, prerogative remedy will be the appropriaterecourse: see Re Mitchell and The Queen (1983), 1983 CanLII 1856 (ON SC), 42 O.R. (2d)481, 6 C.C.C. (3d) 193, 150 D.L.R. (3d) 449 (Ont. H.C.J.).I do not consider that such review must be conducted by ajudge. Instead it seems to me that the National Parole Boardhas a specialized expertise in the area of parole and althoughtheir procedure and method of review are not perfect, neitherare curial reviews. Moreover, the Charter does not demandperfection but only demonstrably justifiable proceduresgenerally acceptable in a free and democratic society. Reviewof prison inmates, including offenders held on preventivedetention, by a parole service is such an acceptable practice:see Rummel v. Estelle, Director, Texas Department ofCorrections (1980), 445 U.S. 263 (S.C.).(b) Discretion in imposition of sentenceSection 688 of the Criminal Code provides that after findingthat a person is a dangerous offender the court \"may thereuponimpose a sentence of detention in a penitentiary for anindeterminate period\" (emphasis mine). Thus, s. 688 providesthe court with a discretion not to impose preventive detentioneven where all requirements have been satisfied.The above discretion has been considered in R. v. Carleton(1981), 1981 ABCA 220 (CanLII), 69 C.C.C. (2d) 1, 23 C.R. (3d) 129, [1981] 6 W.W.R.148 (Alta. C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. granted April 5,1982, C.C.C. loc. cit., 36 A.R. 270n, 42 N.R. 269n. In thatpre-Charter case, it seems that the majority of the court heldthat s. 688 validly gives a court hearing a dangerous offenderapplication a residual discretion not to impose anindeterminate sentence where there exists a probability of theoffender's cure in the not-too-distant future. In my view, thatinterpretation is a valid gloss on and provides an appropriatejudicial criterion to s. 688.What is more, the applicant cannot validly complain of adiscretion that may enure to her benefit even though the courtmay be otherwise satisfied that she is a dangerous offender.(c) Violation of fundamental justiceThe applicant contends that s. 688(a) infringes s. 7 of theCharter on the basis that evidence as to future threat tosociety or dangerousness is so inherently speculative that itviolates the aspect of fundamental justice that evidence to beadmissible must have some probative (i.e., relevant or logical)value. It is undoubted that this constitutes a part of thebundle of procedural rights commonly known as \"natural justice\"or procedural fairness (also known as procedural due process):see R. v. Deputy Industrial Injuries Com'r, Ex p. Moore, [1965]1 Q.B. 456 at pp. 488-9.I accept the submission that the evidence of a psychiatrist,psychologist or criminologist is at times highly speculativeand in certain instances a lay person is in as good a positionto make a prediction as to future dangerousness. In the finalsay, the court, however, must be so satisfied and not theexpert witnesses. That is not to say that experts may notassist the court, especially as to whether the offendercurrently suffers from a psychological disorder, e.g.,psychopathy, which may be relevant to the likelihood of futuredangerous conduct.While conceding that the expert evidence may have someimmediate probative value, the applicant maintained that it haslimited future value and that past conduct may be a betterforecaster than expert evidence. Assuming that the aboveconcession is correct, it seems to me that s. 695.1 meets theapplicant's complaint. The initial three years' detentionbefore parole review is justified on the basis that theapplicant must be punished for the predicate offence as well asdetained because of the potential for dangerousness. At thethree-year point, however, the Parole Board must consider newevidence, e.g., fresh psychiatric assessments, as well as theevidence at the initial dangerous offender application, in itsdetermination whether the offender remains dangerous, i.e.,whether the inmate's release would not constitute an undue riskto society.In the above sense, I find that the evidence respectingfuture dangerousness required to find a person a dangerousoffender has probative value. Of course, the predictiveaccuracy of the requisite evidence does diminish in probativevalue with time. As time progresses, new evidence will probablybe required on a case-by-case basis by the Parole Board tojustify further detention of the offender.(d) Cruel and unusual punishmentThe applicant maintains that the indeterminacy aspect of adangerous offender finding constitutes cruel and unusualpunishment and thereby violates s. 12 of the Charter.I accept the applicant's submission that the phrase \"crueland unusual treatment or punishment\" should be interpreted as\"interacting expressions colouring each other ... to beconsidered together as a compendious expression of a norm''which must be given meaning in the context of contemporaryCanadian society: see Miller and Cockriell v. The Queen, 1976 CanLII 12 (SCC), [1977]2 S.C.R. 680 at p. 690, 31 C.C.C. (2d) 177 at p. 184, 70 D.L.R.(3d) 324 at p. 332 (S.C.C.), per Laskin C.J.C.In an attempt to analyse the above compendious norm, theapplicant offered the following criteria adopted from anarticle by W. S. Tarnopolsky (as he then was), \"Just Deserts orCruel and Unusual Treatment or Punishment? Where do we Look forGuidance?\" (1978), 10 Ottawa Law Rev. 1. First, is itacceptable to a large segment of the population? In response, Iam of the opinion that a large segment of the Canadian public,fully informed of the dangerous offenders provisions, wouldfavour this process. This is so, especially given the strictevidential requirements which must be satisfied before a personcan be found a dangerous offender.Secondly, can it be applied on a national basis in accordancewith ascertained or ascertainable standards? The specificity ofthe statutory requirements itself answers the above test.Thirdly, does it have some social purpose? The obvious answeris: the protection of society from dangerous offenders.Fourthly, does it accord with public standards of decency andpropriety or does it shock the general conscience so as to beintolerable in fundamental fairness? In response, it isdifficult to comprehend how the dangerous offender provisionsof the Criminal Code would shock the general conscience so asto be intolerable in fundamental fairness given all therequirements and safeguards written into the process. Not onlyis the dangerous offender eligible for parole long before alife offender, but he or she has greater rights of appeal.In deciding that the carefully crafted dangerous offenderprovisions accord with public standards of decency andpropriety, I gauge those provisions not on the \"worst casescenario\" to the Crown, but on what I consider to be an\"average\" or \"normal\" dangerous offender, and where all thestatutory conditions have been met. In assessing Charterapplications, it is generally socially unrealistic to consideronly the possible worst case where such case is not before thecourt. Indeed, it is only too easy for the creative legalimagination to concoct bizarre examples that never come tocourt. Where the worst case comes before the court, then thepreferable practice is not to invalidate otherwise validlegislation but to hold it inoperative in the particular case:see Re Mitchell and The Queen, supra, R. v. Noble (1983), 1983 CanLII 1727 (ON SC), 42O.R. (2d) 285, 6 C.C.C. (3d) 17, 150 D.L.R. (3d) 103, and byanalogy, R. v. Shelley, 1981 CanLII 201 (SCC), [1981] 2 S.C.R. 196, 59 C.C.C. (2d)292, 123 D.L.R. (3d) 748 (S.C.C.), a Bill of Rights judgment.This also is the general American approach in dealing withconstitutional challenges.Finally, the fifth test is whether the detention is degradingto human dignity. Obviously, all imprisonment is degrading tosome degree to human dignity. But it must also be cruel andunusual. Where an offender has been convicted of a seriouspersonal injury offence and otherwise comes within thestatutory conditions, it cannot be said that this form ofpreventive detention with possibility for parole constitutescruel and unusual punishment. In other words, the punishment isnot grossly disproportionate to the crime and the offender'spotential to harm others.In arriving at the above conclusion, I find support in thefollowing cases which have held that the present dangerousoffender provisions do not constitute cruel and unusualpunishment: see R. v. Simon (No. 3) (1982), 1982 CanLII 2979 (NWT SC), 69 C.C.C. (2d) 557,141 D.L.R. (3d) 380, [1982] 5 W.W.R. 728 (N.W.T.S.C.), and R.v. Morrison (July 7, 1983, Ont. Co. Ct., as yet unreported[summarized 10 W.C.B. 171]). I am also mindful that theUnited States Supreme Court in Rummel v. Estelle, supra, hasheld that a mandatory life sentence pursuant to a recidiviststatute (analogous to our former habitual criminal provisions)did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment where parolewas provided.In considering the compendious meaning of \"cruel and unusual\"I consider that no reference need be made to s. 1 of theCharter. Where the particular Charter provision contains itsown modifier, e.g., unreasonable, arbitrary or cruel andunusual, the provision is self-defined as to what constitutes areasonable limitation. For that reason, the onus is on theapplicant to establish the infringement, although the Crown mayin the particular case tactically have to justify thelimitation.Furthermore, in holding that the dangerous offenderprovisions do not constitute cruel and unusual treatment orpunishment, I am mindful that the Supreme Court of Canada in Exparte Matticks (1973), 15 C.C.C. (2d) 213n, [1973] S.C.R. visub nom. Pearson v. Lecorre, has held that the preventivedetention provisions for habitual criminals, far more Draconicthan the dangerous offenders provisions, did not violate theCanadian Bill of Rights, R.S.C. 1970, App. III. In consideringthe relevance of Matticks, supra, to the present application, Iprefer the approach of Esson J.A. in R. v. Whyte (December 20,1983 (B.C.C.A.), as yet unreported [summarized 11 W.C.B. 214]),that Supreme Court of Canada rulings on Bill of Rightsprovisions be considered persuasive if not binding on lowercourts interpreting similar provisions in the Charter. This isto be contrasted with the approach of Wetmore Co. Ct. J. in R.v. Smith (September 9, 1983 (B.C.Co.Ct.), as yet unreported[since reported 35 C.R. (3d) 256]), where he decided thatthe Charter, being a constitutional document, permits a freshlook at all Charter provisions, even those with Bill of Rightsanalogues which have been previously interpreted by the SupremeCourt of Canada.(e) Arbitrary detention of imprisonmentThe applicant submits that a dangerous offender findingconstitutes arbitrary detention or imprisonment within themeaning of s. 9 of the Charter since the relevant provisionslack appropriate legislative criteria or standards.In effect, this argument is simply a restatement of theearlier attack against the discretion afforded a court not tofind a person a dangerous offender even where all the statutoryconditions have been fulfilled. I adopt my earlier reasoningand reiterate that the legislative criteria for finding aperson a dangerous offender is perhaps the most detailed anddemanding in the Criminal Code. Furthermore, the residualdiscretion not to make the finding adds to rather thanderogates from that statutory criterion. Moreover, theavailability of this discretion does not give a court licenceto be unprincipled and capricious. Instead it recognizes thatnot all dangerous offenders are alike (see R. v. Gustavson(1982), 1982 CanLII 529 (BC SC), 1 C.C.C. (3d) 470 (B.C.S.C.)), and where there is aprobability of cure, preventive detention may not be required(see R. v. Carleton, supra). Therefore, I do not find thatthe dangerous offender provisions constitute arbitrarydetention or imprisonment.ConclusionFor the above reasons, Part XXI of the Criminal Code,\"Dangerous Offenders\" does not violate the Canadian Charterof Rights and Freedoms. Accordingly, the application isdismissed.Application dismissed."}

AND SECTION 110(1) OF THE Y.C.J.A.R E A S O N SF O RS E N T E N C EDEVLIN,\nJ (ORALLY):This is the decision on sentence on the\nmatter of D.P..On February 19th, 2008, D.P. pled guilty to three\ncounts: one count of theft under $5,000.00, one count of possession of child\npornography, one count of accessing child pornography.D.P. is before the\nCourt today to be sentenced under the Youth Criminal Justice Act.The\ncrown is proposing a 60 day secure custody sentence, followed by probation.The defense is proposing a non-custodial probationary sentence.The issue is\nwhat sentence is most appropriate.The facts regarding the theft charge are as\nfollows.On May 7th, 2007, I think it was 2007, and I’m sorry,\ncounsel?MR.\nGREENWAY:2007.THE COURT:Thank you.MR. GREENWAY:Thank you.THE COURT:D. selected two items from the\nZellers store at the Oshawa Centre and concealed them.He then tried to leave\nwithout paying and was caught.The facts regarding the pornography charge\nare as follows.Between January 1st, 2006 and February 27th,\n2007 both D.’s school and his mother noticed a significant change in his behaviour.D. became aggressive and assaultive.He repeatedly showed up at school\nstoned.On one occasion he brought marijuana to school.On another occasion\nhe brought a cartoon to school which was entitled, “How the Vice Principal\ndied.”During this time D.’s mother called the police because D. was caught\naccessing child pornography sites on the family computer.This computer was\nforensically examined by the police who found 184 images of child pornography.One image of child pornography was also found on D.’s sister’s computer.I turn now to the legal analysis.The\npurpose of sentencing under the Youth Criminal Justice Act is to hold a\nyoung person accountable through the imposition of just sanctions that have\nmeaningful consequences.In determining the appropriate sentence the Court is\nrequired to consider all sanctions, other then custody, that are reasonable in\nthe circumstances and ensure that the sentence is the least restrictive one\ncapable of achieving the purposes of sentencing, under the Youth Criminal\nJustice Act, is the one that is most likely to rehabilitate the young\nperson and integrate him into society, and is one that promotes a sense of\nresponsibility in the young person and an acknowledgment of the harm done to\nthe victim and the community.In addition, the Court is required to take into\naccount the degree of participation of the young person in the commission of\nthe offence, the harm done to the victim and whether it was intentional or\nreasonably foreseeable, any reparation made by the young person to the victim\nor the community, the previous findings of guilt of the young person and any\nother relevant, aggravating and mitigating circumstances related to the young\nperson or the offence.I will now address the factors relating to\nthe offence in this case and the offender, as well as the aggravating and\nmitigating circumstances.D.P. has pled guilty to a theft under charge\nand to possessing and accessing child pornography.The theft under charge is\nminor, particularly in comparison to D.’s other charges.As stated by the\nOntario Court of Appeal in R. v. EO, (2003), 2003 CanLII 2017 (ON CA), O.J. No. 563, “Possession\nof Child Pornography is a crime of enormous gravity both for the affected\nvictims and for society as a whole.”In the case before me, the pornography\ninvolved 184 images of young children in sexual poses and/or engaging in sexual\nactivity.A sample of 15 images was provided to the Court for review.Overall\nthe sample images were graphic and disturbing.All of the children in the sample\nwere female.Most were very young, approximately four to eight years old.One\nor two of the images appeared to be of very young girls, approximately two or\nthree years old.One image was of an older girl, approximately 12 or 13 with a\nshaved pubic area.Almost all of the images were faceless with only the\nchild’s torso, genital area and upper leg area showing.One image showed a\nyoung girl lying down on a bed on her back.She was naked.On her body,\nwritten in red paint or lipstick, were the words “Hurt me” and “Slut”.One\nimage showed two girls engaging in cunnilingus.Some images showed penile\npenetration of the girls.Other images showed an adult penis placed at the\nopening of the child’s vagina.In the few photos that showed a child’s face, the\nchildren appear to be upset, scared, unhappy and uncomfortable.The child\nwhose body had red writing on it looked scared and frozen as if she was devoid\nof all emotion.D.P. is a first time offender.He was 16 at\nthe time he committed the offences, and is now 17 years old.He is currently\ndoing well at the Durham Alternative Secondary School\nwhere he has attended since March/April 2007.Until recently he was also\nmaintaining full time employment at Oshawa This Week.According to the\npre-sentence report he is at times polite and very helpful and at other times\nangry and aggressive.His mother describes him as a dedicated and loyal worker\nwho enjoys helping others.According to the section 34 assessment, D.\nsuffers from chronic and severe emotional and inter-personal difficulties.The aggravating circumstances are as\nfollows.The pornography charges involve 184 images of child pornography.D.\nhas been assessed as a moderate risk to re-offend.D. has long-standing and\nunresolved emotional and inter-personal issues.The mitigating circumstances are as follows.D.P. has pled guilty.He is a first time offender.He is in school and has\nbeen working full time.The first issue is whether a custodial\nsentence is available under the Youth Criminal Justice Act.The crown\nsubmits that custody is an option pursuant to section 39(1)(d) of the Act.I\nnote that this is the only section that could possibly apply to this case.The defense submits that custody is not an\noption.I agree with the defense.Section 39(1)(d) states, “A Youth Justice Court shall not commit a young person to custody\nunless in exceptional cases where the young person has committed an indictable\noffence, and the aggravating circumstances of the offence are such that the imposition\nof a non-custodial sentence would be inconsistent with the purpose and\nprinciples set out in section 38.”This section was reviewed by the Supreme\nCourt of Canada in R. v. W, (2006), 2006 CanLII 1761 (ON CA), 205 C.C.C. (3d) 183.The Court held\nthat section 39(1)(d) can only be invoked because of the circumstances of the\noffence, not the circumstances of the offender or the offender’s history.The\nCourt also stated that exceptional cases are limited to the clearest of cases\nwhere a custodial disposition is obviously the only disposition that can be\njustified.In the case before me there are no\ncircumstances of the offence that render it exceptional, nor was the crown able\nto articulate any basis for concluding that a custodial sentence is the only\njustifiable disposition.I therefore conclude that custody is not an available\noption in this case.I note that even if a custodial disposition were an\navailable option I would not impose it in this case because such a sentence\nwould be inconsistent with the recommendations of the section 34 assessment.The next issue is what sentence is\nappropriate.I have considered the facts of this case in the context of the\nsentencing principles set out in the Youth Criminal Justice Act.I conclude that the appropriate sentence is two\nyears probation based on the following reasons.This is the maximum\nprobationary sentence allowed under the Youth Criminal Justice Act.Such a sentence will provide D. with strict community supervision.The maximum\nprobationary sentence will also ensure that D. receives the intensive therapy\nand counseling recommended by both the pre-sentence report and the section 34\nassessment.DNA order declined."}

Les ordonnances deprobation et les ordonnances accessoires demeurent inchangées.The\njudgment of the Court was delivered byQUIGG, J.A.I.Introduction[1]The Attorney General seeks leave to appeal\nconcurrent conditional sentences imposed by a Provincial Court judge after\nBernard Joseph Martin pled guilty to two separate indictable charges, one of\npossession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking (s. 5(2) of the Controlled\nDrugs and Substances Act, S.C. 1996, c. 19) and the other for possession of\na prohibited weapon (s. 91 of the Criminal Code).Mr. Martin pled not\nguilty to two additional indictable charges of possession for the purposes of\ntrafficking (cannabis and cannabis resin), but, pursuant to s. 606(4) of the Criminal\nCode,pled guilty to the lesser included offences of possession of a\ncontrolled substance (s. 4(1) of the Controlled Drugs and\nSubstances Act), which pleas were accepted. The sentencing judge imposed a\nconditional sentence of 22 months for the offence under s. 5(2) of\nthe Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, concurrent terms of 12\nmonths for those under s. 4(1) of the Act, and a concurrent term of\n6 months for the offence under the Criminal Code.[2]For the reasons that follow, I would grant leave\nto appeal, allow the appeal, and vary the custodial portion of the sentences to\na term of 15 months imprisonment for the s. 5(2) offence, and, because it will\nhave no affect on the total, one month concurrent for the s. 4(1) offences and\nthe Criminal Code offence.The probation orders and the various\nancillary orders made in the Provincial Court remain unaffected.As stated in R.\nv. R.T.S., 2006 NBCA 65 (CanLII), 301 N.B.R. (2d) 338, at paras. 30 and 31, the\ncustodial portion of the sentences takes effect from the date of the original\nsentence and the time served under the original conditional custodial sentence\nmust be deducted from the balance of the sentence to be served in prison.II.Background[3]On March 11, 2010, members of the Fredericton\nPolice Force Drug Crimes Unit set up surveillance in close proximity to Mr.\nMartin’s residence. As a result of an ongoing investigation, the Unit\ndetermined it had grounds to arrest Mr. Martin for various drug offences. At\n1:05 a.m., a Detective advised other officers that Mr. Martin was in his\ntruck on Main Street in Fredericton. Mr. Martin was subsequently stopped and\nwas asked for his driver’s license, registration and insurance, all of which\nwere provided. He was arrested, and a search of his truck revealed the\nfollowing items were in his possession:➢various\nsmall Ziploc bags of hash (cannabis resin) totalling 4.12 grams (approximate\nstreet value of $61.80);➢7.01\ngrams of marihuana (approximate street value of $91.70);➢13\nindividual Ziploc baggies of cocaine totalling 5.75 grams,(approximate street value of $575);➢a\ncell phone;➢a\npair of silver coloured brass knuckles; and➢$585\nin Canadian bills.[4]Mr. Martin acknowledged the drugs were his and\nstated he had been “rounding them up” to give out to people who would be\nattending his brother’s birthday party the following week. He admitted he used\nmarihuana, and that he had sold marihuana in the past, and explained that a\nfriend made the brass knuckles for him. Mr. Martin was eventually charged\nand, as indicated above, pled guilty.A pre-sentence report was ordered.III.Sentencing[5]A sentencing hearing was held on November 21,\n2011, at which counsel for Mr. Martin sought a conditional sentence while Crown\ncounsel requested a sentence of 12-18 months imprisonment to be followed by\nprobation.Crown counsel also sought various ancillary orders. The sentencing\njudge considered the pre-sentence report to be favourable and particularly\nnoted that Mr. Martin was paying child support for three children and that he\nhad worked hard to reduce various debts, including payment of approximately\n$13,000 of $15,000 in child support arrears. On the other hand, the judge found\na previous conviction in 2003 to be an aggravating factor.[6]The judge imposed the following sentences:a)With respect to Count #1, 22 months imprisonment\nto be served concurrently to any other sentence and in the community pursuant\nto section 742.1 of the Criminal Code of Canada, a probation order for a\nperiod of 12 months and a victim fine surcharge of $100;b)With respect to Count #2, 12 months imprisonment\nto be served concurrently to any other sentence and in the community pursuant\nto section 742.1 of the Criminal Code of Canada, a probation\norder for a period of 12 months and a victim fine surcharge of $100;c)With respect to Count #3, 12 months imprisonment\nto be served concurrently to any other sentence and in the community pursuant\nto section 742.1 of the Criminal Code of Canada, a probation\norder for a period of 12 months and a victim fine surcharge of $100;d)With respect to Count #4, 6 months imprisonment\nto be served concurrently to any other sentence and in the community pursuant\nto section 742.1 of the Criminal Code of Canada, a probation order for a\nperiod of 12 months, a prohibition from possessing firearms for a period of 10\nyears pursuant to section 110 of the Criminal Code of Canada, a\nweapons forfeiture order pursuant to section 485 of the Criminal Code of\nCanada and a victim fine surcharge of $50.[App. Sub., pp. 4-5]IV.Issues raised on appeal[7]The Attorney General seeks leave to appeal on\nthe grounds that the sentencing judge erred in law and in principle by:(1)Imposing a sentence that is manifestly\ninadequate and unreasonable having regard to all of the circumstances.(2)Failing to adequately consider the principles of\nsentencing as delineated in the Criminal Code.V.Standard of Review[8]In R. v. R.K.J. (1998),\n1998 CanLII 12252 (NB CA), 207 N.B.R. (2d) 24, [1998] N.B.J. No. 483\n(C.A.) (QL), Drapeau J.A. (as he then was) sets out the analytical framework\nthat should be applied to the determination of applications for leave to appeal\nsentence:It is the undoubted duty of this Court to review the\nfitness of any sentence imposed. That it must do so bearing in mind the\nprivileged position occupied by the trial judge is settled law. All agree that\nthe sentencing process is hardly an exact science. It is a subjective process\nwhich features a large measure of discretion. The intrinsically discretionary\nnature of the sentence decision explains, at least in part, the Supreme Court's\ninsistence on a deferential approach to all sentence reviews. See R. v.\nShropshire, 1995 CanLII 47 (SCC), [1995] 4 S.C.R. 227, R. v. M.(C.A.), 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R.\n500, and R. v. MacDonnell, 1997 CanLII 369 (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 305.Nevertheless, deference has its\nlimits, and this Court is duty bound to vary a sentence in appropriate\ncircumstances. Indeed, if the sentencing court commits an error of law or an\nerror in principle, or if the sentence imposed is clearly unreasonable, there\nis no longer room for deference and this court is required to impose the\nsentence which it considers fit. See R. v. F.S.A. (1996), 1996 CanLII 10270 (NB CA), 182 N.B.R.\n(2d) 20; 463 A.P.R. 20 (C.A.), and R. v. Melanson (E.R.) (1998), 1998 CanLII 12185 (NB CA), 199 N.B.R. (2d) 338;\n510 A.P.R. 338 (C.A.).In this context, an error in law most\ncommonly occurs as a result of a misapprehension of the evidence or a\nmisapplication of judicial precedents. As for an error in principle, it\ntypically involves one or more of\nthe following: the application of wrong sentencing principles, a failure to\nconsider relevant factors or the taking into account of irrelevant\nconsiderations. As well, there will be cases where the failure to give proper\nweight to each relevant circumstance will amount to an error in principle. (Our\ncourt will necessarily be slow to find an error of this nature for, if it was\notherwise, professions of deference would soon ring hollow.) Finally, a\nsentence will be clearly unreasonable where it is either inordinately long or\ninordinately short. It will reach this level only if it is a substantial and\nmarked departure from the sentence customarily imposed for similarly situated\noffenders committing similar crimes. [paras. 11-13]This standard of\nreview has since been applied in numerous cases, the\nmost recent being R. v. Frost, 2012 NBCA 94 (CanLII), which is being released\nconcurrently with this decision.VI.Analysis[9]The appropriateness\nof a conditional sentence for a drug trafficking offence is dealt with in Frost.\nIn brief, the principles of denunciation and general deterrence must take\nprecedence in cases of trafficking or possession for the purpose of\ntrafficking, and, absent exceptional circumstances, this Court has consistently\nemphasized these principles, in such cases, by imposing jail sentences.[10]In my view, this\ncase does not reveal any “exceptional circumstances”.An accused’s child\nsupport obligation has been determined not to be an exceptional\ncircumstance (see R. v. Bowlin, 2010 NBQB 59 (CanLII), 354 N.B.R. (2d) 144, aff’d\n2010 NBCA 90 (CanLII), 366 N.B.R. (2d) 292, leave to appeal refused [2011] S.C.C.A. No.\n95 (QL)).To the extent the sentencing judge considered this to be a mitigating\nfactor, he erred.[11]For the reasons\ngiven in Frost, the conditional sentences imposed in this case are\nunreasonable in that they do not take into account the governing sentencing\nprinciples for cases of possession for the purposes of trafficking.In\naddition, this case reveals a need for specific deterrence considering that Mr.\nMartin has a previous conviction for an offence of possession for the purpose\nof trafficking and has previously served time in jail.[12]Considering the\nabove, and considering the nature of the drug involved in the charge under s.\n5(2), I am of the view that a fit sentence for that offence would have been 15\nmonths in jail. I would therefore vary the sentence imposed for that offence to\na term of 15 months imprisonment. As for the other offences, they may, absent\nthe possession for the purpose of trafficking, have commanded much more lenient\nsentences.In the circumstances, because nothing will flow from these\nsentences, I would vary these to concurrent terms of one month in jail.I\nwould not vary the probation and other orders.VII.Disposition[13]For these reasons, I would grant leave to\nappeal, allow the appeal and vary the conditional sentence to a terms of 15\nmonths imprisonment in a provincial jail commencing November 21, 2011, the date\nthe sentence was originally imposed. I would vary the other sentences to\nconcurrent terms of one month in jail.I would note the effect of R.T.S.\nwith respect to the calculation of the balance of any time Mr. Martin has\nleft to serve. Finally, the probation orders and all other ancillary orders\nimposed by the sentencing judge are unaffected._______________________________KATHLEEN A.

Patel, Q.C., for the\nCrown.Robert Carew, Esq., for the\nAccused.Copyright 2002Department of JusticeProvince of New\nBrunswickJUDGE’S COMMENTS ON SENTENCINGTHE COURT:Mr. Kuriya do you have anything to say before I sentence you?MR. KURIYA:Well, Your Honour, I’m very, very sorry for all\nthe (inaudible).THE COURT:Thank you.You have been convicted, Mr. Kuriya, by me of one count\nof fraud under Section 380(1)(a) of the Criminal Code of Canada.You\ndefrauded Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, ACOA, of some $840,699 in the\nmanner set out in my judgment of July 5th, 2002.It is not necessary to\ncompletely review the facts because, unlike the situation in a jury trial, I\nhave already done so in my judgment.It is sufficient to say that I found you\nmasterminded a continuing scheme to defraud ACOA of a substantial sum.To\nachieve that, you told ACOA, via fake invoices and cheques, that you had\npurchased new or substantially new machinery for a Bathurst, New Brunswick\nmanufacturing plant.In fact you bought used machinery or transferred\nmachinery from your other operations.This scheme obviously involved\nconsiderable planning on your part over a protracted period of time as well as\ndeceit on several fronts from the aforementioned cheques and invoices to the\nuse of adummy financial agency.You harmed many\npeople, particularly those who depended on the Plant’s success for their\nlivelihood.In sentencing, I am required\nto take Section 718 of the Criminal Code into account.That section\nsays:The\nfundamental purpose of sentencing is to contribute, along with crime\nprevention initiatives, to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just,\npeaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions that have one or more of\nthe following objectives:(a)to denounce unlawful conduct;(b)to deter the offender and other persons from committing offences;(c)to separate offenders from society, where necessary;(d)to assist in rehabilitating offenders;(e)to provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the\ncommunity; and(f)to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and\nacknowledgment of the harm done to victims and the community.718.1 says:A\nsentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of\nresponsibility of the offender.I recognize,\nas well, that 718.2 says:(d)\nan offender should not be deprived of liberty, if less restrictive sanctions\nmay be appropriate in the circumstances; …I have had the benefit of receiving a Pre-Sentence\nReport, which I have read, and material supplied by both counsel.I am\ngrateful for the manner in which the prosecution and defence presented their\ncases both at trial and here today.You have been throughout, Mr. Kuriya, ably\nrepresented.The material, in general, shows that you were\nhighly regarded in the business community, in your local community, and by\nother professionals.You understandably or undoubtedly, rather, have had a\nstellar career in the textile industry.In part, however, it was this ability\nto gain people’s trust and your experience that enabled you to obtain the loan\nfrom ACOA.In using that word “trust” I am not implying or suggesting that you\nwere in a position of trust as referred to in the Criminal Code.Your\nreputation and ability created an atmosphere conducive to accessing significant\namounts of money.Your lawyer has suggested that I give you a conditional\nsentence.In R. v. Proulx, 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), [2000] S.C.J. No. 6 the\nSupreme Court of Canada said that “The purpose of interpretation of Section\n742.1(a) creates a two stage test.First, it must be determined that a penitentiary\nterm is inappropriate; then it has to be considered if it is appropriate for\nthe offender to serve his sentence in the community.”I do not consider a\npenitentiary term to be inappropriate.In Ruby on Sentencing, (4th\nEdition) page 619 the author says:The offenders sentenced for fraud and related offences under the\nCriminal Code are a very diverse group of people and may be first offenders or\npractised criminals from a variety of economic backgrounds.Offences in this\narea frequently involve fairly sophisticated degrees of pre-planning and for\nthis reason exemplary sentences are seen to have some potential for deterrence\nin those cases where the offender is motivated by dispassionate greed.And I conclude on\nthe evidence that that was the case here.The high rate of “white collar” crimes committed by persons of prior\nexcellent reputation tends to blunt the otherwise mitigating effect of good\nbackground and many first offenders have received equally high sentences for\nsophisticated frauds.Here,\nit is evident the planning to defraud was in existence many months before you\nreceived cheques totaling almost a million dollars.Quite apart from the fact\nyou defrauded what amounts to the Canadian taxpayer, you caused or contributed\nto the dashing of the employment hopes of many people in the Bathurst area.It\nis not necessary for me to detail the aggravating and mitigating factors which\nhave been detailed this morning by Mr. Carew, and while I do not agree with all\nof them, he has substantially outlined them.In R.\nv. Basque, 1999 CanLII 9448 (NB CA), 211 N.B.R. (2d) 273 @ 292, which admittedly predated Proulx,\nMr. Justice Drapeau said in dealing with conditional sentence:Section 742.1 of the Code embodies the conviction of the\nParliament of Canada that a conditional sentence is a punishment that,\nin certain circumstances, could serve the best interests of society, and it has\nconferred significant discretion to the courts in imposing such sentences.This discretion should be exercised advisedly, ever mindful of the\ntruism stated in R. v. Shropshire (M.) … that “there is a very\nsignificant difference between living behind bars and functioning within\nsociety while on a conditional release.”As a general rule, a\nconditional sentence is such a lenient punishment that imposing such a sentence\nfor serious offences, both objectively and subjectively, cannot but undermine\npublic trust in the administration of justice.More importantly, sooner or\nlater, this sentencing provision will fall victim to its own misuse.In this\nregard, the remarks below, by the majority in Brady, … seem insightful\nto me and highlight another of the ill effects of indiscriminate use of this\ntype of sentencing:And he quotes:“One of the basic purposes of sentencing is preserving respect for\nthe law:s. 718.So we must avoid any approach undermining that\nrespect.Inculcating respect for the law is highly apposite in Canada today.It is no less important today than when the Code was last re-enacted in\n1953-54.Canada is a democracy, so the public will demand quick changes if\nthis new sentencing regime does not work.The public will be even more upset\nif the regime is applied in an undiscriminating manner, or in situations where\nit is counterproductive.The resulting outcry would not help convicted\npersons, still less their rehabilitation.”In\nmy view if I were to do anything but order incarceration, given the planning,\nthe deviousness and the amount of money involved, respect for the law would be\ndiminished.Here there is a need to denounce your conduct and to provide\ngeneral deterrence.See R. v. Chow [2001], Alberta Judgments No. 998;\nR. v. Ryan, 217 N.B.R. (2d) 287; and R. v. Gray, 1995 CanLII 18 (ON CA), 76 O.A.C. 387.Given\nthe dictates of Section 718 of the Criminal Code and the\nsubsequent sections, the circumstances surrounding the crime, which I have\nalready mentioned, I sentence you to serve a period of two years in a federal\nprison.There will be a recommendation that this be served in an institution\nin Eastern Ontario. In addition, you will be subject to a Restitution Order\npursuant to Section 738 of the Criminal Code in the amount of $840,699\nto Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency.Pursuant to Section 741 this amount\nshall be paid to ACOA forthwith, failing which that organization may file the\norder as a judgment in any civil court in Canada.Notice of this order will be\ngiven to ACOA by the Clerk of this Court.That is my sentence.Is there anything else\nMr. Patel?Mr. Carew?MR. CAREW:No.Could I ask that the materials be made\nexhibits on sentencing?THE COURT:Yes, I am going to do that.So the Pre-Sentence\nReport will be made an exhibit on sentencing, as well as Mr. Carew’s letter and\nthe separate exhibits.I use his letter because he outlines his argument\nthere.And the document attached to his letter, which will be one exhibit.Mr. Patel’s documents which were in a substantially looser form ―MR. PATEL:I’m sorry I didn’t bind them together.THE COURT:― will become another exhibit.Okay,\nso the three exhibits on sentencing.And that’s what you meant Mr. Carew?MR. CAREW:Yes.Thank you.(Exhibit No. 1 – Pre-Sentence Report)(Exhibit\nNo. 2 – Letter and attached documents from Mr. Carew)Exhibit No. 3 – Documents from Mr. Patel on\nSentencing)(Court\nadjourned @ 11:40 a.m.)"}

R.M.S.Date: 1990-02-13Docket: 1989 No. G.F. 106Between:Her Majesty the QueenandR.M.S.Woolridge, J.Counsel:Dan Peyton, for the Crown;Alan Carter, for R.M.S.[1]Woolridge, J. [orally]: Following trial the accused has been found\nguilty by a judge without a jury of two counts of incest and one count of gross\nindecency concerning his daughter, P., now age 17.[2]P. was born to the accused and his ex-wife in 1972, the eldest of four\nchildren. The family moved around a good deal and it was in Lloydminster,\nAlberta, that the accused commenced his sexual advances on his daughter who was\nthen only seven years old. She can still vividly recall being called out of bed\nby her father and being taught how to masturbate him. Soon she was taught to\nperform oral sex on the accused and was called on frequently to do so.[3]At the age of 10 or 11, P. moved back to Buchans, Newfoundland, with her\nfamily. By this time, in addition to the foregoing sexual acts, P. was introduced\nto anal sex and sexual intercourse by her father. All of these sexual attacks\nby the accused continued until he was put in jail when P. was age 15. His\nincarceration terminated his sexual attacks on his daughter for a two-year\nperiod. However, during Christmas of 1988 the accused was given the benefit of\na five-day release from jail. During his release he had sexual intercourse with\nP. Shortly thereafter P. made an attempt on her life and eventually these\ncurrent charges were laid.[4]In all, P. was systematically and regularly sexually abused by the\naccused over a nine-year period. One reason for the length of the abuse was\nthat two years ago P. ‘s younger sister, presently age 15, revealed that since\nthe age of 11 she had also been sexually abused by the accused. The accused was\ncharged with incest and pleaded guilty and was sentenced to one year in jail\nfor this offence, but the younger sister was rejected by some of her family for\nreporting her father, as well as reporting her paternal grandfather, who was\nalso charged with sexually abusing her. These charges were stayed due to the\nill health of the grandfather. P. was unwilling to suffer the same rejection\nand so remained silent for as long as she did.[5]The sexual abuse directed at this helpless child has had a profound\neffect upon her. Her own mother describes her in testimony as an unhappy little\ngirl with whom she fought a lot and whom she found hard to handle. She threw\ntantrums and lied a lot, unlike other children, and required frequent corporal punishment.\nShe had frequent nightmares.[6]In hindsight, having gained an insight into child sexual abuse from her\ndaughter’s counsellors and her own readings on abuse, the mother now feels that\nthe abuse had much to do with the unusual behaviour exhibited by P. as she grew\nup.[7]Following the last attack of abuse by the accused during Christmas of\n1988 at Buchans, P. became very depressed over the fact that at age 17, and\nafter a two-year abuse-free period, she still remained the victim of unwanted\nsexual attention by her father. She attempted suicide with a drug overdose and\nspent two weeks in the psychiatric ward of the hospital in Grand Falls. She was\nthen transferred to Emmanuel House at St. John’s, an institution that deals,\namong other things, with the counselling of victims of child sexual abuse in a\nsafe therapeutic setting.[8]In an excellent, but depressing, victim impact study, social worker,\nDianne Power Jeans reveals her opinion of the irreparable harm done to P. as a\nresult of the sexual abuse by the accused over the nine-year period, and I\nquote from page eight of her report:“The impact of child sexual abuse on its victims has been\nshown to be devastating. The effects that the incestuous relationship has had\non P. are profound.“We have seen may of P.’s symptoms and the impacts of incest,\nguilt, low esteem, depression, withdrawal, anger, fear, inability to trust,\nlack of self-confidence, drug abuse, P.’s feeling of personal powerlessness,\nand the abandonment of P. by her family.“The future for P. does not look bright. She lacks the esteem\nand confidence needed for self-motivation. She does not have any support from\nher family, friends, or community. Her inability to trust will be an obstacle\nto her therapeutic’ relationship, as well as personal relationships. The\nemotional impacts have the potential to be all-consuming.“P. is a very high risk for suicide. She has attempted in the\npast. She thinks about killing herself as ‘the only way’ to end the’ pain. P. is\nall alone, with no one she feels safe with to turn to. This possibility should\nnot be underestimated.“Revealing a major trauma, such as incest, and venting\nfeelings is just the beginning of the therapeutic process. P. is struggling\nwith unresolved conflicts.“P. must externalize all the emotions she has kept bottled up.\nShe must then place the responsibility for the incest with her father, where it\nbelongs.“P. must learn that although significant damage has been done\nto her dignity and sense of self-worth, she does not have to be psychologically\ncrippled for the rest of her life. She must be encouraged to invest the same\nenergy she has been putting into self-destructive behaviour into\nself-fulfilling behaviour. This encouragement should not only come from her\ncounsellor and friends, but from her family as well.“P. will likely spend many years in individual and group\ntherapy trying to overcome the impact of the incest. She will, however, feel\nthe effects for the rest of her life.”[9]I accept this report as reasonable and consistent with the evidence given\nboth by P. before me, and her mother.[10]A presentence report is also helpful. In the opinion of adult probation\nofficer Jeanette Maher, the accused, age 38, is a repeat offender who has been\nconvicted of conspiracy to traffic and trafficking in narcotics in 1985, and\neventually sentenced to six years imprisonment. In April of 1988, he was\nconvicted of sexual assault against his daughter, S., the younger sister of P.,\nand sentenced to a further one year. His release date is June 25, 1992.[11]His wife has now left him. He is a former drug abuser who rationalizes\nhis criminal behaviour and has little awareness of the scope of the damage\ninflicted on his daughter by his sexual abuse and who shows little if any\nremorse for what he has done, making only a passing reference to it in his\naddress to the court on sentence.[12]He has entered a program to address his obvious sexual deviance only\nafter being denied day parole. His motives are questionable at best and it must\nbe remembered that his last episode of sexual abuse of P. occurred while he was\non an ill-advised Christmas release.[13]In my opinion the evidence is clear that the accused is without remorse\nfor these repulsive sexual attacks on P., not to mention his other daughter S.[14]This finding is all the more offensive when we realize that throughout\nall of this behaviour the accused was acting in a position of trust as a\nparent.[15]The accused denies to Mrs. Maher any drug abuse problem, and regardless\nof overwhelming evidence to the contrary, including a guilty plea in the case\nof daughter S., exhibits no remorse for what he has done to his daughters. It\nis not surprising that Mrs. Maher concludes he is less than sincere and is not\na suitable candidate for probation, even to the extent of continuing to offend\nwhile incarcerated.[16]In the face of such a history any considerations of reform of the\noffender must give way to considerations and protection of the public and\ngeneral and specific deterrence of the accused.[17]Many cases have been cited to the court on the subject of sentence, and\nwill appear in the Appendix to this judgment. The maximum sentence for this\noffence is 14 years. Normally one would not impose such a sentence without\nevidence of aggravating factors to justify such a conclusion. In this case the\naggravating factors are as follows:1. The unenviable prior criminal record of the accused.2. The breach of position of trust as a parent.3. The accused is a repeat offender with respect to sexual\nassault on his daughter S.4. The last episode of incest occurred while the accused was\nin jail, but allowed out on a temporary Christmas absence, showing utter\ncontempt for the well-being of his daughter, and of the law in general.5. The lack of remorse in the accused.6. Finally, the devastating impact on the victim, P. Her\nchildhood has been destroyed, and her future is at best doubtful. The depth of\nher distress is best reflected in her suicide attempt and her uncertain future.[18]Under these circumstances the Crown seeks a sentence of eight to ten\nyears. The defence admits the severity of the offences, but suggests this\nsentence is too severe, and that four to five years is adequate.[19]In my view this is a very serious offence, and the Crown is correct that\na long period of incarceration is the only appropriate sentence that can be\nimposed because of the attitude of the accused. His continued denial of the\noffence, his lack of remorse, his behaviour while in jail, all mitigate against\nlenient sentence, and also show that probation is not a viable alternative. All\nthat can be done under these circumstances, if the accused cannot, or will not\nshow evidence of reform, is to instead make the best efforts one can to protect\nthe public and deter the accused from any repetition of such revolting behaviour.[20]On the two incest charges the accused is sentenced to a total period of\nimprisonment of five years. On the gross indecency charge the accused is\nsentenced to a period of imprisonment of two years. A total of seven years in\nall. Both sentences to be served consecutively and consecutively to any term\ncurrently being served.[21]The ban on publication will remain in effect in order to protect the\nname of the victim in this case.AppendixList Of Authorities1.

Humphrey for the appellant)Appellant)))Heard:August 25, 2006On appeal from the sentence imposed\nby Justice Donald J. Halikowski of the Ontario Court of Justice, dated October\n17, 2005SHARPE J.A.:[1]The appellant pleaded guilty to criminal negligence\ncausing death and was sentenced to twelve months imprisonment, two years\nprobation, and a five-year driving prohibition.Before this court, she seeks\nleave to appeal the custodial portion of her sentence.She submits that the\nsentencing judge erred by failing to give adequate consideration to a\nconditional sentence and asks this court to allow the appeal and substitute a\nconditional sentence.Circumstances of the Offence[2]The deceased, Derek Cameron, aged fifteen, was a close\nfriend of the appellant’s brother and a friend of the appellant.During the\nafternoon of March 23, 2005, the appellant made arrangements to pick up Derek\nCameron in her four-door Dodge Neon and then to get cigarettes.Calem Clark\nwas a passenger in the appellant’s vehicle.Derek was wearing roller blades.After picking up Derek and the cigarettes, the appellant returned to the\nresidential street where Derek lived.The posted speed limit was 40 kilometres\nper hour.Derek got out of the car and asked the appellant to tow him down the\nstreet.Derek went to the driver’s side of the vehicle while it was slowly\nmoving and interlocked arms with the appellant grabbing the pillar by the\ndriver’s window with his left hand.The appellant drove down the street at\napproximately 50 kilometres per hour towing Derek at the side of her car.Derek eventually let go and continued down the road while the appellant made a\nU-turn.On the return trip on the same street but in the opposite direction,\nDerek grabbed the pillar with both hands because the appellant had bruised her\narm during the first encounter.The appellant accelerated, rolled down the\nwindow and yelled out the speed she was reaching, eventually 80 kilometres per\nhour.Derek, apparently enjoying the thrill of the ride, yelled to the\npassenger: “Calem, look.”Derek then fell and was run over by the vehicle.He\nwas taken immediately to the hospital where he was pronounced dead as a result\nof severe blunt force trauma to his head.[3]Derek’s tragic death has had a devastating impact upon\nhis family and friends.He was bright, cheerful, and positive with a wide\ncircle of friends and activities.The victim impact statements filed by his\nparents and the evidence they offered at the sentencing hearing provide moving\nand poignant testimony of the irreparable loss they have suffered.Circumstances of the Offender[4]The appellant was twenty years old at the time of the\noffence with an unblemished record.She and her family had been close friends\nwith Derek and his family.A pre-sentence report provided a positive review of\nthe appellant’s family background and developmental history.The appellant has\na younger brother and had a happy and stable childhood, although there may have\nbeen some tension in her relationship with her father because of the long hours\nhe worked.The appellant’s mother indicated that the appellant had a tendency\nto make poor judgment calls with her friends and that she would do anything to\nplease her friends.The report from the appellant’s psychologist suggested\nthat these past transgressions were within the range of normal adolescent\nbehaviour and that any lack of judgment would improve with age and experience.The appellant had no other history of behavioural problems and took school and\nwork seriously.She graduated from secondary school in 2004.At the time of\nsentencing she was enrolled in a two-year Human Services Counsellor program at\nDurham College.Since graduating from high school, she had consistently\nmaintained employment.At the time of sentencing she was working part time as\na customer service associate at Home Sense where she had received three awards\nfor outstanding service.[5]In his reasons for sentence, the sentencing judge\ndescribed the appellant in the following terms:Tonya Kutsukake by all accounts is a typical young Canadian female.Her pre-sentence report reveals her upbringing to have been stable.Her\nparents are hardworking individuals who have always tried their best to raise\ntheir two children while maintaining as comfortable a lifestyle as they could\npossibly do for them.…The accused is young, intelligent and presents a good\nfuture.She is presently in college and works part-time at a local retail\nstore, the manager of which has assessed her performance as good to outstanding\nand speaks highly of her integrity and congeniality.Letters confirm her good\ncharacter.Put succinctly there is simply no articulable reason why Tonya\nKutsukake should find herself before this court facing this kind of charge and\nyet here she is.Her actions have devastated the lives of the Cameron family\nas shown in the victim impact statements of Derek Cameron’s mother and father.[6]The appellant took responsibility for her actions and\npleaded guilty.Her psychologist’s report indicated that, as a result of\nDerek’s death, the appellant had shown signs of acute stress disorder and\npost-traumatic stress disorder and that she was experiencing strong feelings of\nguilt.The appellant expressed her remorse at the sentencing hearing.Moreover, the psychologist’s report, the pre-sentence report, and the arresting\nofficer all indicated that the appellant was genuinely remorseful for her\nactions.The sentencing judge found that the effects of the appellant’s\nactions “have been brought home to her by various means” and that “[s]he has\naccepted responsibility for what she has done and this act was a singular act\nof recklessness – instantly regretted.”Reasons for Sentence[7]At the sentencing hearing, the appellant’s counsel\nsubmitted that a conditional sentence of imprisonment of two years less a day\nwas appropriate.Crown counsel submitted that the court should consider a\nsentence of eighteen months imprisonment, followed by two years probation, and\na five to seven year driving prohibition.[8]The sentencing judge gave relatively detailed reasons\nfor the sentence he imposed.He found that the appellant “clearly knew the\ndanger to which she was exposing this young man and for reasons that are only\nknown to her, she recklessly chose not to maintain that level of danger but to\nincrease it by travelling even faster on the second run.”On the other hand,\nthe sentencing judge was satisfied that the accused “is not dishonest and she\nis not physically aggressive” and that “[s]he poses no danger to society in her\nday-to-day dealings”.The sentencing judge further concluded that the\nappellant “does not now and will not within the next two years pose a danger to\nthe community.”[9]He found that the nature of the offence, the absence of\nalcohol, and the “young age of the accused” all militated against a\npenitentiary term.The sentencing judge determined, however, that the actions\nof the accused “must be sharply denounced to deter other like-minded people\nfrom following the same tragic route.”He added:The sentence must also acknowledge, in no uncertain terms, the\neffects that such a crime has on the victims.For not only has Derek Cameron\nlost his life, but his family, friends and society generally have been altered\nand redirected in such a fashion as to cause great emotional trauma and a sense\nof waste for opportunities that now have been lost.[10]The sentencing judge gave only the following reason for\nconcluding that a conditional sentence was not appropriate: “this court finds\nthat a conditional sentence will not satisfy the requirements for denunciation,\ndeterrence and the recognition of the effects of this crime on the victims.”[11]While the appellant eventually was released on bail\npending appeal, as of the date of the hearing, she had served forty-one days in\ncustody.Analysis[12]It is well established that the sentence imposed by the\nsentencing judge is to be accorded deference on appeal and that this court will\nnot interfere unless the sentence is demonstrably unfit or the sentencing\njudge’s reasons reveal an error of law or an error in principle.[13]With respect, I have concluded that in the tragic\ncircumstances of this case, the sentencing judge erred in principle: (1) by\nfailing to consider seriously whether or not a conditional sentence could\nsatisfy the needs of denunciation and general deterrence; and (2) by failing to\ngive any weight to the established principle that when sentencing a youthful\nfirst offender the primary objective should be rehabilitation and specific\ndeterrence.[14]I will deal first with the appropriateness of a\nconditional sentence to satisfy the needs of denunciation and general\ndeterrence.On the findings of the sentencing judge, the statutory\nprerequisites for a conditional sentence are met in this case: (i) there is no\nminimum term of imprisonment, (ii) the appropriate sentence is of two years\nless a day or less, and (iii) the safety of the community would not be\nendangered by the offender serving her sentence in the community.[15]In the leading case of R. v. Proulx (2000), 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), 140\nC.C.C. (3d) 449 (S.C.C.), the Supreme Court of Canada directed that where the\nstatutory criteria have been considered, “serious” consideration must be given\nto determine whether a conditional sentence would be consistent with the\nfundamental purpose and principles of sentencing.The Supreme Court of Canada\nheld, at para. 114, that even in the presence of aggravating factors which\nmight indicate the need for denunciation and deterrence, “a conditional\nsentence may provide sufficient denunciation and deterrence, even in cases in\nwhich restorative objectives are of diminished importance”.Writing for the\ncourt, Lamer C.J.C. added at para. 100:A conditional sentence can achieve both punitive and restorative\nobjectives.To the extent that both punitive and restorative objectives can be\nachieved in a given case, a conditional sentence is likely a better sanction\nthan incarceration.Where the need for punishment is particularly pressing,\nand there is little opportunity to achieve any restorative objectives,\nincarceration will likely be the more attractive sanction.However, even where\nrestorative objectives cannot be readily satisfied, a conditional sentence will\nbe preferable to incarceration in cases where a conditional sentence can\nachieve the objectives of denunciation and deterrence as effectively as\nincarceration.This follows from the principle of restraint in s. 718.2(d) and\n(e), which militates in favour of alternatives to incarceration where\nappropriate in the circumstances.[16]Lamer C.J.C. also stated, in para. 115, that “it would be\na mistake to rule out the possibility of a conditional sentence ab initio\nsimply because aggravating features are present.I repeat that each case must\nbe considered individually.”The Supreme Court of Canada specifically stated,\nat para. 41, that a conditional sentence is capable of achieving the objectives\nof denunciation and deterrence, “particularly in circumstances where the\noffender is forced to take responsibility for his or her actions and make\nreparations to both the victim and the community, all the while living in the\ncommunity under tight controls.”[17]The sentencing judge declared that denunciation and\ndeterrence ruled out a conditional sentence but he failed to explain why.In\nmy view, the sentencing judge made the very error identified by the Supreme\nCourt, at para. 115, namely, he “rule[d] out the possibility of a conditional\nsentence ab initio simply because aggravating factors are present.”[18]I turn to the second point, namely the principle\nestablished by this court in R. v. Stein (1974), 15 C.C.C. (2d) 376\n(Ont. C.A.) and R. v. Priest (1996), 1996 CanLII 1381 (ON CA), 110 C.C.C. (3d) 289 (Ont. C.A.),\nthat the primary objectives in sentencing a youthful first offender are\nindividual deterrence and rehabilitation.A sentence imposed on a youthful\nfirst offender should constitute the minimum necessary sanction that is\nadequate, community-based dispositions must be considered, and more serious\nforms of punishment imposed only where necessary.These principles have since\nbeen codified in ss. 718(c), 718.2(d) and 718.2(e) of the Criminal Code.While the sentencing judge took into account the appellant’s age in deciding\nthat a lengthy penitentiary sentence was not called for, his reasons indicate\nthat he did not give any weight to her age and unblemished record when considering\nwhether to impose a conditional sentence.[19]In view of these errors, it is open to this court to\nimpose what we deem to be an appropriate sentence.In s. 718 of the Criminal\nCode, Parliament directs us to consider the following objectives when imposing\nsentence:(a)to denounce unlawful conduct;(b)to deter the offender and other persons from committing offences;(c)to separate offenders from society, where necessary;(d)to assist in rehabilitating offenders;(e)to provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the community;\nand(f)to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and\nacknowledgment of the harm done to victims and to the community.As already mentioned, the principle adopted in s. 718.2(d) is also\napplicable here: “an offender should not be deprived of liberty, if less\nrestrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances”.[20]In my view, the only purpose to be served by requiring\nthe appellant to serve her sentence in an institution would be denunciation of\nthe unlawful conduct.That factor does not, in the circumstances of this case,\noutweigh the other factors that point to a conditional sentence.Moreover, I\nam of the view that denunciation of the unlawful conduct can be achieved\nwithout the appellant returning to jail.She has seen the inside of a prison\nand has served forty-one days in custody.I am persuaded that an additional\nsentence to be served in the community under the conditions described below\nwill serve as sufficient denunciation of her conduct, consistent with the principles\nestablished in Proulx, supra.[21]I am satisfied that a custodial sentence is not\nrequired for specific deterrence.The appellant has certainly learned her\nlesson and does not pose a risk of re-offending.[22]Turning to general deterrence, there is no doubt that\nthe lethal risks posed by excessive speed and thrill seeking on the part of\nyoung drivers make this an important consideration in this case. We must do\nwhat we can to bring this message home.The appellant suggests that an\nappropriate term of a conditional sentence would be a requirement that she\nspeak at schools and to young people about the dangers of thrill-seeking\nconduct of the kind in which she engaged and the devastation it can bring.In\nmy view, that would have a much more powerful deterrent effect on other young\npeople than having the appellant serve a further period of incarceration.[23]The appellant does not pose a risk of re-offending and\nit is not necessary, therefore, to separate her from society.Her\nrehabilitation would plainly be better served by a conditional sentence.With\nrespect to reparation, no sentence we can impose could ever make up for the\ndevastating loss of Derek Cameron.The promotion of a sense of responsibility\nwould, in my view, be served by a sentence that requires the young person who\ncaused his death to acknowledge publicly her wrongdoing through a form of\ncommunity service that will warn others of the devastating consequences of\nparticipating in reckless thrill-seeking behaviour.[24]Accordingly, I would grant leave to appeal and allow\nthe appeal against the sentence of twelve months imprisonment.In its place I\nwould substitute a conditional sentence of eighteen months, taking into account\nthe fact that the appellant has already served forty-one days in custody.The\nfirst nine months of the conditional sentence are to be served in the form of\nhouse arrest, the appellant being permitted to leave her house only as may be\nrequired for employment, school, medical or legal appointments, and religious\nobservance, and between the hours of 9 a.m. and 12 noon on Saturdays to attend\nto personal shopping and other needs.The remaining nine months are to be\nserved under the compulsory statutory conditions prescribed by s. 742.3(1).In\naddition, I would require the appellant to perform 240 hours of community\nservice as directed by her probation officer and direct that, to the extent\npossible, a significant portion of that community service be in the form of\nspeaking at schools or other like institutions about the dangers of her\nconduct.I would not interfere with the two years probation or with the five\nyear driving prohibition.“Robert\nJ.

No. 2407Between:Her Majesty the QueenandJ.M.Hickman, C.J.T.D.Counsel:Rachel A. Huntsman, for the Crown;John Duggan, for the accused.[1]Hickman, C.J.T.D.: The accused, J.M., has pleaded guilty to three\ncounts of indecent assault committed against three persons when they were in\ntheir pre or early teens. As a result of his guilty plea, J.M. stands convicted\nof one count of two separate acts of indecent assault against his\nsister-in-law, T.N., one count of indecent assault against his nephew, E.M.,\nand one count of indecent assault against his brother-in-law, J.N.[2]The indecent assaults against E.M. by his uncle, the accused,\nJ.M., commenced when E.M. was approximately 10 years of age. At that time E.M.,\nhis mother, M. (a sister of the accused) and E.M.’s siblings were living with\nthe accused’s parents in St. John’s. They subsequently lived, for some months,\nin Portugal Cove, Newfoundland. The victim’s father was working in the Far East at the time, and for that reason E.M.’s mother moved to Newfoundland from the United States with her children to reside with her relatives during her husband’s absence.\nM. and her children lived with her parents in St. John’s for approximately two\nyears and the accused also lived with them. The assaults against E.M. were\nperpetuated by the accused during the period they were all living in the same\nhouse in St. John’s.[3]E.M. was approximately 10 years of age when he, together with his\nmother and siblings, arrived in Newfoundland around 1966 and moved in with his\ngrandparents and his uncle, J.M., in a house situate Carew Street, St. John’s. The indecent assaults committed by the accused against E.M. occurred\napproximately once or twice a week for approximately one year and each incident\nlasted for about 15 minutes. E.M. when testifying at the preliminary inquiry\ndescribed the assaults as follows:-“He- I don’t know exactly how it got started but he would take\nme up to the third floor and he would, you know, he would take my clothes off,\nhe would take his clothes off and basically for the most part he would have me\nlay down flat on my stomach and he would, you know, rub his penis in my butt\nuntil he ejaculated. Sometimes he would make me ejaculate him. I only remember\nit one time that he put his mouth on mine, only one time.”[4]On one occasion the accused performed fellatio upon E.M. On four\nor five occasions the accused had E.M. masturbate him.[5]The accused admonished E.M. not to tell anyone of these instances\nand suggested to E.M. that no one would believe him if he did make such\ndisclosures. Eventually, E.M. told his mother who confronted her brother with\nthese allegations. The accused denied any wrongdoing. E.M.’s mother was most\ndistressed and upset over the allegations made by her son and because of his\nconcern over his mother’s distress, E.M. later told her that nothing had really\nhappened. It was not until E.M. reported the indecent assaults to his mother\nand she confronted her brother that the accused ceased his criminal acts\nagainst his nephew.[6]T.N., who now resides in Vancouver, British Columbia, was\nindecently assaulted by the accused, her brother-in-law, on two occasions. The\nfirst assault occurred when T.N. was between seven and nine years of age and\ntook place at Curling Place, St. John’s, Newfoundland. At that time T.N. was\nvisiting her sister and the accused, J.M., for a short holiday. T.N. was lying\non the living room floor watching television. The accused came into the living\nroom and as T.N. testified at the preliminary inquiry:-“He lay on my left side and reached with his left hand and\nstarted rubbing his fingers on my private area and I told him big girls like\nthat maybe, you know, I don’t. Like, I couldn’t understand what he was doing it\nfor. And he said, asked me if I was sure about that and I said, “Yes”. It was a\nvery short incident, very short segment of time. And the door, someone was at\nthe door and it was my sister, E. coming home, so he stopped, got up.”[7]The accused did not remove his clothes during this incident. He\nhand remained on top of T.N.’s nightdress causing it to “bunch up” between her\nlegs. The incident lasted about two minutes and the accused stopped when T.N.’s\nsister E.N. returned to the home.[8]The second assault against T.N. was committed by the accused when\nshe was 12 years of age and occurred at [name of place omitted], Newfoundland. The accused, who had been living in Alberta at the time, had returned to Newfoundland for a visit. T.N. testified at the preliminary inquiry that the following\noccurred:-“A.I was in\nthe back yard. I was feeding the chickens some green grass stalks and he came\nup in the back yard and asked me to scratch his back, which I didn’t think\nanything big. You know, I scratch my brother’s back all the time, and stuff,\ntoo. And I said, ‘Sure;. And I scratched his back and made, you know, small\nconversation about chickens, and stuff. And then someone called out that it was\nsup-pertime, so we all, you know, we went down for supper. There was six or\nseven of us there. We ate. My parents went to Bingo that night, as they most,\nthey often did. My brother L., and L. were out.A.So after\neverybody had left I went up to use the washroom and when I came out of the\nwashroom my brother, L.’s room, where J.M. was, was to the right of the door\nand he asked me to scratch his back. So I thought, sure. He went in and lay\ndown on the bed sort of, you know, on his stomach but up on one arm. And I\nscratched his back and he said that was sort of good and then he grabbed me and\nhe pulled my arms up till I slip up alongside of him and was wedged and then he\nrolled over on top of me.Q.Okay. So\nwere you on your back at that point, when he rolled over on top of you?A.Yes I\nwas.Q.Alright.\nGo ahead.A.I was\naware of, you know, the sun was starting to fade into the horizon because the\nway shadows were on the wall there was dust floating around in there. I guess I\nwas starting to go a little numb. I was upset. And he started to kiss me and it\ntasted like cigarettes and booze, beer - I don’t know what the hell he had been\ndrinking.Q.Kiss you\nwhere?A.On the\nlips. And I started to cry and (indiscernible) stop him and he pulled up my\nshirt and started to suck at my nipples. I was still crying and he sort of asked\nme what’s wrong, and his tone sounded a little angry, and I was scared. So I\nsaid, ‘My dog died a couple of weeks ago so I’m a little upset’, figuring that\nmight, I don’t know, make him stop, because I was upset - but he didn’t. He\ntold me he could make me feel better and he sort of sat me up but kept one arm\nsort of on his hand just to - It wasn’t like a really tight grip, but it was\nfirm enough. And he unzipped his pants and pulled out his penis. He was erect\nand he said, ‘Suck it’. I said, ‘No’. And he kept pushing my head towards it\nand I kept crying and said, ‘No’. And he, -I looked at him and he was smiling\nlike. I felt totally useless.Q.What do\nyou mean, he was smiling like what?A.Smiling\nlike a -- sick. So this when [sic] on for awhile. I resisted. I closed my eyes\nsometimes, because I didn’t want to look at it.Q.What\nwent on for awhile?A.This\npushing.Q.Yeah.\nTrying to make you, -A.Yeah -\nget a little closer.THE COURT: The record will note that the witness gestured by\npushing the back of her own head with her hand.A.And\nafter that I, we heard - I heard the door slam downstairs and you could hear\nvoices and I knew, you know, the tones, it was my brothers. And he started\npushing me away and I went through the door and he told me that, you know,\n‘It’s your fault. It’s our little secret. I won’t tell if you won’t.’A.My two\nbrothers came in and he sort of pushed me away.Q.He\npushed you away. What do you mean?A.Yeah,\nsort of this -- You know, not like a had [sic] push or anything but just sort\nof like let me go, because I was always trying to sort of get away. And he told\nme at the door that it was, you know, my fault; it was our secret; you don’t\ntell, I won’t tell, no one will have to know - like it was my fault.Q.Yeah. So\nwhat did you do then?A.I went\ndownstairs and I was crying, still crying. And J. and G., you know, being like\nbrothers - What’s wrong with you? And I said - Jake just died a couple of weeks\nago. That was the dog. And I told them that so I wouldn’t have to tell.”[9]It is significant, that once again, the accused admonished his\nyoung sister-in-law to keep the incidents a secret and attempted to place the\nblame for his criminal act upon T.N.[10]The third complainant, J.N., grew up in [name of place omitted], Newfoundland. He is the brother-in-law of the accused. On one occasion when J.N. was\nbetween the age of 11 and 12, he visited St. John’s and was staying at Valleyview Apartments with his older sister E.N. and the accused\n(her spouse at the time). J.N. slept in the apartment on a pullout daybed. He\nawoke during the night to find the accused on top of him and the accused was\nmasturbating J.N. His hands were beneath J.N.’s underwear. J.N. told the\naccused to get off him which he did. Following the incident, the accused told\nJ.N. not to tell his sister. J.N. disclosed the assault a few years later to\nboth his sister E.N. and his parents but his parents advised him to say nothing\nabout it. J.N. was upset over this incident. He does not know how long the\naccused was on top of him before he awoke but he estimates that he was on top\nof him for a couple of minutes after he awakened.[11]The accused testified at the sentence hearing. He is 55 years of\nage. The accused is permanently resident in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories\nwhere he has resided for the past eight years. The accused is employed as a\nsalesman with Johnson’s Building Supplies Limited, Yellowknife with whom he has\nworked since September 1990. His employer has confirmed by letter dated December 10, 1997 and admitted in evidence by consent that J.M. is an excellent employee\nwho “gets along well with staff members and customers. Should the occasion\narise, we will hold his position for four months”. The accused and his wife\nlive in rented accommodation in a building owned by his employer. His gross\nannual salary is $45,000.00.[12]The accused married E.N. in 1968 and there were two children of\nthe marriage who are now 29 and 27 years of age. J.M. and E.N. separated in\n1979 and were subsequently divorced. The accused has not maintained any\nsignificant contact with the two children of that marriage. Approximately 17\nyears ago, the accused married his present wife, E., who had been divorced and\nat that time had three children from a previous marriage, namely two boys, one\nfour years of age and the other 11 and a daughter who was nine years old at\nthat time. In a written statement dated December 29, 1997, and admitted in evidence by consent, E. wrote that the accused assumed the role of father\nto her three children and was and still is a very caring husband.and caring\nfather to her three children. The three stepchildren, now in their twenties, no\nlonger live at home with the accused and his wife. E. is employed as an\nattendant at an addiction treatment centre in Yellowknife and her net income is\n$800.00 every two weeks.[13]The accused testified that he began consuming alcohol at age 10\nand has been an alcoholic since he was 12 years of age. He quit school at age\n14. J.M. has been a member of Alcoholic Anonymous for the past 18 years and while\nhe has participated on a continuing basis in the programs of that organization,\nhe did suffer some relapses from time to time. He has been alcohol free for the\nlast three years. The accused does not suggest that his problems with alcohol,\nat the time he committed the crimes of which he stands convicted, constitute a\nvalid excuse for his conduct but suggests same may constitute an explanation\nfor his deviant behaviour.[14]I am satisfied from the evidence of the accused and the several\nreports of professionals and others in Yellowknife, filed by consent, that J.M.\nis making a valiant attempt to rehabilitate himself and to continue his\nrecovery from alcoholism. The accused, at one period in his life, had a problem\nwith gambling and again he is dealing with that addiction through appropriate\ntreatment. The accused has completed treatment at the Hay River Treatment\nCentre in the Northwest Territories and is continuing treatment for his.\naddictions with the Northern Addictions Centre. Doctor R.W. Wheeler, a psychriatist,\nwith the Northern Addictions Services, wrote as follows concerning J.M.:-“29/12/97To Whom it May ConcernRe: J.M.I’ve known J.M. for several years professionally. He has made\na sustained and consistent effort to bring his addictions under control. He\nattends self help recovery groups and a clinical aftercare group. He has been\nof good character and has an honest desire to make amends for his past\nbehaviours. He will continue to do these recovery activities after his trial.R.W. Wheeler M.D. (Signed)”[15]Gerald J. Brown of Northern Addiction Services, Yellowknife, by\nletter dated December 8, 1997, summarized the treatment and progress made by\nthe accused as fol-lows:-“I have been seeing J.M. for the past three years as his\ncounsellor and spiritual director. Over that period of time J.M. is attending\nA.A. meetings and is till dealing with compulsive behaviours; ie., gambling,\nalcohol.“J.M. is quiet upset and very angry with himself for his past\nactions. He wished that at this time in his life that he could make amends for\nhis past. My sense is that J.M. is contrite and would like to continue\ntreatment for his addictions, ie. Alcohol, gambling, and even though he is not\naware that past behaviour with inappropriate sexual encounters could be\nconsidered sexual addiction is willing to participate in a treatment program. Homewood in Guelph, Ontario have just such a program. J.M. is in very good standing with\nthe City of Yellowknife, and with the Parish of St. Patrick’s Church. Both he\nand his wife attend church regulary.“Mr. Duggen if you should have any\nother questions concerning J.M. please do not hesitate to call.Respectfully,Gerald J. Brown (Signed)Mr. Gerald J. Brown”[16]J.M. stated that he is prepared to participate in a treatment\nprogram offered by Homewood situate Guelph, Ontario which program is referred\nto in the report of Northern Addictions Services.[17]The Alcoholics Anonymous organization in Yellowknife confirmed\nthat the accused is a frequent attender at meetings and\nthat he has “now embarked on a new life of sobriety and responsibility”. In\naddition to participating in the advance program of that organization, the\naccused is involved almost every evening and on weekends in helping others who\nare participating in the AA program.[18]T.N. has filed an impact statement which is very compelling and\nsatisfies me that the effect of the accused’s criminal acts toward her have\nbeen very traumatic and permanently debilitating. She commenced her statement\nas follows:-“To write this statement about how I have been affected, by\nwhat happened to as a child, is to say the least: difficult. Reliving the\nfeelings of shame, fear, mistrust, anger and thoughts of suicide all seem like\na bad dream.“As a child, I felt loved, secure and protected. Everything\nwas magical as only they can be for a child. I was doing quite well in school\nand had many friends, who I thought highly of. All in all, a normal life.”[19]In her impact statement, T.N. says that as a result of the\nassaults committed upon her by the accused, she has lost her self-worth, her\nattitude toward men has been seriously affected and she developed an\nunsatisfactory relationship with her late parents which continues to trouble\nher. Her education was adversely affected and she did not complete high school.\nIn describing the effect, T.N. stated:-“I started smoking marijuana shortly after the second\nincident. I was 12.1 did not get high the first few times, but then one night I\ndid. The euphoria created by the drug would calm and numb me. I stopped\nstudying anything related to school. My grades went from A’s to C’s,\nD’s to F’s. I knew that my good grades made my parents able to brag to\ntheir friends, so I thought what would that do for me. And the answer was\nnothing. I no longer wanted to be a success. So, I smoked marijuana for 20\nyears.”[20]T.N. summarized the effects of the impact of her being assaulted\nby the accused as follows: -“Everything culminated for me in the summer of my 31st year.\nAfter living this way for close to twenty horrible years of subsistence, I was tired\nof it. A friend of mine, D., who was molested by her stepfather as a child,\ngave me a pamphlet. I phoned and made an appointment at this counselling\ncenter. You go in for a pre-interview. Then you have to wait for eight weeks\nbefore you get started. I had already planned my suicide you see, so if I did\nnot like what happened in the pre-interview session, I was going to take my\nlife the next day.”[21]She concludes her statement as follows“The regrets I have about all this, that I will indeed carry\nto my grave are: I did not have much time to reconnect with my parents in a\nloving manner. I did not tell them over the years how I loved them, even though\nI was desperate to. They were elderly and sick. I managed to tell them both as\nthey lay dying. My father was unable to communicate because of his advanced\nParkinson’s Disease. He was twisting the sheets in his hands as I was leaving.\nThat picture always makes me cry. He died October 17, 1996. My mother and I would talk every week on Sundays, making up for lost time. She joined my\nfather on August 1, 1997 - 30 days before the preliminary hearing.“As for financially, who knows potentially what I could have\ndone with my life. I could become a doctor, a star on a Broadway stage, a\nmissionary doing wonderful deeds of humanitarianism, or just a loving wife or\nmother. Presently, I am about to embark on going to school. I hope to have a\nviable talent that will allow me to make up for lost time and feel fulfilled.\nAs for children, even though my husband would love to be a father, I will not\nbring one into the world. I am scared of what is out there. I fear they would\ngrow up like I did and I would not wish that for my worst enemy.”[22]Impact statements were not filed by or on behalf of the other\nvictims. However, failure to file an impact statement by a victim of sexual\nassault, is not a mitigating factor. In R. v. C.B.B. (1994),\n1994 CanLII 9763 (NL CA), 114 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 178; 356 A.P.R. 178, in the sentencing process, the\nNewfoundland Court of Appeal said at p. 180:-“Another point which must be made is that while direct\nevidence of victim impact may constitute an aggravating factor in sentencing an\noffender, the absence of such evidence is never a mitigating factor. I am\nunsure however whether the trial judge considered it so here.”[23]I have no difficulty in concluding that the impact of the\naccused’s criminal acts towards his nephew, E.M., which occurred on a frequent\nbasis over a period of approximately one year when the victim was 10 years of\nage must have had a traumatic effect upon him which was undoubtedly aggravated\nby the understandable distress caused to his mother when she was appraised of\nthe deviant behaviour of her brother.[24]Counsel for the Crown submitted that sentences totalling three\nyears is appropriate to the culpability of the accused as they relate to the\nsexual assaults. Counsel for the accused, on the other hand, suggested that the\ntotal sentence should be in the range between 12 to 18 months. If it was\ndetermined that a sentence of less than two years is appropriate, counsel for\nthe accused would then ask that such sentence be conditional. For reasons to\nfollow I am of the view that the facts of this case do not warrant a\nconditional sentence.[25]This case involves sexual assaults against three young persons.\nThe nature of the assaults and the extent of same varies from one victim to the\nother. The assaults committed move from the lower end of the scale in the case\nof the assault against J.N. to the higher end of the scale in the case of E.M.[26]It is appropriate to deal with the assaults against each victim\nseparately and to impose appropriate sentences on each count bearing in mind\nthe totality principle and ensuring that while the sentence for each offence\nshould be appropriate that a proper totality should be achieved.[27]Count No. 2 reads:-“THAT J.M. between the 26th day of February, A.D.,\n1971, and the 26th day of February, A.D., 1977, at or near [name of place\nomitted] and St. John’s in the Province of Newfoundland, did indecently assault\nT.N., a female person, contrary to sections 141 and 149 of the Criminal\nCode.”[28]At the time the first offence particularized in Count No. 2 was\ncommitted, the victim was between seven and nine years of age. While the\nassault was of short duration and minimum force was used, the act of the\naccused was intrusive and clearly traumatic from the victim’s point of view.[29]In perpetrating the second sexual assault particularized in Count\nNo. 2, when the same victim, T.N., was 12 years of age, the accused used an\nunacceptable amount of force and the nature of his assault against the victim\nwas most reprehensible. There was a clear attempt by the accused to force T.N.\nto participate in deviant sexual acts and such acts places that assault toward\nthe higher end of the scale. It is clear from the testimony of T.N. that her\nbrother-in-law, the accused, tried to take advantage of her youthful innocence\nby suggesting to her that the activity he was attempting to engage in would\nmake her feel better and then when halting his criminal acts because of the\narrival of other persons, he tried to throw the blame upon his unsuspecting\nvictim.[30]The impact statement filed by T.N. describes very graphically the\nsuffering she has endured since she was subjected to these acts of criminality\nby her brother-in-law which has had a very deleterious effect upon her\nexistence and has prevented her from living a normal life.[31]Count No. 3 reads:-“THAT J.M. between the 01st of January, A.D., 1971, and\nthe 08th day of July, A.D., 1973, at or near St. John’s, in the Province ofNewfoundland, being a male person, did indecently assault J.N., a male person, contrary to section 156 of the Criminal Code.”[32]The amount of physical force used by the accused in performing\nhis indecent assault upon J.N. was minimal. The lack of force does not\nnecessarily take away the seriousness of the intrusive act of sexual assault\nbut rather force when used should be regarded as an aggravating factor rather\nthan treating a lack of same as a mitigating element. It must be kept in mind\nthat in cases of sexual assault against young persons that even if there is\nabsence of physical force the psychological force inflicted upon the innocent\nvictim must of necessity be a very compelling factor in determining an\nappropriate sentence. The fact that J.N. was of a very tender age when\nvictimized by the accused leads to the irresistible conclusion that such\nexperience must have left an unsavory but lasting impression upon him.[33]Count No. 5 reads:-“THAT J.M. between the 26th day of May, A.D., 1965, and\nthe 26th day of May, A.D., 1967, at or near St. John’s, in the Province ofNewfoundland, being a male person, did indecently assasult E.M., a male\nperson, contrary to section 148 of the Criminal Code.”[34]The acts committed against E.M. when he was between the age of 10\nand 11 were on a continuing basis and over a period of one year. While there is\nno evidence of excessive force being used, the fact that acts of simulated anal\nintercourse occurred once or twice a week over a period of one year, that on\none occasion the accused performed fellatio upon E.M. and on four or five\noccasions had E.M. masturbate him places these assaults in a very serious\ncategory.[35]In reviewing the totality of the criminal activity of the accused\nas they relate to the three victims, I conclude that a position of family trust\nexisted in relation to all three victims and that the accused took advantage of\nsuch position of trust to force himself upon his unsuspecting victims. It ill\nbehooves one who has destroyed the innocence of young children to ask this\nCourt to place undue emphasis upon the lack of force used in the commission of\nsuch nefarious crimes.[36]In arriving at appropriate sentences in this case, it is my view\nthat the principle of general deterrence must play a very significant role. The\npredominent consideration when imposing a sentence upon\na person found guility of sexually assaulting young persons is that it must be\nmade clear to the offender and to the public that courts will not tolerate such\noffensive activity and will continue to send a message that society abhors such\nacts and that young victims of same will receive the protection of the court\ninsofar as such protection can be afforded under the principle of general\ndeterrence. The Court of Appeal of Newfoundland in R. v. J.N.O. (1993),\n1993 CanLII 7746 (NL CA), 103 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 256; 326 A.P.R. 256, articulated the principle of\ngeneral deterrent in cases of sexual assault against children at p. 259 as\nfollows:-“The idea that the principal purpose of the criminal process,\nincluding imposition of sentence, is the protection of society -- protection of\nthe public -- is doubtlessly correct, but it is a notion that is not too\nhelpful until circumscribed and explained in the light of a particular case. It\nsoon becomes clear that sentences in child sexual abuse cases are directed towards\nthe protection of children, often females, ordinarily too innocent and\nvulnerable to protect themselves. In R. v. W.B.J.; R. v. M.P. (1992),\n1992 CanLII 2761 (AB CA), 127 A.R. 65; 20 W.A.C. 65, 73 C.C.C. (3d)\n530, the Alberta Court of Appeal discussed in some detail sentence principles\nand appropriate sentences in child sexual abuse cases. In its conclusions\ncommencing at p. 549 the court stated in part:‘Sentencing of an accused person (it will usually be a man, so\nwe will speak of a man) for major sexual assault on a child will be based\nmainly on the principles of general deterrence (the hope that the sentence will\ndeter other persons from engaging in such acts) and denunciation (the sentence\nexpresses the community’s condemnation of such conduct and society’s need to\nreinforce the simple principle that it will not tolerate abuse of power and\nbreach of trust by a person vis-à-vis a child). On a\nlesser scale the sentence to be imposed will express the court’s hope that the\nsentence will teach the accused himself not to engage in similar unusual acts\nagain, a hope that will often be slender because sexual abuse of children may\nbe the outward expression of an accused’s severe emotional difficulties.\nFinally, the court may by its sentence provide an opportunity to rehabilitate\nthe accused, but this possibility will often not be regarded as significant,\nnor will it be of paramount concern in view of the inadequacy of institutional\ntherapy and the negative impact upon the accused of his being segregated from\nthe general prison population for his own protection, resulting in his\nundergoing a daily institutional regime with little or no access to exercise or\nto vocational and educational programs’.”[37]In arriving at the sentences which I consider appropriate in this\ncase, I take into account the efforts the accused has made to rehabilitate\nhimself and I am satisfied that he will continue such worthwhile endeavours. In\nthat regard it is the interest of society that custodial persons put in place a\nprogram designed to ensure that the accused does not deviate from his desirable\ngoal of successful rehabilitation. The accused has satisfied me that he is\nremorseful for his criminal acts against the three victims. The accused’s\nbehaviour since the commission of the crimes indicates that he is not likely to\nreoffend. The first offence was committed by the accused approximately 31 years\nago and the last occurred 21 years ago. The accused does not have a criminal\nrecord and his plea of guilty spared his victims the trauma of having to\ntestify once again at trial.[38]For the reasons given, the following sentences are imposed(1) In respect of Count No. 2 - imprisonment for a period of\nsix months;(2) In respect of Count No. 3 - imprisonment for a period of\none month to be served consecutive to the term of imprisonment imposed on Count\nNo. 2; and(3) In respect of Count No. 5 - imprisonment for a period of\ntwo years to be served consecutive to the terms of imprisonment imposed on\nCounts No. 2 and 3.[39]In the aggregate the accused will serve a total of 31 months imprisonment\nfor his crimes against the three complainants.[40]It is my view that the custodial authorities should make\narrangements to transfer the accused from Her Majesty’s Penitentiary in St. John’s or any custodial facility in which the accused is incarcerated to a custodial\nfacility in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, as a matter of urgency. I am\nalso of the view that custodial authorities at all levels, including the\nNational Parole Board,should take into account the rehabilitation programs in\nwhich the accused is presently engaged in Yellowknife and ensure that necessary\narrangements, within the law, are made to have the accused continue to fully\nparticipate in such programs. It is my view, as well, that should the\nappropriate correctional authorities conclude it is in the best interests of\nthe accused and necessary for his continuing rehabilitation that he attend\nHomewood Institution in Guelph, Ontario, that with the consent of the accused,\narrangements be made at the appropriate time, as determined by the correctional\nauthorities, to have the accused attend at such institution. I direct that a\ncopy of my decision and a transcript of the accused’s evidence be sent to the\nappropriate correctional authorities. Accused sentenced."}

Campbell:Ruling on Bail\nRevocation MotionOverview[1]The jury recently returned its verdict in this\ncase, finding the accused, Winston Ellis, guilty on all three counts of the\nindictment against him.More particularly, the jury found the accused\nguilty of the following: (1) the possession of a .25 calibre semi-automatic\nfirearm, without being the holder of a licence under which he may lawfully possess\nit, contrary to s. 91(1) of the Criminal Code; (2) being the occupant of\na motor vehicle in which he knew that there was a firearm, and for which no\noccupant of the vehicle was the holder of a permit under which he may lawfully possess\nthe firearm in the vehicle, contrary to s. 94(1) of the Criminal Code;\nand (3) the possession a loaded prohibited firearm while not the holder of an\nauthorization, licence or registration certificate under which he may lawfully\npossess the firearm, contrary to s. 95(1) of the Criminal Code.[2]All of these offences flowed from the events\nthat took place in Toronto in the early morning hours of May 24, 2010.Essentially, after drawing the attention of the police to his vehicle by racing\nwith another vehicle, the accused tried to evade investigation and arrest by\nquickly driving through a residential neighbourhood and then abandoning his\nvehicle in a stranger’s driveway.Eventually, after the accused was\narrested, his vehicle was searched and the police found a .25 calibre\nsemi-automatic firearm inside the vehicle.The firearm was fully loaded\nwith the six bullet magazine in the handle and another bullet in the firing\nchamber.[3]The firearm uncovered by the police was stored\nneatly inside a hollow space beneath the faux wood panel that surrounded the\nmanual gear shift lever between the front seats.The firearm had clearly\nbeen stored in this hidden location by the accused, who was the only driver of\nthe vehicle.No one unfamiliar with the fittings of the vehicle could realistically\nhave been aware of this compartment.While hidden in this unusual\nlocation, the firearm was stored in such a way that made it easily and quickly accessible\nto the accused from the driver’s seat of the vehicle.[4]Prior to the guilty verdicts by the jury, the accused\nhad been at large on a judicial interim release order for some time and had\nbeen abiding by the terms of that order.The Crown now seeks the\nrevocation of that order, arguing that the accused should be detained in\ncustody pending the imposition of sentence.According to s. 523(1) of the\nCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, chap. C-46, the current recognizance concerning\nthe accused continues in force, subject to its terms, until the imposition of\nsentence, unless, at the time the accused is determined to be guilty, the court\n“orders that the accused be taken into custody pending such\nsentence.”Immediately after the jury’s verdict, the Crown sought\nto “show cause” why an order should be made detaining the accused\nin custody until he is sentenced, and a short hearing was thereafter conducted.The Statutory Grounds for Detention[5]In order to determine this question, I am\nobliged to consider whether the Crown has met its legal burden of showing cause\nthat the accused should be detained according to the governing statutory\ncriteria outlined in s. 515(10) of the Code.This section provides:For\nthe purposes of this section, the detention of an accused in custody is\njustified only on one or more of the following grounds:(a)where the detention is necessary to ensure his\nor her attendance in court in order to be dealt with according to law;(b)where the detention is necessary for the\nprotection or safety of the public, including any victim of or witness to the\noffence, or any person under the age of 18 years, having regard to all the\ncircumstances including any substantial likelihood that the accused will, if\nreleased from custody, commit a criminal offence or interfere with the\nadministration of justice; and(c)if the detention is necessary to maintain\nconfidence in the administration of justice, having regard to all the\ncircumstances, including;(i)the apparent strength of the prosecution’s\ncase,(ii)the gravity of the offence,(iii)the circumstances surrounding the commission of\nthe offence, including whether a firearm was used, and(iv)the fact that the accused is liable, on\nconviction, for a potentially lengthy term of imprisonment or, in the case of\nan offence that involves, or whose subject-matter is, a firearm, a minimum\npunishment of imprisonment for a term of three years or more.The Positions of\nthe Parties[6]The Crown contends that all three grounds\nin s. 515(10) justify the immediate detention of the accused.In this\nregard, the Crown relies upon the details of the criminal record possessed by\nthe accused, the gravity of the firearms offences committed by the accused, the\nreality that these are not the first firearms offences committed by the\naccused, the mandatory minimum term of imprisonment to which the accused is now\nsubject, and the fact that the accused still has other outstanding charges and\narrest warrants.[7]Mr. Adler, on behalf of the accused, argues that\nthe detention of Mr. Ellis is not justified on any of these\ngrounds and that, accordingly, his current judicial interim release order\nshould continue in effect.Defence counsel contends that while the\naccused no longer enjoys the presumption of innocence in connection with these\noffences, his conviction for these firearms offences should not result in his\nautomatic detention pending sentence.Mr. Adler contends that his client\nhas demonstrated his ability to attend court whenever required, has significant\nfamily roots in the community, poses no present danger to the public, and\nshould remain at large until the imposition of sentence.The Background of the Accused/Offender[8]The accused is now 32 years of age.He\nlives in Toronto with his wife and three children.There is no evidence as\nto the nature, if any, of his employment.[9]The accused has a criminal record.More\nspecifically, over a decade ago, in November of 2002, Mr. Ellis was convicted\nof the following crimes: (1) possession of a loaded prohibited firearm; (2)\npossession of a firearm knowing it’s serial number had been defaced; (3)\npossession of a weapon (a firearm) for a purpose dangerous to the public peace;\n(4) possession of cocaine; and (5) failing to attend court.After serving\napproximately seven-and-a-half months in pretrial custody, the accused was sentenced\nto a global term of five months imprisonment and a three year term of probation\nfor these offences.An order was also made prohibiting him from the\npossession of any firearm, cross-bow, restricted weapon, ammunition and\nexplosive substance for life.[10]The accused also has unexecuted, outstanding warrants for his arrest,\nfrom the Windsor area, in relation to drug offences allegedly committed in March\nof 2004, and for allegedly failing to attend court in March of 2005.[11]The Crown also led some evidence on the show cause hearing that\nsuggested that the accused might have had previous gang affiliations and had\nbeen stopped and investigated by the police on a number of other occasions.Only one of these other investigations resulted in criminal charges against the\naccused, in relation to an alleged incident of violence and gunfire in\nSeptember of 2004.However, this matter was ultimately resolved by Mr.\nEllis entering into a peace bond.In my view, this evidence, which appears\nto have been led to cast an adverse light on the general character of the\naccused and the quality of the company he occasionally keeps, is entitled to\nlittle, if any, weight.Analysis1.Introduction[12]Having carefully considered the submissions of the parties, I am\ndriven to the conclusion that the Crown has, indeed, shown cause why the\naccused should be detained in custody pending the imposition of sentence.More particularly, I am satisfied that the detention of the accused pending\nsentence is required by the “tertiary” ground outlined in s.\n515(10)(c) of the Code, as the immediate detention of the accused is\nnecessary in order to maintain confidence in the administration of justice,\nhaving regard to the following considerations.2.The Guilty Verdict of the Jury[13]It is no longer necessary to address the likelihood of conviction or\ntry to accurately assess the “apparent strength of the\nprosecution’s case” against the accused under s. 515(10)(c)(i) of\nthe Code.The trial proceedings are over and the accused has already\nbeen found guilty of the alleged firearms offences by the jury.As a\nresult of the unanimous verdict of the jury, the accused is no longer presumed\ninnocent.Instead, there is simply an enforceable finding of guilt.As the Court of Appeal for Ontario observed in R. v. Farinacci (1993),\n1993 CanLII 3385 (ON CA), 86 C.C.C. (3d) 32, at p. 37:…\nthe presumption of innocence is spent by the verdict, be it a conviction or an\nacquittal.A conviction does not create a presumption of guilt.It\nconstitutes a legal, conclusive finding of guilt.Like an acquittal, it\nis enforceable unless and until reversed.After a conviction, there is no\npresumption left, one way or the other.There is an enforceable finding\nof guilt.3.The Gravity of the Firearms\nOffences Generally[14]While the offences committed by the accused did not involve any\nactual violence against others, these firearms offences are, nevertheless, very\nserious crimes.The sheer gravity of these crimes is properly considered\nunder s. 515(10)(c)(ii) of the Criminal Code.[15]There is no gainsaying the current reality that the possession of illegal\nfirearms is one of the most serious problems facing large urban centers in\nOntario and elsewhere.Such firearms have unfortunately produced a host\nof tragic results in and around Toronto in particular.The human cost of\nsuch offences is often immeasurable.Well-informed, fair-minded, reasonable\nmembers of our community can only be increasingly concerned about the ongoing\ncommission of such offences, and must have their rapt attention focused on the\ntreatment of such offenders by the courts.Their confidence in the\nadministration of justice must be maintained.See: R. v. Danvers\n(2005), 2005 CanLII 30044 (ON CA), 199 C.C.C. (3d) 490 (Ont.C.A.) at para. 77; R. v. Whervin,\n[2006] O.J. No. 443 (S.C.J.) at para. 14; R. v. David, [2006] O.J. No.\n3833 (S.C.J.).[16]This\nis not meant to suggest that the courts should pander to public opinion.Indeed,\nin his text, The Law of Bail in Canada (3rd ed., Loose-leaf), Mr.\nJustice Trotter and the authorities he helpfully discusses, at § 3.4(b), observe that courts must not “react\nto public clamour or hysteria” or the “visceral and negative reaction\nto crime and criminals” that is sometimes displayed.The courts\nmust, rather, serve as a model of “serene, impartial and exemplary\njustice.”See also: R. v. Lamonte (1990), 1990 CanLII 3479 (QC CA), 58 C.C.C. (3d) 530\n(Que.C.A.) at p. 542.Accordingly, when considering the need to “maintain\nconfidence in the administration of justice,” as obliged by s. 515(10)(c)\nof the Code, courts must concentrate on how the administration of\njustice would be perceived by a reasonable, fair-minded and well-informed member\nof the public, who is fully knowledgeable about the facts of the case and the\napplicable legal and constitutional principles.See also: R. v. Hall,\n2002 SCC 64 (CanLII), [2002] 3 S.C.R. 309, at para. 41; R. v. Valente, 1985 CanLII 25 (SCC), [1985] 2 S.C.R. 673, at\np. 689; R. v. MacDougal (1999), 1999 BCCA 509 (CanLII), 138 C.C.C.

(3d) 269 (B.C.C.A.) at para. 18; R. v. D.(R.)\n(2010), 2010 ONCA 899 (CanLII), 106 O.R. (3d) 755 (C.A.) at para. 55; R. v. Gale, 2011 ONCA 144 (CanLII), [2011] O.J.\nNo. 6410 (C.A.) at para. 25.4.The Particular Circumstances of These Offences[17]In the present case, the accused took the necessary steps to store a\nfully loaded semi-automatic handgun in a secret compartment inside his motor\nvehicle.There is no evidence as to why he elected to so arm himself.There was certainly no lawful justification or laudable purpose that would have\npermitted him to do so.[18]Moreover, the particular manner in which this loaded firearm was\nstored reveals that the accused wanted to ensure that this firearm was always\nat the ready, and could be quickly and easily accessed in its hidden\ncompartment whenever circumstances requiring the use of the firearm might present\nthemselves.[19]The secret storage of a loaded firearm, in a motor vehicle being\ndriven by the accused on the city streets of Toronto, created a very real and significant\nrisk to public safety.While the evidence did not disclose that the\naccused ever actually “used” the firearm, there is no denying that\nit was always ready to be used.These circumstances of the crimes\ncommitted by the accused must be taken into account pursuant to s.\n515(10)(c)(iii) of the Criminal Code.5.Mandatory Minimum Term of Imprisonment[20]According to s. 515(10)(c)(iv) of the Code, the court must\ntake into account whether the accused is liable, on conviction, to a\n“potentially lengthy term of imprisonment” or, in the case of a\nfirearms offence, “a minimum punishment of imprisonment” for three\nyears or more.[21]The parties do not agree as to the potential sentence the accused now\nfaces as a result of his conviction for these crimes.The Crown contends\nthat, as this is the “second” series of firearms offences committed\nby the accused, and because the accused has been duly served with notice that\nan increased punishment would be sought, the accused is liable to be sentenced\nto at least the mandatory statutory minimum sentence of five years\nimprisonment, as required by s. 95(2)(ii) of the Criminal Code.On\nthe other hand, the accused contends that, as a result of the lengthy period of\ntime that has passed between the first and the second series of firearms\noffences committed by the accused, the applicable statutory mandatory minimum\nsentence is only three years imprisonment.[22]In addition, the accused has indicated that he proposes to challenge\nthe constitutional validity of this statutory three year mandatory minimum\nperiod of imprisonment.See, for example: R. v. Charles (2010),\n2010 ONSC 5437 (CanLII), 262 C.C.C. (3d) 120 (Ont.S.C.J.); R. v. Elliston, 2010 ONSC 6492 (CanLII); R.\nv. Nur (2011), 2011 ONSC 4874 (CanLII), 275 C.C.C. (3d) 330 (Ont.S.C.J.); R. v. Smickle (2012),\n2012 ONSC 602 (CanLII), 280 C.C.C. (3d) 365 (Ont.S.C.J.).[23]The resolution of those controversial issues will have to await the\nsentencing proceedings in this case.However, at this point in time, and\nwithout pre-judging any of these or any other potential sentencing issues in\nthis case, it is accurate to observe that the accused currently faces “a\nminimum punishment of imprisonment” for a term of three years or more.6.Repeat Offender – Violated\nProhibition Order[24]Significantly, the accused has previous convictions for similar\nfirearms offences, has already served a significant jail term in relation to\nthose offences, and has been prohibited – for life – from ever\npossessing such a firearm again.In short, the particular circumstances\nof these offences display that the accused, now a repeat offender, committed\nserious firearms offences while prohibited from doing so.According to\nthe opening language of s. 515(10)(c) of the Code, the court must have\nregard not only to the specifically enumerated statutory factors, but to\n“all the circumstances” of the case.See: R. v. D.(R.),\nat para. 54; R. v. Andersen, 2012 ONSC 6358 (CanLII), at para. 29.The\npersonal antecedents of the offender are certainly one of the circumstances of\nthis case that must be considered.7.Conclusion[25]In summary, I am satisfied that, having regard to all of these\nvarious circumstances, against the entire factual backdrop of this case, the\nimmediate detention of the accused prior to the imposition of sentence is\nnecessary to maintain public confidence in the administration of justice.In my view, fair-minded, reasonable members of the community, fully informed of\nall of the relevant circumstances of this case and the applicable legal and\nconstitutional principles, and thinking about the issues rationally and\ndispassionately, would seriously question the due administration of our\njudicial interim release system if the accused were permitted to remain at\nlarge in the community pending the imposition of sentence.As McLachlin\nC.J.C. stated in R. v. Hall, at para. 27, “[p]ublic confidence is\nessential to the proper functioning of the bail system and the justice system\nas a whole.”See also: R. v. Mordue.[26]I appreciate that the governing judicial authorities suggest that,\nat least in the pre-trial context where an accused fully enjoys the presumption\nof innocence, the detention of an accused based upon the “tertiary\nground” in s. 515(10)(c) of the Code should be “used\nsparingly” and be a “relatively rare” occurrence.See,\nfor example: R. v. B.(A.) (2006), 2006 CanLII 2765 (ON SC), 204 C.C.C. (3d) 490 (Ont.S.C.J.); R.\nv. LaFramboise (2005), 2005 CanLII 63758 (ON CA), 203 C.C.C. (3d) 492 (Ont.C.A.); R. v. D.(R.),\nat para. 51-53; R. v. Andersen, at para. 25.In the present case,\nhowever, the accused has been convicted by a jury of his peers and all\nof the statutory considerations outlined in s. 515(10)(c) of the Code\nare clearly evident.When these statutory considerations are properly and\nfairly assessed in light of all of the various factual circumstances of this\ncase, this case requires the immediate detention of the accused pending the\nimposition of sentence in order to properly maintain confidence in the\nadministration of criminal justice.See: R. v. Mordue; R. v.\nS.(B.) (2007), 2007 ONCA 560 (CanLII), 255 C.C.C. (3d) 571 (Ont.C.A.).[27]In light of this conclusion, it is unnecessary\nto consider whether or not the Crown has also shown cause justifying the\ndetention of the accused under any of the other statutory grounds for detention\noutlined in s. 515(10) of the Code.Conclusion[28]In the result, given that the Crown has met its burden and has shown\ncause justifying the immediate detention of the accused, I order, pursuant to\ns. 523(1)(b)(ii) of the Criminal Code, that the current judicial interim\nrelease order be vacated and, in its place, shall issue an order detaining the\naccused in custody pending the imposition of sentence.___________________________Kenneth L.

The offender, who was 38 years old at the time,\nsexually abused his seven to nine year old adopted daughter. He did so several\ntimes over a two year period. In consequence, she was emotionally traumatized,\nleft in need of professional help, and sent to live elsewhere.[2]At the sentencing hearing, the\nAttorney General asked for a term of incarceration of nine to eighteen months,\nstressing the gravity of the offence, the sentencing objectives of deterrence\nand denunciation, and the frequency with which such offenders are required to\nserve their sentences in jail rather than in the community. Counsel for the\noffender asked for a conditional sentence to be served in the community,\nemphasizing the man’s personal circumstances, including his remorse, employment\nhistory, emotional stress, and so on. The sentencing judge, moved by the man’s\npersonal circumstances and satisfied a term of incarceration was unnecessary,\nimposed a conditional sentence of twenty three months.[3]The Attorney General then\napplied to this Court, asking for leave to appeal and, if granted, for judgment\nsetting aside the conditional sentence and imposing in its place a term of\nincarceration of at least nine months. In the submission of the Attorney\nGeneral, to whom we granted leave to appeal, the sentencing judge failed: (i)\nto properly consider the sentencing objectives of deterrence and denunciation;\n(ii) to give effect to the gravity of the offence and moral culpability of\nthe offender; and (iii) to heed the principle that like offenders should be\ngiven like sentences.[4]The conditional sentence\nimposed by the sentencing judge rests upon an order he made on the authority of\nsection 742.1 of the Criminal Code. The making of this order constitutes\nthe primary issue—the length of the term is secondary—and the issue is whether\nhe misapplied this section. Whether he did so falls to be determined in light\nof the standard of review adopted in R. v. M.(C.A.), 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] 1\nS.C.R. 500, and of the sentencing provisions of sections 718 to 718.2 of the Code.\nThe import of these provisions was considered at length in R. v. Proulx,\n2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61, so the principles underlying the question are well settled\nand need little elaboration. Such difficulty as these provisions continue to\npose—and this is especially true of section 742.1—has principally to do with\ntheir application.[5]In this instance, Mr. Justice\nSherstobitoff and I are convinced the sentencing judge misapplied section\n742.1. The section reads thus:742.1 Imposing of conditional sentence—Where\na person is convicted of an offence, except an offence that is punishable by a\nminimum term of imprisonment, andthe court(a) imposes a sentence of\nimprisonment of less than two years, and(b) is satisfied that serving the sentence\nin the community would not endanger the safety of the community and would be\nconsistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out in\nsections 718 to 718.2,the court may, for the purposes of\nsupervising the offender’s behaviour in the community, order that the offender\nserve the sentence in the community, subject to the offender’s complying with\nthe conditions of a conditional sentence order made under 742.3.[6]Before making an order under\nthis section allowing the offender to serve his sentence in the community, the\njudge had to be satisfied, as required by clause (b), that this would not\nendanger the safety of the community. This is a condition precedent to the\nmaking of such an order, not a primary reason for doing so, a distinction that\ntended to be overlooked judging from the reasons for judgment. But that said,\nthe judge was satisfied, and on ample evidence, that the offender posed no\ndanger should he be allowed to serve his sentence in the community. There can\nbe no quarrelling with that assessment.[7]The judge had also to be\nsatisfied, as required by clause (b), that allowing the sentence to be served\nin the community would be consistent with the fundamental purpose and\nprinciples of sentencing as set out in section 718 to 718.2 of the Code.\nIt is these which, in our respectful opinion, the sentencing judge misapplied.[8]Section 718 identifies the\nfundamental purpose of sentencing: To contribute to respect for the law and to\nthe maintenance of a just, peaceful, and safe society by the imposition of\n“just sanctions” having one or more of the following objectives:(a) to denounce lawful conduct;(b) to separate offenders form society,\nwhere necessary;(c) to assist in rehabilitating offenders;(e) to provide reparations for harm done to\nvictims and the community;(f) to promote a sense of responsibility in\noffenders, and acknowledgement of the harm done to victims and society.[9]With an eye to this section and\nthe circumstances of the case, the judge identified the paramount objectives as\ndeterrence and denunciation, saying he was satisfied the offender\nwas not in need of rehabilitation. Having regard for what he had to say of deterrence,\nhowever, it is doubtful he gave it much weight. He seems to have regarded this\nas a rather discredited notion, largely devoid of utility. During argument he\nasked counsel for the Attorney General if the Crown had any statistical\nevidence demonstrating the validity of this notion and, when told deterrence\nseemed intuitively to work, he said: “Well I can tell you it hasn’t worked for\ncenturies because we still have a lot of crime don’t we?”[10]With the greatest of respect,\nsuch personal views of deterrence have no place in sentencing. Indeed, if they\nfind their way into the exercise by judges of their discretionary power to\nallow a sentence to be served in the community, which seems to be the case\nhere, they will vitiate the exercise of that discretionary power. We are not\nhere concerned with specific deterrence, which is irrelevant in the\ncircumstances, but of general deterrence. The concept of general deterrence,\nwhich is aimed at discouraging potential offenders, has been much studied, has\ntended to draw cautious to sceptical academic assessment, and has waxed and\nwaned in the hands of judges. Common sense has sustained the concept, courts\nhave repeatedly invoked it in relation to sex offences, and Parliament has\nendorsed it. Only recently, in the context of adopting the present provisions\nof the Criminal Code regarding sentencing, Parliament expressed its\nconfidence in the concept and its efficacy, requiring judges to have regard for\ndeterrence as a legitimate objective of sentencing. So judges must, as a matter\nof law, accept and give effect to the notion of general deterrence as\nParliament intended: R. v. Johnson(D.K) (1996), 1996 CanLII 3148 (BC CA), 112 C.C.C. (3d)\n225 at 235 (B.C.C.A.).[11]Experience suggests a measure of\ncaution and selectivity and balance in giving effect to the notion,\nparticularly when choosing between a conditional sentence and incarceration, a\npoint made in R. v. Proulx, cited earlier. Experience also\nsuggests that general deterrence and denunciation play a significant role in\nrelation to sex offences, even those placed along the lower end of the scale of\ngravity. The authorities in support of this point are many, especially out of\nthis Court, but it might be well to go further afield to support the point, and\nso we refer to R. v. R.A.R., 2000 SCC 8 (CanLII), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 163; R. v. R.N.S.,\n2000 SCC 7 (CanLII), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 149; and R. v. L.F.W., 2000 SCC 6 (CanLII), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 132.[12]In the first of these cases the\nSupreme Court of Canada set aside a conditional sentence as unfit in a case\ninvolving the sexual assault of a young woman. The assault consisted of the\noffender ordering the young woman to lie down in a stable and then removing her\npanties and inserting his finger in her vagina. In setting aside the sentence\non behalf of the majority of the Court—and restoring a one-year term of\nincarceration—Madam Justice L’Heureux-Dubé relied in significant measure upon\ngeneral deterrence and denunciation, invoking the following notion drawn from R.\nv. Proulx:[114]Where\npunitive objectives such as denunciation and deterrence are particularly\npressing, such as cases in which there are aggravating circumstances,\nincarceration will generally be the preferable sanction. This may be so\nnotwithstanding the fact that restorative goals might be achieved by a\nconditional sentence.[13]The second of these cases\nconcerned the sexual abuse of a girl between the ages of 5 and 8 by her\ngrandfather. He fondled her vagina on numerous occasions and on two or three\noccasions paid her to touch his penis. He was sentenced initially to a\nnine-month term of incarceration, which was converted on appeal to a conditional\nsentence. The Supreme Court of Canada set aside the conditional sentence and\nrestored the term of incarceration for the reason, among others, that the\nconditional sentence did not serve to sufficiently denounce the offence.[14]In the third of these cases the\nSupreme Court of Canada was evenly split on the fitness of a conditional\nsentence pertaining to a sex offence. Half the judges expressed reservations\nbut favoured upholding the sentence on application of the standard of review.\nThe other half favoured setting it aside notwithstanding the constraints of the\nstandard of review. The case involved several incidents of forced masturbation\nand fellatio of a boy of 12 who suffered emotional trauma in consequence. Madam\nJustice L’Heureux-Dubé, who spoke for those who would have set aside the\nconditional sentence, held it to be unfit on the footings it did not answer\nadequately to the objectives of denunciation and deterrence, nor give adequate\neffect to the fundamental principle of sentencing.[15]The point of the reference to\nthese cases is that the sentencing judge in the present case was bound, when\ndetermining whether a conditional sentence would be consistent with the\nfundamental purpose of sentencing as required by section 742.1, to have regard\nfor the objectives of both general deterrence and denunciation, and bound to\naccord sufficient weight to each. Considered in light of the circumstances of\nthe case, and in conjunction with the fundamental and other principles of\nsentencing, we are satisfied he failed to do so. He expressly made too light of\ngeneral deterrence, and impliedly attached too little weight to denunciation.[16]This was an incidental failing,\nin the sense it followed upon the sentencingjudge’s misapprehension of the\ncase relative to section 742.1(b) and its requirementthat a conditional\nsentence be consistent with the fundamental principle of sentencing. It is\nhere, particularly, where Mr. Justice Sherstobitoff and I locate the error of\nthe judge and find the unfitness of the sentence. The fundamental principle of\nsentencing is this:718.1 A sentence must be proportionate to\nthe gravity of the offence and the degree ofresponsibility of the offender.This has two elements to\nit: The gravity of the offence and the moral blameworthiness of the offender.\nBoth may be seen to work against the imposition of a conditional sentence in\nthis case.[17]Let us first consider the\ngravity of the offence. By any standard, what this man did to this child\nconstitutes a grave crime. The Criminal Code calls it “sexual\ninterference”, according to section 151, which is defined as touching the body\nof a person under the age of fourteen years for a sexual purpose. Obviously,\nthis encompasses a wide range of conduct. Depending on the particular conduct,\nthe offence is treated as either a summary conviction or an indictable offence.\nIn this instance it was treated as an indictable offence. As such, it was\npotentially punishable by a ten year term of imprisonment. This says something\nof Parliament’s view of the gravity of the offence in the abstract, especially\nwhen the underlying conduct merits treatment as an indictable offence,\nsuggesting Parliament then views the offence asparticularly grave. Indeed,\nParliament is of the view this offence is as grave as sexual assault, a section\n271 offence. As with sexual interference, sexual assault is either a summary\nconviction or indictable offence and carries the same potential punishments.[18]Beyond the abstract lies the\nconcrete. This child was six or seven—it is not entirely clear which—when her\nfather began engaging her sexually. He did so in substitution, it seems, for a\nchronic lack of marital intimacy and sex. In a sensitively conducted interview\nby a female member of the R.C.M.P., the child painfully and haltingly recounted\nher sexual experience with her father, recalling how it started, progressed,\nand finally ended.[19]One evening, after she had\nclimbed up onto his lap and kissed him, he asked her if she would like to know\nabout “French kissing.” Being a curious and trusting six or seven year old, she\nsaid “Okay” and, with that, he inserted his tongue into her mouth and kept it\nthere for a while. Not long afterwards, as he was reading to her at bedtime and\nshe was hugging him, he rolled her onto his stomach and, with his hands on her\nhips, moved her groin area up and down on his “to make him feel good” as she\nremembered, remembering as well that he was then “hard.” She was in her pajamas\nand he was clothed. Sometime later, this same thing occurred.[20]On another occasion he came into\nher bedroom wearing only a bathrobe, lay down beside her, placed her on top of\nhim, opened his robe, and had her move up and down on his erect penis. She\nlater recalled that this was the first time she had seen his penis. As before,\nshe was dressed in her night clothes when this occurred, but this time he was\nfrontally naked.[21]On still other occasions—at\nleast two of them—he slipped into her bedroom late at night, took her hand, and\n“slapped” it around on his penis. He apparently ejaculated on these occasions,\nfor after he had finished and gone to sleep, she got up, went to the bathroom,\nand washed the “wet” from her hands.[22]These things happened over a\nperiod of about two years. They then came to a head with another incident, one\nthat served to bring to a close a course of conduct which, according to the\npre-sentence report, had an element of grooming to it, as though he was\nsystematically readying her for more. On this occasion, she was ill and lying\nin her room when he came in and lay beside her. In time he slipped his hand\nunderneath her pajamas, worked his finger into her vagina, and moved his finger\naround, asking her if it hurt. She told him it did not and he continued for\nabout five minutes to move his finger around inside of her. In admitting to\nthis later, he recalled fearing he had gone too far, for she had become rigid.\nThis prompted him to never again engage her sexually.[23]She lived with her “secret” for\nthe next five or six years, during which she became increasingly rebellious and\nresistant to authority. She took to smoking, hanging out, partying, and getting\ninto trouble at school. One evening, as her father placed his hand on her\nduring a prayer session, she broke down emotionally and soon afterwards\ndisclosed what had happened. Her father and mother, assisted by some good\nSamaritans, thought it best to hush up the matter and send the girl away. She\nwas sent from her home in Saskatoon to an uncle in Edmonton.She was deeply\ndisappointed, sad, and homesick, and was experiencing nightmares and feelings\nof distrust. She was searching, as she expressed it, “to find a safe place in\nmy mind where I can find some peace.” So she was introduced to a clinical\npsychologist and undertook a course of therapy.[24]She later moved back to\nSaskatoon, left school, and moved in with her boyfriend at age sixteen. She\nremains somewhat troubled by the experience with her father, though she\nprofited from the psychological counselling she received, and shehas been\ntrying of late to rebuild her relationship with her family, including her\nfather.[25]Such is the gravity of the\noffence as committed in this instance. We cannot gloss over it in the context\nof considering whether an order allowing the offender to serve a sentence of\nimprisonment in the community would be consistent with this limb of the fundamental\nprinciple of sentencing. Nor can we gloss over it in turning to the other\nlimb—the degree of responsibility of the offender.[26]This speaks to moral\nblameworthiness. What can one say of the extent of the moral blameworthiness of\na thirty-eight year old man who, in a fatherly position of nurture, would do\nsomething such as this to an uncomprehending little person filled with\naffection and trust for him? It is not as though his faculties were somehow\nimpaired. He was neither intellectually deficient, nor uneducated, nor even\nbefuddled by alcohol or drugs. He was clear-minded, knew what he was doing,\nknew it was wrong, and knew he was taking a risk. Perhaps the only thing he did\nnot appreciate was the extent of the lasting harm he was visiting on this\nlittle girl.[27]Not long ago this Court heard a\nsimilar case: R. v. D.L.M. (2001), 2001 SKCA 39 (CanLII), 207 Sask. R. 228 (Sask. C.A.).\nThere the offender had engaged in a progressive series of sexual acts with his\nten year old daughter over a period of two to four months. The acts ranged from\nrubbing his penis against her to repeated cunnilingus. He was given a\nconditional sentence. In a unanimous decision, the Court set the sentence aside\nas unfit and imposed another in its place, namely a term of incarceration of\ntwo and half years. Speaking for the Court in explanation of why we had done\nthis, I commented upon our view of the gravity of the offence and the moral\nblameworthiness of the offender, saying:[16]Whatever may be said of the\ngravity of this offence in the abstract, its commission on this occasion\nconstituted a grave crime. This man’s conduct was highly repulsive. Rather than\nprotect and nurture the life of his little girl, he preyed upon her sexually,debasing her, driving her into a foster home, and leaving her emotionally\nscarred. She was only 10, a child of tender years who implicitly trusted her\nfather, only to havethat trust breached in this vile way and to this\ndevastating effect.The true character of what he did cannot be glossed over.And his gross breach of trust speaks decisively to his degree of\nresponsibility.[28]We went on in that case to\nstress the need for judges, when choosing between a conditional sentence and\nincarceration, to have careful regard for the fundamental principle of\nsentencing. Without suggesting a conditional sentence is never available in\nrelation to an offence of this nature, we observed that such a sentence was inappropriate\nin the circumstances of the case, given fundamental principles of sentencing,\ntogether with the other principles and the objectives of general deterrence and\ndenunciation.[29]In yet another of these cases, R. v. E.S. (2002),\n2001 SKCA 38 (CanLII), 213 Sask. R. 312, this Court took the same view of a conditional sentence.\nThis, too, was a case of sexual interference, or touching of a child, contrary\nto section 151 of the Criminal Code. The incidents were far more\nnumerous than in other cases, and of a more depraved quality, but still what\nthe Court had to say is apposite. Speaking for a unanimous Court, Mr. Justice\nSherstobitoff said this:[5]The gravity of this offence is\nself evident. It is difficult to imagine anything more harmful to a child than\nabuse of this nature from a person in such a position of trust.Where the\nchild should have received love and nurture, she received abuse for the self\ngratification of another..... . .[7]Although the charge is sexual\ntouching, rather than sexual assault, the conduct is, given the age of the\nchild [a youngster],just as serious as sexual assault. And thisCourt has\nrepeatedly imposed sentences of three years imprisonment for serious sexual\nassault.These references to the\nequivalent seriousness of sexual assault and to the repeated imposition of\nsentences in the range of three years merits note. That this Court has\nrepeatedly imposed such sentences, even for single acts of non-consensual\nintercourse between drunken adults, is borne out by the following line of\ncases: R. v. Bird (1992), 1992 CanLII 8307 (SK CA), 105 Sask R. 161; R. v. Cappo\n(1993), 116 Sask. R. 15; R. v. Jackson, 1993 CanLII 4414 (SK CA), [1994] 3 W.W.R. 125; R.\nv. Roberts (1995), 1995 CanLII 3924 (SK CA), 128 Sask. R. 158; R. v. Van de Wiele,\n1997 CanLII 9695 (SK CA), [1997] 3 W.W.R. 477; R. v. D.W.C. (1997), 1997 CanLII 9728 (SK CA), 152 Sask. R. 224; and R.\nCreber (1998), 1997 CanLII 9788 (SK CA), 158 Sask. R. 265.[30]There are many other reported\ndecisions of this Court, including manyinvolving sex offences against\nchildren. Collectively they demonstrate this Court’s view of what amounts to a\nfit or an unfit sentence, depending on the circumstances. In general, what\nthese other decisions demonstrate is this: In instances such as the one now\nbefore us, neither a suspended sentence nor a conditional sentence is fit. The\nfollowing cases serve to make the point: R. v. V.M.W. (1989), 1989 CanLII 4764 (SK CA), 76\nSask. R. 299; R. v. A.S.U. (1990), 1990 CanLII 7667 (SK CA), 86 Sask. R. 191; R. v. S.M.W.\n(1997), 1997 CanLII 9774 (SK CA), 158 Sask. R. 205; R. v. Creber, supra; R. v. D.L.M.\n(2001), 2001 SKCA 39 (CanLII), 207 Sask. R. 228; and R. v. E.S., supra. The\ncircumstances varied from case to case, of course, so the sentences imposed by\nthe Court ranged through nine months, to one or two years, to three years. But\nin none was a suspended or conditional sentence found to be fit. These cases\nspan the last decade or more and are generally consistent with the decisions of\nthe Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. R.A.R.; R. v. R.N.S.;\nand R. v. L.F.W., cited earlier.[31]What these cases suggest is the\nmisapplication by the sentencing judge of yetanother principle of\nsentencing, and that is the principle of parity set out in section 718.2(b) of\nthe Criminal Code:718.2 Other principles of sentencing—A court that imposes a sentence shall also\ntake into consideration the following principles:....(b) a sentence should be similar to\nsentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in\nsimilar circumstances.This principle, which has\nbeen in existence for a very long time and has given rise to ranges of\nsentences for offences of one kind or another, was commented upon at length in R.\nv. McGinn (1989), 1989 CanLII 4784 (SK CA), 49 C.C.C. (3d) 137 (Sask C.A.). It was also commented\nupon in R. v. Proulx, cited earlier. Nothing is to be gained by\nfurther comment, and once again what the matter reduces to in this case is the\napplication of the principle to the facts of the case.[32]Mr. Justice Sherstobitoff and I\nare of the respectful view the sentencing judge failed to give effect to this\nprinciple, though we hasten to add he was placed in a difficult position, given\nsome of the past cases that were drawn to his attention, including his own\ndecision and that of this Court in R. v. D.J.J. (1998), 1998 CanLII 12411 (SK CA), 172 Sask\nR. 182 (Sask. C.A.). There the offender was initially assessed as a danger to\nthe community, an assessment that changed on appeal with the introduction of\nfresh evidence. He was also taken on appeal to have limited mental capacity,\nwhich served to reduce his degree of moral culpability. Clearly, that is not\nthe case here, and in that sense the case is distinguishable and represents a\nparticular application of the principle of parity to a particular set of facts\nas found on appeal.[33]The past cases are many and\nthere is nothing to be gained in recalling any more of them. Suffice it to say\nin sum that, for these reasons as a whole, Mr. Justice Sherstobitoff and I have\nbeen persuaded to set aside the conditional sentence imposed by the sentencing\njudge. In our respectful opinion it was imposed in error, and is demonstrably\nunfit in any event, and must be replaced with a sentence of incarceration to\nbetter reflect the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing as required\nby section 724.1(b).[34]This brings us to the secondary\nissue, namely the length of the term of imprisonment that should be imposed.\nWhat we have had to say so far would suggest a period of incarceration near the\ntop end of the range suggested by the Attorney General—something approaching eighteen\nmonths. But there is another principle of sentencing at work here, namely that\nfound in section 718.2(a):(a) a sentence\nshould be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or\nmitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender....[35]We have already mentioned the\naggravating factors, including the offender’s abuse of his child and of his\nposition of trust, but we have not mentioned the mitigating factors, and there\nare some. To begin with, he took responsibility for what he did, admitted to\nthe whole of it, and entered a plea of guilty to the charge. He thus spared his\ndaughter the wrenching experience of having to testify and left it easier for\nforgiveness and reconciliation to set in. And there is no doubting his genuine\nand profound sense of remorse. He has not only expressed it, he has\ndemonstrated it. His was something of a fragile personality to begin—shy and\nunassertive and sensitive—and was made more so by this experience. He became\ndepressed, so much so he needed professional assistance, which he has been\nreceiving. And on top of this, he and his wife separated and he as at risk of\nlosing his job. He is something of a religious man, has gained much insight,\nand is making a brave and commendable effort at regaining his daughter’s\nrespect. She has begun to reciprocate, for she too seems anxious to leave this\nbehind. All in all this has been a tragic family experience, humiliating and\nhurtful for father and daughter alike. And painful for others, too.[36]Reason and compassion alike are\ndrawn to reduction on account of this. Were it not for considerations such as\nthese, a term near the top of the range suggested by the Attorney General would\nbe appropriate. But as it is, we shall temper the term.Having regard for the\nwhole of the matter, including the comparative gravity of the incidents\nunderlying the conviction and the comparative degree of harm suffered by the\ngirl, we have decided that a term at the bottom of the range suggested by the\nAttorney General is appropriate. Accordingly, we impose a period of\nincarceration of nine months.[37]As we have said many times in\nthe past, subjective factors are occasionally overborne by objective\nconsiderations and judges must, however painful, do their duty.Nothing\nshort of a term of incarceration of this duration can adequately serve the ends\nof justice. What remains is for the authorities to administer the sentence as\nthey see fit.JACKSON J.A. (in dissent)[38]M.S. was charged that between\nJanuary 1, 1991 and December 31, 1994 he repeatedly touched R.S., a person\nunder 14, directly with a part of his body, contrary to section 151 of the Criminal\nCode.[1]R.S. is the daughter of M.S.[39]Following receipt of the guilty\nplea and at the sentencing hearing, Crown counsel described the incidents\ngiving rise to the offences in these terms:. . . What we found out from the\nvictim, and this is at -- it started at about age seven, she provided a\nstatement indicating it started at seven, it was in [named town] and basically\nwhat she’s indicating is that she would be in the bedroom in her pyjamas, panties\non, and he would come in and they would -- he would place her on top of him\nwith an erection and he would rub his penis against her vagina.She describes\nit as typical starting slow and then moving faster and faster and then\neventually stopping.She doesn’t indicate as to whether or not there was ever\nany ejaculation, but she describes that as the pattern for the incidents.She\nalso indicates that it was overtop of her underwear, overtop of her panties and\nnot directly on her vagina.She also indicates that on another\noccasion he taught her how to french kiss and that there was -- that took place\nbetween he and -- he and his daughter.He also -- she also indicates on\nanother occasion that he was going into the bathroom area and he undid his robe\nand rubbed his penis against her on that occasion.He had also, she indicates,\non two occasions, came in and took his hand -- her hand, placed it on his penis\nand what she indicates is she made a slappy motion with her hand. This went on\nfor some time and she said that afterwards her hand was wet and that she would\nhave to go and wash it off.Again, she’s not able to indicate whether or not\nthere was ejaculant (sic).She finally indicates that on one\noccasion there was vaginal penetration with the finger.This took place over\nfive minutes and she indicates that at the time she was nine years of age.[2][40]At the sentencing hearing, Crown\ncounsel took the position that a conditional sentence would never be available\nin the circumstances present in this case. This exchange took place between the\nCourt and Crown counsel:THE COURT:Are you saying it’s a\nposition of the Crown that in every case where there’s a father and a child,\nthat there must be incarceration? Is that -- is that your position?MR. KRITZER:In -- on -- for sexual\nassaults?THE COURT:Yes.MR. KRITZER:Yes.THE COURT:Very well.So that’s the\nposition of the Crown, that there ought -MR. KRITZER:Yes.THE COURT:- never to be a conditional\nsentence in these circumstances.MR. KRITZER:Yes.THE COURT:Very well.MR. KRITZER:We’re taking the position\nthat a conditional sentence would be inappropriate in these circumstances in\naccordance with denunciation.That it wouldn’t meet with the societal demand\nfor denunciation in terms of facts of this incident.You’ve got an incident\nthat’s repeated over -- on a number of occasions over the course of a number of\nyears, involves sexual touching of a significant nature and has had a\nsignificant impact on the victim.In those cases we would submit that the\nrange is nine to 18 months incarceration and that a conditional sentence should\nnot be seen as an option in regards to this sentencing matter.We’re also\nsuggesting two years probation to follow, reporting and assessment counselling\nand treatment for sex offenders as may be directedby the probation officer .\n. . [3][41]For his part and in response to\nthis, respondent’s counsel cited R. v.Proulx[4]\nand its four companion cases including R. v. R.N.S.[5]\nwhere the Supreme Court of Canada did not reject the possibility of a longer\nconditional sentence being an acceptable equivalent to a nine-month sentence of\ncustody for offences similar to those committed here.[42]The learned sentencing judge\nimposed a sentence of 23 months to be served in the community, with a curfew of\n9:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. for nine months, and 100 hours of community service. In\naddition, the Court ordered that M.S. take such sexual offender assessment,\ncounselling and treatment as directed by his conditional sentence supervisor.[6][43]In making this decision, the\nlearned sentencing judge noted that: (i) a conditional sentence is available\nfor any type of offence;(ii) in R. v. D.J.J.[7]\nthis Court imposed a conditional sentence for one count under s. 151 and one\nunder s. 271 where there was little risk of re-offence following a report to\nthat effect; (iii) Dr. Nicholaichuk testified that M.S. was in the lowest\ncategory of offence risk; (iv) M.S.’s wife stated that M.S. had begun to\nreestablish a healthy relationship with his daughter and that her father’s\nincarceration would be detrimental to her; (v) M.S.’s wife stated that her\nhusband’s financial support was “essential” for her and her family to avoid\nhardship; and (vi) while M.S.needs to support his wife and five year old son,\nhe is at an age when re-employment after prison may be problematic. The\nsentencing judge then acknowledged that the offence to which M.S. pleaded\nguilty is “a very serious offence which is compounded by the position of trust\nhe held with regard to the victim.”[8] He\nconcluded with these words:[14]On the other hand, there is a very\nlow likelihood that the accused will re-offend. In the opinion of Dr.\nNicholaichuk he has been rehabilitated. The interference stopped eight years\nago at the first indication of resistance by the victim. He has no prior\ncriminal record. He has a significant record of employment. He provides much\nneeded financial support to the family and if he lost his job it would be\ndifficult for him, at his age, to find other suitable employment.In my view,\nin the proper circumstances a conditional sentence can fulfil the sentencing\nobjectives of general deterrence, specific deterrence and denunciation. When I\nweigh and consider all of the circumstances I conclude that in this case a\nconditional sentence is appropriate.[15]I note that the probation officer\nconcluded that electronic monitoring did not appear to be viable given the\naccused’s circumstances.[9][44]The Crown appeals. Crown counsel\nargues that the sentencing judge placed undue emphasis on jail’s lack of\ndeterrent effect, M.S.’s low risk to re-offend and the family’s needs, and\nfailed to recognize the serious nature of the incidents. As a consequence, it\nis said, the sentencing judge did not give sufficient or any regard for his\nduty in relation to general deterrence, denunciation and retribution. Finally,\nit is submitted that the sentencing judge should not have relied on R. v.\nD.J.J.as that decision concerned the sentencing of a learning disabled\nyouth, but instead he should have considered such cases as R. v. D.L.M.[10]\nand R. v. McKay.[11][45]For his part, respondent’s\ncounsel relies and expands on the submissions that he made to the sentencing\njudge, makes reference to the standard of appellate review and submits an\nadditional letter from the victim wherein she advises this Court that she is\nsatisfied with the sentence her father received. In addition, he takes issue\nwith Crown counsel’s use of, what he argues is, inflammatory language.\nRespondent’s counsel writes in his factum:13.The more serious material errors in\nwhich the Crown goes beyond what the evidence disclosed include:a.The Crown uses inflammatory language\nsuch as: “he digitally penetrated her vagina once for some five minutes . . .\nafter that incident he forced no further sexual contact upon her” [¶ 7 Appellant’s Factum]; “Serial offences such as in\nthe case at bar” [¶ 28\nAppellant’s Factum]; “Forced sexual intercourse is one example. Multiple\ninstances of serious sexual abuse, including the digital violation of one’s\nchild is another”[¶ 37 Appellant’s Factum]; “This was a considered and\ndeliberate crime, done repeatedly and with care by a mature adult male in full\npossession of his faculties.His only explanation is that he wasn’t finding\nsexual satisfaction in his wife.” [¶ 40 Appellant’s Factum]....b....The Appellant’s statement that the\nRespondent would “rub his erect penis against her vagina with clothing in\nbetween” is an error, a matter which was brought to the attention of the prosecutor\nat the time of the sentencing proceeding on October 17, 2002, when if necessary\nfurther evidence would have been led on the point: [Transcript 34:2-8] and\nsubsequently stated by the prosecutor as follows: “she also indicates that it\nwas over top of her underwear, over top of her panties and not directly on her\nvagina.” [Transcript 37:4].In her statement to the police, [R.S.] was asked\nwhat position she was in when she was on top of the Respondent to which she\nsaid: “Well . . . my legs were together though, I was just laying on top of\nhim”: [p. 13 Statement of [R.S] Tab 1].c.¶ 6 Appellant’s Factum -- The Respondent\nadmits to sexual touching as stated, but that does not amount to the same thing\nas teaching the victim “to masturbate him” and there is no evidence of\nmisconduct going that far.The witness statement makes clear that in\nconnection with this type of misconduct the daughter pretended she was sleeping\nand she guessed he thought she was sleeping: [p. 19-21 Statement of [R.S.] Tab\n1];d.¶ 7 Appellant’s Factum -- The Respondent\nnever forced sexual contact upon the victim at any time and in fact stopped\nimmediately when she gave the first sign of resistance.The Crown’s use of the\nterm “penetration” is inflammatory and seriously prejudicial.The ordinary\nmeaning of the term “penetrate” carries an implication of force and is a\ntrigger word for forcible rape or attempted rape....[12][46]Respondent’s counsel offers his\nexplanation of all this from the pre-sentence report and examinations of M.S. I\ndo not take it that he is attempting to minimize the serious nature of the\nincidents. Rather, I interpret his submission on this point to be a recognition\nof the gravity of the offence, while at the same time asking that it not be\noverstated or stated beyond what was presented at the sentencing hearing. His\nsubmission is that the punishment M.S. received should be assessed against the\nwords which were used to sentence him. I agree. The sentencing judge found that\nthere were four to seven incidents which occurred over a period of two years\nwhen the child was aged seven to nine. The sentencing judge did not need to\ncomment further on the nature of the incidents as they were a matter of record\nand agreement.[47]Leaving that aside, and turning\nto the substance of the appeal, I first observe that there have been many\ndecisions written about the impact of the 1995 amendments which brought about\nthe present Part XXIII of the Criminal Code. As this is an oral\njudgment, I do not intend to analyse those decisions here. It is sufficient to\noffer the comment that Part XXIII gives the courts additional guidance and\nresources in terms of sentencing tools and principles so as to permit offenders\nto be sentenced more appropriately. In particular, these tools and principles\nrecognize the place for restorative justice in sentencing. Since the enactment\nof Part XXIII, our task has been to consider past sentencing practices in the\nlight of Parliament’s direction and sentence accordingly.[48]The Crown emphasizes the need to\ndeter offenders, denounce the conduct and provide retribution. While I agree\nwith the need to do so, I do not agree that a custodial sentence is the only\nmeans to effect these results. As has been said many times before by this Court\nand others, incarceration is only one tool available to a judge considering the\nappropriate sentence. Incarceration cannot be the presumptive choice for any\noffence.[49]Notwithstanding what the\nsentencing judge said during the sentencing hearing, he must be taken to have\ngiven effect to deterrence, denunciation and retribution by imposing a\nsignificantly longer sentence than that suggested by the Crown while ordering\nthat it be served in the community. A 23-month conditional sentence which\nincludes a curfew for nine months, 100 community service hours and compelled\ntreatment must be considered as serving the ends of deterrence, denunciation\nand retribution as well as being proportional to the gravity of the offence and\nthe degree of responsibility of the offender. It is surely the functional\nequivalent of a sentence at the low end of the range offered by Crown counsel\nat the sentencing hearing.At the same time, it permits the accused to keep\nhis job, support himself and his family and maintain family relationships.\nGiving greater importance to the punitive aspects of sentencing than this will\nvisit hardship on R.S. and the other members of her family.[50]I find the cases cited by the\nCrown to be distinguishable. The case which comes closest is R. v. D.L.M.,\nbut this describes the nature of the sexual acts and D.L.M.:[5]Mr. M. engaged in a progressive\nseries of sexual acts with his 10 year old daughter over a period of two to\nfour months. He started by licking her vagina, then began rubbing his penis on\nher vagina and having her fondle his penis, and finally took to performing\ncunnilingus on a regular, if not daily, basis, ejaculating on at least one\noccasion.He engaged in these acts while his son was playing outside during\nthe day or sleeping in his room at night. His daughter repeatedly asked him not\nto do these things, but to no avail, until she was removed from the home by\nfamily services.[6]As might be expected, this experience\nhad an emotionally devastating impact upon the child, requiring therapy in an\neffort to restore her sense of self‑esteem, her ability to concentrate on\nher school work, and so on. She is now in foster care.[7]Previous to the commission of this\noffence, Mr. M. had been convicted of others, including theft, obstruction of a\npolice officer, possession of a narcotic, and two assaults. He was said to have\nbeen raised in a loving, caring home by hard working and responsible parents.\nHe was also said to have been free of childhood abuse, with the exception, he\nsuggested, of having been encouraged at the age of six or eight to engage in\nsome sexual acts with his sister's 16 year old girlfriend. He had taken to\nusing drugs and alcohol at an early age and had drifted from one place to\nanother, and one endeavour to another, until he finally settled on the ...\nFirst Nations with his two children.[8]He\nshowed little insight into his offence. He ascribed his actions to the\ninfluence of alcohol and pornography, passed off the harm to the child, and\nviewed himself as a victim. While he was willing to take alcohol, drug, and\nsexual offender treatment, he was said to be insincere in this and was assessed\nat a high risk to re‑offend.[13]Moreover, in D.L.M.\nthis Court imposed a penitentiary sentence which precluded the possibility of a\nconditional sentence. A case like R. v. McKay,[14]\nwhich was an offender’s appeal against a custodial sentence, as opposed to this\nCourt not upholding a conditional sentence, has little precedential value.[51]These are the factors which set\nthis case apart from the cases cited by the Crown:1.the number and age of the incidents:four to seven and having\noccurred more than eight years ago;2.the nature of the charge, which was under s. 151 of the Criminal\nCode (uponM.S. pleading guilty, the Crown stayed a charge of repeated\nacts of sexual assault contrary to s. 271);3.the respondent stopped his offending behaviour on his own\ninitiative;4.the family\nremained together for some seven years after the last incidentwhich\ndemonstrates the lack of risk;5.the respondent has no record;6.the respondenthas otherwise lived a productive life, having\nworked for the same company for some 28 years;7.the respondent is currently the financial mainstay of his\nestranged wife and other child;8.the respondent is\nbeginning to reestablish a healthy relationship with the victimwho wants that\nrelationship;9.the respondent is extremely remorseful and, prior to the\nhearing, had already undergone treatment on his own initiative; and10.an expert called on the respondent’s behalf at the sentencing\nhearing confirmed that he was at virtually no risk to re-offend.Nor do I discount the\nimportance of such factors as the respondent’s guilty plea and complete\ncooperation with the authorities, but I do not mention them further because in\nsome of the cases cited by the Crown these factors were also present.[52]Again, as this is an oral\njudgment, I will not spend a long time on the standard of review which would\npermit intervention. It has been often stated that a court of appeal can\nintervene only in limited circumstances to overturn a sentencing judge's\ndecision. A court of appeal should intervene only if the sentencing judge has\nerred in principle or the sentence is demonstrably unfit.[53]On my review of the sentencing\ntranscript, the various reports, letters and judgment, I neither see an error\nin principle nor agree that this sentence is demonstrably unfit.I would\ndismiss the appeal.[1]R.S.C. 1985, c.

CHARRON J.A. (Dissenting):[6]I disagree with this result.In my view, the sentence wasmanifestly unfit, having regard to the usual range imposed uponlike accused for this type of offence.While a lesser sentencemay be appropriate in circumstances where the chance ofrehabilitation can be convincingly demonstrated, in my view, therecord here does not support such a finding.The sentencingjudge, in his reasons, noted an absence of mitigating factorsother than the fact that the appellant had no record and had asupportive wife and a young family.In my view, these factors donot justify the imposition of a sentence that falls outside thegeneral range.[7]I would allow the appeal and increase the sentence, giventhe findings of the trial judge of some chance at rehabilitation,to 4 years imprisonment.Louise Charron J.A."}

Corby, Esq. for the\nAppellantJames H. Appleton, Esq. for the\nRespondentBY THE COURTLeave to appeal sentence is granted.\nThe appeal is allowed. The conditional discharge is set aside. It is directed\nthat a conviction be entered against Ms. McNamara but that the imposition of\nsentence be suspended for a period of one year. The Probation Order is\nconfirmed.BY THE COURTThe respondent Jean Elizabeth McNamara\npleaded guilty to two counts of theft from her two employers, each exceeding\n$1,000.00, contrary to s.334(a) of the Criminal Code of Canada. In respect of these offences a\nProvincial Court Judge ordered that Ms. McNamara be discharged on the conditions\nprescribed in a Probation Order.The Probation Order was for the term\nof one year. In addition to keeping the peace and being of good behaviour, Ms.\nMcNamara was ordered to perform 100 hours of community service. This service\nwas performed by Ms. McNamara prior to the hearing of this appeal. In addition,\nsubsequent to a civil judgment against her, but prior to the laying of the\ncriminal charges, Ms. McNamara made restitution to her employers of the sum of\n$4,126.01 which included the amount stolen as well as interest and costs.The Crown has appealed the granting\nof the conditional discharge contending that the trial Judge failed to place\nproper emphasis on the general deterrent aspect of sentencing and imposed a\nsentence that was manifestly inadequate having regard to all of the\ncircumstances and the nature of the offence. At trial the Crown, citing\nprevious decisions of this Court, sought the imposition of a custodial sentence\nin the range of 30 days. In any event, it is our opinion that this is a proper\ncase for the granting of leave to appeal.As we have said on previous\noccasions, the public interest requires that it be made very clear to one and\nall that in the absence of special circumstances a person holding a position of\ntrust who steals from his or her employer must expect a term of imprisonment.\nThe trial Judge in the instant case purported to find special circumstances in\nthis case in the[Page 2]age of Ms. McNamara (she is 24) and\nthe assertion that she did not hold a \"complete position of trust\"\nwith her employers. In our opinion, these are not the special circumstances\ncontemplated by the jurisprudence.The fact of the matter was that Ms.\nMcNamara was employed as a bookkeeper/secretary for two corporations. Her\nresponsibilities included writing cheques, keeping ledgers and making bank\ndeposits. During her term of employment of just over one year, she used her\nposition of trust to steal various amounts of money from the two corporations\nby three different methods and to manipulate the accounting process in order to\navoid detection. It was determined, for example, that on ten occasions she\naltered her own pay cheque after it had been signed to give herself a higher\namount. On six other occasions, she made payments to fictitious suppliers when,\nin fact, the money went to her. When the thefts were detected, Ms. McNamara's\nonly explanation was that she had used the stolen funds to cover credit card\ndebts that she had incurred.We are of the opinion that the\nconditional discharge, together with community service work that was ordered by\nthe trial judge, was not an adequate punishment in the circumstances of the\npresent case. However, because Ms. McNamara is a young first offender who has\nmade full restitution and has a very favourable pre-sentence report, we are of\nthe opinion she is entitled to some leniency. While a term of imprisonment of\nthirty days as requested by the Crown might have been appropriate in the\ncircumstances, in view of the fact that Ms. McNamara has already performed 100\nhours of community service, we allow the appeal, set aside the conditional\ndischarge, direct that a conviction be entered against her and[Page 3]suspend the imposition of sentence for a period of one\nyear. We confirm the Probation Order."}

Christie, forthe Defence)Defendant))))HEARD:July 7, 2017REASONS FOR SENTENCEM. J. Donohue, J.Overview[1]Mr. D’Souza stands to be sentenced after\nconviction on one count of possession of heroin, and one count of possession of\nheroin for the purpose of trafficking.Mr. D’Souza was acquitted on a charge\nof trafficking.The total amount seized from his auto body shop was 34.2 grams\nof heroin.Circumstances of the Offence[2]On July 17, 2013, Mr. D’Souza and his auto body\nshop were under surveillance by police in the street crime and drug unit.He\nwas observed to come out of his body shop and get into a parked car on the\npassenger side to converse with the driver.The driver, Mr. Samra, testified\nthat Mr. D’Souza sold him heroin in a manila envelope.Police followed Mr.\nSamra and arrested him.Sometime later Mr. Samra told police that he was sold\nthe heroin by Mr. D’Souza.[3]In search of the body shop conducted under\nwarrant on the evening of July 17, 2013 the police found a package of heroin\nwith dime baggies in the cabinet above the main desk in the office.[4]A 32-gram bag of heroin was located in the\npocket of a sweater hanging in the office alcove.Other indicia of trafficking\nwere found, including a debt book on the desk, dime baggies in the desk drawer\nand $900 in cash which Mr. D’Souza had on his person that evening upon his\narrest.[5]It was admitted in the trial that the total\nof 34.2 grams had a street value of $8,208 if sold at the gram level.[6]Mr. D’Souza explained that the sweater\nbelonged to his employee Andres and he denied ownership of, or knowledge about,\nthe drugs either in the sweater or the desk cabinet. He confirmed that he met\nwith Mr. Samra in the car outside his body shop but testified that they\ndiscussed doing work on Mr. Samra’s car and they did not transact a sale of\ndrugs.[7]The jury found Mr. D’Souza not guilty of\ntrafficking but guilty of the possession charges.[8]The jury, in convicting on the possession\ncharges must have rejected some of Mr. D’Souza’s explanations. On the basis of\nall the evidence, they must have found that Mr. D’Souza had knowledge and\ncontrol of the drugs located in his office and possessed them.[9]I was satisfied that his knowledge and\ncontrol of the drugs was reasonably inferred from the surrounding circumstances\nof being located in the office he owned and at the desk where he worked.Circumstances of the Offender[10]Mr. D’Souza is age 58 and was born in the\nUSA.He immigrated to Canada 25 years ago to marry his wife.They have three\nadult sons. He was very involved in raising their sons and encouraged sports.[11]Mr. D’Souza graduated from the University\nof Maryland in 1980 from a Criminal justice program.He also got a diploma in\nprivate investigations.He worked for an American airline for a number of\nyears.He was laid off just before the airline went bankrupt.This coincided\nwith his move to Canada.[12]His wife has been the breadwinner of the\nfamily.Initially Mr. D’Souza was not granted a work visa.He was a stay at\nhome dad until their youngest child was school aged. He was not successful in\nhis business ventures.Mr. D’Souza tried a Dive Shop, CFX Auto Collision,\nMiata Used Parts Shop and finally Capital Auto Collision, each of which\nstruggled financially and did not survive.[13]Mr. D’Souza, as confirmed by his wife,\nsister, and doctor, has never used illegal substances.[14]Mr. D’Souza denies responsibility for the\noffences before the Court.He blames his employees.His wife and sister\ndescribe him as naïve and someone that was taken advantage of.His wife said\nhe was a family man who cared deeply about his community. She said he has done\nvolunteer work as well.[15]The probation officer’s assessment was,”\nThe subject minimizes his involvement in the offence and does not appear to\naccept responsibility for his actions.The subject’s approach to such serious\ncharges was very relaxed.The subject’s sister opines that the subject “does\nnot grasp consequences well”, which places him in dangerous situations without\nfully understanding how it will affect his life.”[16]Mr. D’Souza has no criminal record.Impact on the Victim and/or Community[17]The Ontario Court of Appeal, in R. v Sidhu,\n[2009] O.J. No.325 (Ont. C.A.)242 emphasized the danger of heroin and stated,\n“Time and again, this court and the Supreme Court of Canada have made it clear\nthat heroin is the most pernicious of the hard drugs—it is the most addictive,\nthe most destructive and the most dangerous.Heroin trafficking has been\ndescribed as a “despicable” crime and one that “tears at the very fabric of our\nsociety.”Legal Parameters[18]Possession of a heroin is punishable by a\nmaximum of seven years imprisonment.[19]Possession of heroin for the purpose of\ntrafficking has a maximum punishment of life imprisonment.Positions of Crown and Defence[20]The Crown seeks a penitentiary sentence of\nfive years as being the range for this offender in these circumstances. The\nCrown seeks the ancillary DNA orders and weapons prohibition.[21]Defence proposes a sentence of 2 years less\ntwo days as appropriate to meet the appropriate principles of sentencing in\nthis area. The defence submitted that the range for a low level trafficker is 2\nto 4 years.Case Law[22]The Crown relies on the following four\ncases: R. v. Pimentel, [2004] O.J. No. 5780 (Sup. Ct.); R. v.\nVan Nguyen (1997), 31 O.T.C. 132 (Ct. J. (Gen. Div.)); and R. v. Mete,\n[1980] O.J. No. 1438 (S.C. C.A.); R. v. Dhillon, 2017 ONSC 258 (CanLII).[23]In Pimentel the offender was\nsentenced to four years imprisonment for possession of heroin for the purpose\nof trafficking and possession of the proceeds of crime.The heroin had a value\nof $2,300 and the offender had a lengthy criminal record.The court reviewed a\nnumber of cases of similar amounts of heroin which resulted in a range of\ncustodial sentences ranging from 3-7 years in length.[24]At paragraph 14 the court referred to the\ndecision of the Ontario Court of Appeal of R. v. Belanger, [1973] O.J.\nNo. 355 (S.C. C.A.) at para. 2:Heroin is a pernicious and addictive\nnarcotic.Consequently, severe sentences are imposed by the courts to deter\nthose tempted by commercial gain from trafficking in the illicit drug.Heroin is considered a\n‘hard drug’.[25]In Van Nguyen the 28 year old\noffender, who had no criminal record, was sentenced to seven years penitentiary\ntime.The charge was trafficking in 27.95 grams of heroin, sold for $6,000.[26]In Mete the Ontario Court of Appeal reduced\na sentence from twelve years to seven years for an offender guilty of\ntrafficking in heroin of two-thirds of an ounce of heroin for $2,000.The\noffender had been an addict who trafficked to supply his own habit and had an extensive\ncriminal record, including a previous conviction for trafficking in heroin.[27]R v Dhillon, a decision of the Superior Court of Ontario, involved\na 53 year old male with no criminal record convicted of trafficking in heroin\ninvolving ½ a kilogram.The court considered that the global range in those\ncircumstances was six to nine years in jail.He was sentenced to seven years\nin custody less time served.The court noted that this was not a mistake of\nyouth in light of the defendant’s age.[28]The defence relies on the case of R. v.\nAnang, 2016 ONCA 825 (CanLII), 367 C.R.R. (2d) 289, when the Court affirmed the\ntrial judge’s sentence of four years’ imprisonment. The case involved 75 grams\nof heroin with an estimated street value of $18,000. The defence points out\nthat this was twice the amount of drugs located in this case.[29]The defence also relies on the case of R.\nv. Zamani, [1999] O.J. No. 3780 (C.A.). The accused was convicted of\nselling 50 grams of heroin for $5,500. The sentence imposed was 2 years less a\nday. The Court of Appeal noted that the trial judge could have imposed a\nsentence of 3 to 4 years on the facts of the case. The majority of the court\ndeferred to the trial judge’s conclusion that the accused showed a strong\npotential for rehabilitation. They decided that they could not say that an\nimposition of a maximum reformatory term was outside the range.[30]I note that the dissenting Judge, Charron\nJ.A., stated that the mitigating factors of “no criminal record and a\nsupportive wife and family” did not justify the imposition of a sentence\noutside of the general range.Mitigating and Aggravating Factors[31]There are a number of aggravating factors\nin this case.[32]Because Mr. D’Souza is not a user or addict\nof heroin, it follows that he must have been in possession of the drugs for the\npurpose of making a commercial profit. This is also an aggravating factor.[33]There are also several mitigating factors.[34]Mr. D’Souza has no prior criminal record.[35]Mr. D’Souza has been a loving father and\nhusband. He is noted to be an community minded person by family. He does not\nabuse substances.He has good family support and loving relationships.Right of Allocution[36]The accused was advised of his right of\nallocution and he indicated that he did not wish to say anything.Principles of Sentencing[37]The Criminal Code sets out the\npurpose and principles of sentencing as follows:718. The fundamental purpose of sentencing\nis to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the\nlaw and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just\nsanctions that have one or more of the following objectives:(a) to denounce unlawful\nconduct;(b) to deter the offender\nand other persons from committing offences;(c) to separate offenders\nfrom society, where necessary;(d) to assist in\nrehabilitating offenders;(e) to provide\nreparations for harm done to victims or to the community; and(f)\nto promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgment of the\nharm done to victims and to the community.718.1 A\nsentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of\nresponsibility of the offender.718.2\nA\ncourt that imposes a sentence shall also take into consideration the following\nprinciples:(a)a sentence\nshould be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or\nmitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender, and, without\nlimiting the generality of the foregoing,(b)a sentence\nshould be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences\ncommitted in similar circumstances;[38]Section 10(1) of the Controlled\nDrugs and Substances Act provides as follows:(1)\nWithout restricting the generality of the Criminal Code, the fundamental\npurpose of any sentence for an offence under this Part is to contribute to the\nrespect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society\nwhile encouraging rehabilitation, and treatment in appropriate circumstances,\nof offenders and acknowledging the harm done to victims and to the community.[39]None of the aggravating factors set\nout in s. 10(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act apply in this\ncase.[40]Section\n487.051(3) of the Criminal Code allows the court to make a DNA order for\nthe circumstances of this charge on application by the prosecutor, if the court\nis satisfied that such an order is in the best interests of the administration\nof justice. In deciding whether to make the order, the court is required to\nconsider the following: the defendant’s criminal record; the nature of the\noffence; the circumstances surrounding its commission; and the impact such an\norder would have on the defendant’s privacy and security of the person.Reasons[41]The\nmost important sentencing principles in a case such as this are denunciation,\nand deterrence. The sentence must also be proportionate to the gravity of the\noffence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.[42]Counsel\nagreed that Mr. D’Souza was in the category of a “low level trafficker”.[43]On review of the case law relied on by the\ndefence I do not find the circumstances of Mr. D’Souza place him in any\nexceptional category where a sentence in the appropriate range would not be necessary.Mr. D’Souza is not an addict, he is a man of mature years, and the substance\ninvolved was heroin. Further, Mr. D’Souza had education, experience and a level\nof comfort in his living circumstances.He was not a vulnerable person as we\noften see in the court system.[44]The sentence of four years in custody, is\nreasonable in light of the authorities, and takes into consideration Mr. D’Souza’s\npersonal circumstances of being a loving father and community minded member of\nsociety. It is my decision that a sentence of four years in custody is required\nfor the purposes of denunciation in a case such as this.[45]An order for the taking of a D.N.A. sample pursuant\nto 487.051(3) is appropriate in this case.Ancillary Orders[46]A weapons prohibition\norder under s. 109(2)(a)(ii) of the Criminal Code shall issue for a\nperiod of ten years after Mr. D’Souza’s release from custody.[47]A D.N.A. order under s. 487.051(3) of the Criminal\nCode shall issue.Final Decision[48]Mr. D’Souza is sentenced to four years in\ncustody on each count/charge to be served concurrently, less a day for\npre-sentence custody.[49]A D.N.A. order under s. 487.051(3) of the Criminal\nCode shall issue.[50]A weapons prohibition order under s. 109(2)(a)(ii) of the Criminal Code shall issue for\na period of ten years after Mr. D’Souza’s release from custody.___________________________M.

The accused, who was reported to have been at\nthe residence, became the subject of a police search. The police were advised\nby the accused’s wife that he had called and told her that he was at a hotel in\nRegina. At approximately 11:00 a.m. on July 27, 2015, police attended at the\nCoachman Inn, and found the accused naked in a hotel room. When the accused saw\nthe police, he began drinking heavily from a 26 ounce bottle of whiskey. He was\narrested, first acting as if he had passed out, and then making disparaging\ncomments to the police. He was charged with an aggravated assault of the male\nfound at that residence, and acquitted of that charge by a jury on May 18,\n2016.[4]The accused, who\nis 52 years old, was born on the ---- First Nation. He has a lengthy record of\nboth violent and nonviolent offences. Those offences include assault causing\nbodily harm in March 1980, October 1980, June 1982, September 1982, July 1986,\nand May 1989; aggravated assault in November 1987 and October 2002; break and\nenter and aggravated assault in November 1987; armed robbery in April 1992;\nuttering threats and break and enter and commit an indictable offence in August\n2000 and manslaughter in October 2000. The accused also has a lengthy record of\njustice system offences. Those offences include breaches of probation in 1980\nand 1982; obstructing a police officer in 1985 and 1987; failing to appear in\n1982, 1986, 1989, 1992; and disobeying an order of the court and breaching a\nrecognizance in 2000.[5]Further, the\naccused breached the terms of his statutory release in the course of his 10\nyear sentence for manslaughter which was the predicate offence for his long-term\noffender designation, on three occasions. He was first released in April 2010,\nand breached three conditions of his release by travelling to the Pasqua First\nNation, consuming alcohol and assaulting his common-law wife in October 2010.\nIn the result, the accused was convicted of assault in February 2011. He was\nsentenced to one year consecutive, and his statutory release was revoked. As\nthe Crown noted, the October 2010 breaches occurred very shortly after the\nexpiration of a condition that the accused live in a community correctional facility.[6]The accused was\nagain granted statutory release in August 2013. He breached his conditions by\nfailing to abstain from alcohol and drugs in 2013, and again in 2014, resulting\nin the revocation of his release in May 2014.[7]The accused was\ngranted statutory release for a third time in September 2014. He reached his\nwarrant expiry date on December 27, 2014, resulting in the commencement of his\nLTSO, which included conditions that he abstain from alcohol and reside at the\nOskana Center for six months. The Crown noted that the breach resulting in the\noffence for which the accused will now be sentenced was also committed very\nshortly after the expiration of that residency condition.[8]The Crown filed\nrecords from the Correctional Service of Canada, and a National Parole Board\nassessment and decision at the sentencing hearing. Those records include a\nseries of Correction’s plans and assessments from January 2003 to July 2015.\nThey confirm that the accused generally performed well while incarcerated, and\nhad participated in all required core programming. His 2015 assessments\nconclude that he has made progress. Officials believed he was motivated to\nchange, and appeared to have both gained insight into his stressors and improved\nhis ability to identify and implement positive coping mechanisms. They indicate\nthat his drug and alcohol screens were negative for the first six months of his\nLTSO, that he obtained employment and was in a potentially supportive\nrelationship with his new wife.[9]These records\nalso confirmed, however, that the accused is capable of extreme violence, and\nthat alcohol has contributed to his offending. A May 5, 2013 assessment, for\nexample, contains the following summary description:The HCR-20 and VRAG indicate a low risk of general\nrecidivism and a high risk for violence; E.W.’s history indicates long periods\nof controlled emotional instability, and explosive rage with violence. In the\ncommunity the offender is prone to display emotional instability and poor\nmanagement of emotions and self control. His actions indicate that he can be\nimpulsive when bombarded with distorted emotions that are led by arguments that\ncause frustration. E.W.’srisk of instability is exacerbated when he isunder the influence of intoxicants that hinder hisjudgment and ability to rationalize the outcome of his decisions.[10]The March 3, 2015\nassessment contains similar comments, including drawing the readily apparent\nlink - which the accused admits - between his long struggle with alcohol abuse\nand violence, as follows:File information indicates that E.W.’s primary risk\nfactors that have contributed to his criminal offending behaviour appear to be\nhis substance abuse, negative peer associations, impulsive behaviour and\ninability to link behaviours with consequences. He appears to be vulnerable to\nnegative peer influence and when under the influence of substance is easily\nprovoked to impulsive acts of violence.[11]The accused is a\nFirst Nations person. Members of his family, including four of his six\nsiblings, attended residential school, and some of his siblings were placed in\nfoster care. He was abandoned by his caregiver at the age of 12, and was\nobliged to take care of himself and his siblings at an early age. He also\nexperienced physical, emotional and mental abuse during childhood. Although the\naccused at one stage expressed an interest in participating in cultural\nceremonies while incarcerated, there is no evidence that he pursued that\ninterest. It is reported in his May 5, 2013 assessment that he was not\ninterested in participating in elder interventions at that time.Law[12]Ipeelee constituted a significant change in\nthe approach to sentencing for breach of an LTSO. LeBel J. there confirmed (see\ngenerally paras. 40 – 54) as follows:•An LTSO,\nwhich is a form of conditional release governed by the Corrections and\nConditional Release Act, SC 1992, c 20, has two objectives: “(1) protecting\nthe public from the risk of reoffence, and (2) rehabilitating the offender and\nreintegrating him or her into the community” (para. 48).•Although\nrehabilitation and reintegration are the ultimate purpose of an LTSO,\nrehabilitation is not always the primary consideration when sentencing for\nbreach of an LTSO. Rather, a sentencing judge must “…apply all of the\nprinciples mandated by ss. 718.1 and 718.2 of the Criminal Code in order\nto devise a sentence that furthers the overall objectives of sentencing.” As\nwith any sentencing decision, the relative weight to be accorded to each\nsentencing principle or objective will vary depending on the circumstances of\nthe particular offence. In all instances, the sentence must be proportionate to\nboth the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the\naccused”. (para. 51)•The ten\nyear maximum penalty for a breach of an LTSO indicates that Parliament views\nthe breach of an LTSO more seriously than the breach of a probation order.\nHowever, there is no minimum sentence, and all sentencing options are\navailable. (para. 54)•The\nsentencing judge must determine, within this open range of sentencing options,\na sentence proportionate to both the gravity of the offence and the degree of\nresponsibility of the offender. As LeBel J. stated:The severity of a particular breach of an LTSO will\ndepend, in large part, on the circumstances of the breach, the nature of the\ncondition breached, and the role that condition plays in managing the offender's\nrisk of reoffence in the community. This requires a contextual analysis. As Smith\nJ.A. states in R. v. Deacon, 2004 BCCA 78 (CanLII), 193 B.C.A.C. 228 (B.C. C.A.),\nat para. 51, \"the gravity of an offence under s. 753.3 must be measured\nwith reference not only to the conduct that gave rise to the offence, but also\nwith regard to what it portends in light of the offender's entire history of\ncriminal conduct.[13]Ipeelee also confirmed that ss. 718.2(e) of\nthe Criminal Code must, as in every case, be taken into account in\nsentencing for breach of an LTSO. That does not mean that an accused convicted\nof a breach of s.753.3 is entitled to what LeBel J. referred to as a\n“race-based discount”.Rather, as he put the matter, referring to the\nprinciples specified in R v Gladue, 1999 CanLII 679 (SCC), [1999] 1 SCR 688 [Gladue]:75 … sentencing judges are required to pay particular\nattention to the circumstances of Aboriginal offenders in order to endeavour to\nachieve a truly fit and proper sentence in any particular case. This has been,\nand continues to be, the fundamental duty of a sentencing judge. Gladue\nis entirely consistent with the requirement that sentencing judges engage in an\nindividualized assessment of all of the relevant factors and circumstances,\nincluding the status and life experiences, of the person standing before them.\n…[14]In this case, both\ncounsel submitted, and I agree, that a period of incarceration is the correct\nsentence. The accused has been in custody almost continuously since 2000. He\nhas completed addictions and other programming directed at his needs. Defence\ncounsel did not propose a restorative justice approach. Indeed, he submitted\nthat a sentence that would call for this accused to confront those elements of\nhis past that engage Gladue principles might be unhelpful.[15]The particular Gladue\nprinciple that must nonetheless be considered is that, as LeBel J. noted (at\npara. 73 of Ipeelee), “systemic and background factors may bear on the\nculpability of the offender, to the extent that they shed light on his or her\nlevel of moral blameworthiness”. As Richards C.J.S. emphasized in R v\nChanalquay, 2015 SKCA 141 (CanLII), [2016] 4 WWR 242, however:52A sentencing judge should not simply stack up all\nof the Gladue-type considerations at play in a case and, if the list is\nlong or severe, automatically proceed on the assumption such factors have had a\nsubstantial limiting effect on the offender's culpability. The required\nanalysis is more demanding than that. To determine the extent to which Gladue\nfactors impact on an offender's moral culpability, a sentencing judge must\nexamine both the nature of the relevant factors and the particulars of the\ncrime in issue. He or she should then consider the extent to which the unique\ncircumstances of the offender \"bear on his or her culpability\" (Ipeelee\nat para 83) in the specific context of the case at hand. As mandated by the\nSupreme Court, the search here is not for a cause-and-effect relationship but\nfor circumstances that cast light on the degree of the offender's\nblameworthiness for the specific offence in issue. It might be that the Gladue\nconsiderations impact the offender's culpability a great deal, not at all, or\nonly to some intermediate extent.[16]As he further\nnoted (at para. 54), “a finding of reduced moral culpability rooted in Gladue\nfactors does not automatically lead to a shorter period of incarceration.”[17]The fundamental\npurpose and objectives of sentencing are set out in s. 718 of the Criminal\nCode, which provides as follows:718 The fundamental purpose of sentencing is to\nprotect society and to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to\nrespect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by\nimposing just sanctions that have one or more of the following objectives:(a) to denounce unlawful conduct and the harm done to\nvictims or to the community that is caused by unlawful conduct;(b) to deter the offender and other persons from\ncommitting offences;(c) to separate offenders from society, where\nnecessary;(d) to assist in rehabilitating offenders; …[18]The fundamental\nprinciple of sentencing, which is specified bys. 718.1 of the Criminal Code, is that a sentence “must be proportionate\nto the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the\noffender.” Section 718.2 of the Criminal Code requires that I take\naccount of any aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence\nor the offender. It also requires that I consider the principle of parity. That\nis, “a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for\nsimilar offences committed in similar circumstances”.Positions\nof the Parties[19]Counsel for the\naccused focused squarely on rehabilitation as a sentencing objective. He\nsubmitted that the Crown’s characterization of the accused’s criminal record as\none of uninterrupted violence did not take proper account of the fact that his\noffending has been “on a downward trend”, and that his more recent actions\nsupport the conclusion that he has gained insights and is internalizing his\nrehabilitation programming. In his view, it is important not to interrupt that\nrehabilitative process by imposing a further period of incarceration. He noted\nthat the accused has already been in custody and thus without access to alcohol\nsince July 2015.[20]As to the\ncircumstances of the offence, defence counsel submitted that the most likely\nexplanation for the accused’s behaviour was that he expected to be arrested for\na very serious offence. He suggested that his decision to drink was equivalent\nto a condemned man having one last cigarette before the firing squad. He also\nsuggested that the circumstances of the offence were less serious as they were\ncommitted “without guile”.[21]Crown counsel, on\nthe other hand, emphasized the accused’s lengthy and serious criminal record,\nand his several breaches while on statutory release and now while subject to an\nLTSO for the same offence. He submitted that the accused has demonstrated a\nclear pattern of committing breaches when he is no longer under close\nsupervision in a correctional facility. He noted that the accused committed the\nmajority of his offences while intoxicated. In his view, the accused presents a\nserious risk to the public, and that protection of the public, denunciation and\ndeterrence should be the primary considerations in this case.[22]The Crown also\nsubmitted, relying on R v Gatza, 2016 ABPC 37 (CanLII) [Gatza], that the\naccused should not receive enhanced credit for the time spent in custody since\nhis arrest on July 27, 2015, as the accused’s long-term supervision order has\ncontinued to run pending this sentencing. Gatza relies on R v Bourdon,\n2012 ONCA 256 (CanLII), 110 OR (3d) 168 [Bourdon], finding that it would be\nanomalous for an offender to receive both enhanced credit and credit towards\nhis LTSO.Analysis[23]In my view, there\nare several key considerations in this case.The accused may well be motivated\nto change, and appears to have made progress since 2003. However, he has a long\nhistory of alcohol abuse, and a long history of breaching court orders,\nincluding the 2010 breach involving alcohol and violence, and three recent\nbreaches while on statutory release. Based on this history and the\ncircumstances of this offence, I conclude that there is a very significant risk\nthat the accused will turn to alcohol, particularly if faced with stress. There\nis compelling evidence that he has been repeatedly and easily provoked to\nviolence when he is intoxicated, and that as a result, he presents a\nsignificant risk to public safety. Further, and with respect, I do not agree\nwith defence counsel that the circumstances of the offence are less serious\nbecause the accused drank “without guile”, in the face of the police. Faced\nwith stress, the accused drank, and did so defiantly.[24]It would, of\ncourse, be inappropriate to sentence the accused as if he breached by drinking\nand committing a violent offence. As LeBel J. noted in Ipeelee: (at\npara. 91)… A fit sentence should seek to manage the risk of\nreoffence he continues to pose to the community in a manner that addresses his\nalcohol abuse, rather than punish him for what might have been. To engage in\nthe latter would certainly run afoul of the principles of fundamental justice.[25]That said, the\ncondition of his LTSO that the accused abstain from alcohol is a key to\nmanaging the risk that he will reoffend. I am very concerned by “what it portends\nin light of the offender's entire history of criminal conduct”. (Ipeelee\nat para. 55)[26]I have considered\nthe potential impact of a further period of incarceration on the rehabilitation\nof the accused. I do not share the concern expressed by defence counsel that\nfurther incarceration may compromise the accused’s progress. Gladue\nfactors have contributed to the accused’s pattern of alcohol abuse, and\naccordingly reduce his blameworthiness for this offence. However, it is my view\nthat protection of the public and deterrence are the sentencing objectives that\nshould be given the greatest weight in this case.[27]Having taken all\nof these factors into account, I sentence the accused to 15 months. In my view,\nthat sentence is consistent with the principles and purposes of sentencing,\nincluding the principle of parity, which calls for a longer sentence than those\nimposed in Ipeelee. The accused shall receive 11 months credit for the\ntime spent in custody since July 27, 2015, for the reasons specified in Bourdon.[28]The accused shall\npay a victim fine surcharge of $200, within 90 days of his release from\ncustody.J.B.A. BARRINGTON-FOOTE"}

J. TOMKINS, J[1]On August 5, 2008, three young men reported to the Regina Police Service\nthat they had been robbed the evening before.They had been walking by a\nresidential park when a man called them over.It is conceded that the man was\nthe accused, Chad Rogers, and that he was very intoxicated.[2]When the young men did not come after he called to them, Mr. Rogers\nasked them whether they were scared and suggested that they should be.He\njumped in front of them and demanded theirmoney, threatening that someone\nwould be hurt if they did not give it.[3]When the first young man responded that he had no money, Mr. Rogers hit\nhim in the face.The second young man showed his wallet and that it was empty;\nMr. Rogers knocked receipts from his hand and punched him in the face.He then\nhit the first young man again.[4]In the meantime, Mr. Rogers had realized that the third young man was\nrelated to a friend of his and sent him away.No threats were made to him, nor\nwas money demanded from him.Instead, he went to the mutual friend who came to\nthe scene and settled events.[5]Neither of the young men suffered significant injury as a result of the\nviolence used against them.[6]Based on these incidents, Mr. Rogers was charged that he, with intent to\nsteal Canadian currency, used violence toward Thomas Wilkes and Terry Selinger\nand thereby committed the offence of robbery, contrary to section 344(b) of the\nCriminal Code.Mr. Rogers pleaded guilty to this charge.[7]I must fix an appropriate sentence for Mr. Rogers.Personal\nCircumstances of the Accused, Chad Rogers[8]Mr. Rogers is 29 years old and was 27 at the time of this offence.[9]He has a prior record, both as a youth and an adult, including three\nconvictions involving violence. The most recent of these, and the only such\nconviction as an adult, was for common assault almost ten years ago.His most\nrecent convictions were made in November 2010.[10]Mr. Rogers is the third child in a hard-working family and his behaviour\nwas challenging and distressing for them for some time.However, his mother\nprovided a letter in which she says that he has “done a complete turnaround” in\nthe last 3 ½ years.She says that whereas he used to associate with\nquestionable people, he is now settled with a wonderful woman and works hard at\nhis job.She says the family is proud of him and it is implicit in her letter\nthat there was a significant period of time when she could not have said this.[11]I was also provided a letter from Mr. Rogers’ employer.He says that\nMr. Rogers has worked at his bar and grill since April 2010 and is a very\nvalued employee.While he began in more menial roles, he has worked hard and\nwillingly and is now a strong leader in the workplace.He is seen as reliable\nand trustworthy.He will be welcomed back when his sentence has been\ncompleted.Submissions\nof Counsel[12]For the Crown, Ms. Calvert drew my attention to R. v. McKay[1]\nwhere a sentence of two years less a day was imposed.Based on that case\nand the fact that the circumstances in McKay were more serious than\nthose before me, the Crown admits that an appropriate sentence for Mr. Rogers\nwill be less than that imposed on Mr. McKay.She suggests a sentence of 18\nmonths incarceration.[13]Mr. Behler, on the other hand, submitted that Mr. Rogers’ offence is on\nthe lower end of the scale for robbery and urged me to consider a sentence in\nthe range of three to nine months incarceration, followed by probation.Analysis[14]In imposing a sentence for Mr. Rogers, I must be mindful of the purposes\nand objectives of sentencing set out in the Criminal Code.[15]Section 718 states that the fundamental purposes of sentencing are to\ncontribute to respect for the law and to maintain a just, peaceful and safe\nsociety.The objectives of sentencing are:·denunciation\nof unlawful conduct;·deterring\nthe offender and others from committing offences;·separating\noffenders from society, when necessary;·assisting\nin the rehabilitation of offenders;·promoting\na sense of responsibility in offenders;·providing\nreparations for harm done to victims or the community; and·acknowledging\nthe harm done to victims and to the community.[16]Sections 718.1 and 718.2 set out principles that must be applied in\ndetermining an appropriate sentence.The following of the principles are most\napplicable to this matter:·The\nsentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of\nresponsibility of the offender.·The\nsentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for\nsimilar offences committed in similar circumstances; and·The\nsentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating\nor mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender.[17]In Mr. Rogers’ case, there are a number of aggravating factors.His\noffence involved the use of violence and, equally offensive, the instillation\nof fear in his three victims.The violence was entirely gratuitous as the\nthree young men did not have any money and told Mr. Rogers so; the infliction\nof injury did not and could not yield the result Mr. Rogers sought.[18]Mr. Rogers has a significant record both as a youth and adult, including\none conviction for common assault and two for assault with a weapon.His\nrecord also shows convictions for, among many others, uttering threats, weapon\npossession, property offences and obstruction.[19]In mitigation, however, I note that the most recent conviction involving\nviolence was for common assault and that conviction is almost ten years old.\nThe weapons-related charges are years older than that.His most recent\nproperty-related offence is also almost ten years old.[20]His November 2010 convictions are in regard to offences that occurred\nbetween 2003 and 2007.Including this conviction, which involves an offence in\nAugust 2008, he has no record for offences at all in the last two and a half\nyears.[21]I think it mitigating that the offence was neither sophisticated nor\npremeditated and that no weapons were involved.I am also impressed that Mr.\nRogers personally apologized to his victims some time ago.[22]Mr. Rogers’ counsel says that Mr. Rogers finally “gets it” and that he\nis unlikely to return to the pattern of criminal conduct that his record\nsuggests.I have reason to believe that this is not puffery.[23]First, I am mindful of the emotional but apparently honest words of Mr.\nRogers’ mother, suggesting that he has turned himself around in recent years.Her submission is supported by the fact that there are no offences, including\nthis one, after August 2008.It is also supported by the very positive letter\nof reference provided by Mr. Rogers’ employer; he does not describe a man who\nis walking a downward path.[24]Against these factors, I turn to sentencing decisions in other cases.[25]The Crown urged me to consider R. v. McKay, supra.I\nagree with the Crown that the case involves circumstances that are more serious\nthan those before me.[26]Mr. McKay approached two mentally-challenged boys near an autoteller.Mr. McKay accosted the older of them and demanded $100.00.The victim did not\nhave this amount but offered the few cents he had in his pocket.Mr. McKay\nrefused the offer.He pushed the younger brother and punched the victim in the\nface.A passerby intervened and held Mr. McKay until the police arrived.[27]Mr. McKay was on bail for an offence of violence – aggravated assault –\nat the time of this offence.His bail conditions included a curfew and\nabstinence; he was in breach of both of these conditions, as well as that to\nkeep the peace and be of good behaviour, at the time of this offence.[28]Also, Mr. McKay, while only 22 years old, had a relatively lengthy\nrecord including at least 35 convictions.[29]These factors, plus the fact that his victims were visibly vulnerable,\nrender Mr. McKay’s offence more serious.[30]Other cases submitted for my consideration include R. v. Cheekinew[2],\nR. v. Peepeetch[3], R. v.\nPakula[4], R. v.\nSmallboy[5], R. v.\nHunter[6] and R. v.\nMoorehead[7].In each of\nthese casesthe robberies involved some or all of: weapons, more serious\nassaults with more serious consequences to the victims and offenders with more\nserious records.All involve multiple assailants against single victims.It\nis likely for these reasons that in all but two - Cheekinew and Pakula\n- the Court of Appeal imposed or upheld sentences in excess of that sought\nby the Crown in this case.[31]Mr. Rogers’ offence is distinguished in that it involves none of these\nfactors.Given this and the fact that the Crown does not seek a sentence\nexceeding 18 months incarceration,I turn to the two authorities that imposed\nsentences within the range the Crown seeks in this case.[32]In Cheekinew, the Court of Appeal upheld a sentence of 18 months\nincarceration.Mr. Cheekinew and his brother approached the victim and asked\nfor cigarettes and money.When the victim declined, Mr. Cheekinew grabbed him,\nrifled his pockets and took a water bottle from him.The victim tried to flee\nonto the bus but before he did, Mr. Cheekinew punched him with such force that\nhis tooth was chipped and his right eye was swollen.Mr. Cheekinew’s record\nincluded two prior convictions for robbery.Clearly, Mr. Cheekinew’s\ncircumstances and those of the offence are more aggravated than those in the\ncase before me.[33]In Pakula, the offender and four others drove alongside the\nvictim who was riding a bike.When the victim rebuked him, the offender chased\nhim down.Another man from the car told the victim to stop “lipping off” and\npushed him, causing him to fall off the bike.Mr. Pakula then showed a pair of\nscissors and threatened to use them if the victim did not surrender the bike.Fortunately, the victim was able to ride away.[34]Believing this was Mr. Pakula’s first offence, the trial judge suspended\nsentence and placed Mr. Pakula on probation for one year.In fact, Mr. Pakula\nhad misled the court.He had nine previous convictions, at least five of which\nwere related.By the time his appeal was heard, he had completed five months\nin a community training centre.Taking this into account, the Court of Appeal\nallowed the Crown’s appeal and imposed a sentence of ten months’ incarceration\nfollowed by two years of probation.[35]I have also considered R. v. Rollheiser[8].Mr. Rollheiser and two others, after an afternoon of drinking, went for a\nwalk.They came upon and approached a group of six boys under 16 years of\nage.In a menacing manner, Mr. Rollheiser and his co-accused threatened and\nintimidated the young boys over a period of 30 to 45 minutes. Eventually one of\nthe boys offered to give them money.The accused and his co-accused took it\nand demanded more.Two of the others anted up small amounts.By this point\nthe young boys were able to run and they did.[36]This robbery and a concurrent conviction for assault were Mr.\nRollheiser’s first criminal offences.He had a supportive family and was\nconsidered a low risk to re-offend.A sentence of 90 days incarceration\nfollowed by one year probation was upheld by the Court of Appeal.[37]Counsel are agreed that there will be a custodial sentence in this\ncase.I agree.A non-custodial sentence in these circumstances and given the\nrecord of this accused could not be supported.[38]I am satisfied that an appropriate sentence will be significantly lower\nthan that imposed in McKay but certainly higher than that in Rollheiser.Of the authorities provided, I find Rollheiser and Pakula most\ninstructive.[39]I have considered the sentences imposed in those cases - 90 days and ten\nmonths - and the favourable and aggravating factors that distinguish those cases\nfrom Mr. Rogers’ case.I have also considered the aggravating factors at play\nin this case, but also the many mitigating factors.[40]In fixing an appropriate sentence for Mr. Rogers, I am satisfied that\nthe sentence ought not to be so long as to irreparably disrupt Mr. Rogers’\nprogress toward rehabilitation but must adequately denounce his conduct and\ndeter others.[41]I am also mindful that Mr. Rogers’ actions on the day of this offence,\nand indeed for virtually all of his record, were influenced by alcohol.He has\na problem with alcohol which he has apparently had some success keeping under\ncontrol.It is critical to his rehabilitation that he receive assistance with\nhis efforts in this respect.Primarily for this reason, a period of probation\nwill follow his incarceration.Keeping totality in mind, the period of\nincarceration must be such as to reflect the additional penalty of probation.[42]For all of these reasons, Mr. Rogers will be sentenced to a period of\nsix months incarceration, followed by a period of 12 months probation.[43]The terms of the probation will be that he:·keep\nthe peace and be of good behaviour;·attend\nCourt as and when required by the Court;·report\nto Probation Services within three working days of his release from custody and\nthereafter report as required by his probation officer;·abide\nby all reasonable and lawful instructions of his probation officer, including\nany instruction that he attend for assessment, counselling and/or programming\nfor substance abuse; and·if\nreferred for assessment, counselling or programming for substance abuse,\nparticipate actively and not behave in such manner as might cause him to be\ndismissed therefrom.[44]There will be an order under section 109 of the Criminal Code\nprohibiting Mr. Rogers from possessing any firearm, cross-bow, prohibited\nweapon, restricted weapon, prohibited device, ammunition, prohibited ammunition\nor explosive substance or all such things.[45]There will be an order under section 487.051 requiring Mr. Rogers to\nprovide the number of samples of bodily substances that is reasonably required\nfor the purpose of forensic DNA analysis.[46]In light of the imposition of a custodial sentence, there will be no\nVictim Impact Surcharge imposed.Comment[47]Mr. Rogers’ mother urged me not to impose a custodial sentence.She\nsuggested, in effect, that it would serve no purpose.I understand her\nposition – that her son has changed his ways and is living a positive\nlifestyle.She sees no benefit if this is disrupted.[48]In imposing a suitable sentence, I must be mindful of purposes well\nbeyond Mr. Rogers’ current circumstances.I must consider the seriousness of\nthe offence and robbery is certainly serious.Mr. Rogers must accept\nresponsibility and be accountable.[49]I must consider deterrence, not just for Mr. Rogers but for others who\nmight commit similar offences.Of course, I must also consider Mr. Rogers’\nrehabilitation but this is only one factor among many that must be balanced.[50]I believe the sentence I have imposed addresses all relevant principles\nand objectives in a balanced manner.Dated at Regina,\nSaskatchewan this 17th day of February, 2011.______________________________________B.

FISHMARIE DESCHAMPS, JJ.A.ERNEST JANTUAH,APPELLANT -\naccusedv.HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN,RESPONDENT -\nprosecutrixOPINION\nOF FISH, J.A.IErnest\nJantuah pleaded guilty on April 7, 1993, to a charge of importing into Canada\napproximately 475 grams of heroin.For that offence, he was sentenced on June\n3 to imprisonment for 10 years.Pursuant to article 741.2 of the Criminal\nCode, the judge also ordered that Jantuah serve one half of his sentence\nbefore he may be released on full parole.He gave no specific reasons for\ndoing so.On June\n22, 1993, Jantuah notified the Crown of his intention to appeal the order made\nagainst him under section 741.2 of the Code.His motion for leave did\nnot question the fitness of the sentence itself and, to that extent, did not\nput the 10-year term of imprisonment in issue.Four\nmonths later, on October 20, 1993, the Crown advised appellant that it would\nurge this Court to increase the 10-year sentence.At the\nhearing of the appeal on December 8, 1993, we granted the appellant's motion\nfor leave and reserved judgment on the two remaining issues:first, as to the\norder made by the judge under section 741.2;second, as to the Crown's\napplication for a more severe sentence.On the\nfirst issue, this appeal is governed by R. v. Dankyi, C.A.M.,\n1993 CanLII 4283 (QC CA), 500-10-000158-939, November 15, 1993, J.E. 93-1940, andR. v. Leblanc,\nC.A.M., 1993 CanLII 4287 (QC CA), 500-10-000285-930, November 17, 1993, which were both decided after the\nJudge had imposed sentence in this case.For the very reasons set out in Dankyi\nand Leblanc, the order made against Jantuah under section 741.2 of the Code\ncannot stand.Accordingly, I would set it aside.In\ndealing with the second issue, I shall assume, without deciding, that we are\nentitled, under the authority of Hill v. The Queen (No. 2) (1975), 1975 CanLII 38 (SCC), 25\nC.C.C. (2d) 6 (S.C.C.), to increase the appellant's sentence on an appeal by\nhim against the order made under Section 741.2 of the Criminal Code.I shall assume as well that we can properly permit the Crown, more than four\nmonths after sentence has been rendered, to place the fitness of the sentence\nin issue for the first time, and this without the Court's leave and without an\nextension of delays.IIThe\nCrown's notice raises the following grounds:a)la\nnature du crime:importation de stupéfiant.b)la\nnature du stupéfiant:héroïne.c)la\nquantité:475 grammes.d)le degré de\npureté du stupéfiant.e)la valeur du\nstupéfiant sur le marché.f)l'implication\nde l'appelant dans le crime commis.g)le\ndésir de donner effet à la volonté réelle du juge de première instance, telle\nque manifestée lors de l'imposition de la sentence.At the\nhearing of the appeal, Crown counsel quite properly abandoned ground g),\nrecognizing that it was untenable on the face of the record:in imposing\nsentence, the judge gave his reasons for fixing a 10-year term of imprisonment without\nany reference at all to section 741.2 of Criminal Code.Only\nafterward,in response to the Crown's request, did the judge make an order\nunder that section.With\nrespect to grounds d), e), and f), the record provides no basis for\nintervention.The purity and value of the narcotic were dealt with\nperfunctorily, if at all, at trial.As to the implication of the appellant in\nthe crime that concerns us, there is some evidence concerning his apparently\nuncommon skill in ingesting and expelling heroin-laden condoms with speed and\nefficiency.There is also ground for suspicion, arising out of entries in the\nappellant's passport, that he has on more than one occasion travelled\ninternational routes said to be favoured by traffickers in narcotics.This\nmight well justify serious doubt whether the appellant was engaged in his first\nnefarious adventure, but it does not in my view establish that he was anything\nmore than a courier.The more\ndifficult question is whether, on the remaining grounds ── gravity\nof the crime, harmfulness of heroin, and quantity involved in this case ── the\nsentence imposed is inadequate and therefore requires correction.The\nappellant, it should be noted, was detained for nearly six months prior to\nreceiving his sentence, which is thus equivalent to an 11-year term.More\nsevere sentences have been either imposed or confirmed by this Court.Generally speaking, however, the more severe sentences have involved\nsignificantly larger quantities of heroin.Where sentences of 15 years have\nbeen imposed in Superior Court or on appeal, the reported quantities were in\nmost instances three or more times greater than in this case:see Chetrit,\nCAM 1990 CanLII 2990 (QC CA), 500-10-000171-866, December 11, 1990, J.E. 91-166, 2.6 kilos;Hooter,\nSCT 700-01-002349-929, December 21, 1992, 3.06 kilos;Yazdani (1993),\n50 QAC 288, 3 kilos;Brullo (1989), 16 QAC 136, 1.5 kilos.Both here\nand elsewhere in Canada, sentences of 12 years' imprisonment or less have not\nbeen unusual:Mediratta (1988), 29 OAC 333, 7 years;Sair, QL\nreference [1988] O.J. No. 1428, Nelson-Kent, BCCA No. 009032, June 3,\n1988, 12 years;Setoudah, C.A.M. 1988 CanLII 1292 (QC CA), 500-10-000368-884, December 7, 1988,\nJ.E. 89-275, 42 months;Tsoi and Chan (1982), 36 A R 606 (QB), 12 and\n10 years;Lagos, BCCA No. CA 002009, October 16, 1984, 10 years;Marshall,\nBCCA No. CA V00730, November 15, 1988, 5 years.Some of these cases involved\nless than a pound of heroin;in others, the quantity was much greater.In Mediratta,\nfor example, the accused had imported 3.64 pounds of heroin having an estimated\nstreet value of one to three million dollars.Speaking for the Court, Zuber\nJ.A. considered that a seven-year sentence was justified because the drug was\nheroin, the quantity was large, and the sole motivation was lucre.This\nstatement was expressly approved by the Ontario Court of Appeal in Sair,\nwhich involved an even larger quantity than Mediratta, valued at 4.8\nmillion dollars.Dubin A.C.J.O. (now C.J.O.) and McKinley and Griffiths JJ.A.\nwere, in Sair, \"all of the view... that the sentence of seven years\nwas a fit and proper one\".IIIAssuming\nwithout deciding, as I said earlier, that we are entitled on this appeal by\nJantuah to increase his sentence at the request of the Crown, I would decline\nto do so.In\nrelation to other sentences imposed in this jurisdiction for like offences\ncommitted in similar circumstances, a 10-year term of imprisonment does not\nappear severe, even after six months of preventive detention.Nor, on the\nother hand, was it so strikingly inadequate as to provoke a timely appeal by\nthe Crown.In the\nresult, I would allow Jantuah's appeal and set aside the order made against him\nunder section 741.2 of the Criminal Code.I would decline to increase\nthe sentence, as requested by the Crown, since I am not persuaded that 10\nyears' imprisonment is, in the circumstances of this case, an unfit punishment,\nwithin the meaning of section 687(1) of the Criminal Code.MORRIS\nJ.

(orally)[1]The appellant pled guilty to one count\nof fraud exceeding $200 and one count of attempted fraud exceeding $5,000.The\ndate of the first offence occurred between January 1, 1980 and December 31,\n1980 and the second offence occurred between January 1, 2000 and December 31,\n2000.He was sentenced to 14 months in jail and ordered to pay restitution in\nthe amount of $10,273.77.[2]Both the charges arose out of the\nappellant misrepresenting to the Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation\n(“SCIC”) the amount of acreage he actually seeded.[3]The restitution order was based on the\ntotal claim made on the four quarters of farmland the appellant owned.In\nfact, the over-claimed acreage was only on one quarter section and the amount\nactually defrauded was $3,457.28.The Crown agreed, and correctly, the appeal\nshould be allowed to the extent of correcting the restitution order but argued\nthe sentence of incarceration was a fit sentence.[4]The second false claim giving rise to\nthe attempted fraud was discovered before it was paid out and SCIC refused to\nindemnify the appellant. Had the false claim been paid out it would have\namounted to $24,934.60.[5]The appellant claims his sentence is\nunfit because it fails to recognize the principle of parity, that is, the\nsentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for\nsimilar offences committed in similar circumstances.He further argues he\nought to have received a conditional sentence.[6]At the sentencing hearing defence\ncounsel and the Crown agreed the sentence should be 18 months and the argument\npresented to the sentencing judge was whether the sentence should be a\nconditional sentence or incarceration.Given the agreed submission as to the\nlength of sentence the issue of parity was never argued before the sentencing\njudge.[7]The sentencing judge clearly addressed\nthe need for denunciation and deterrence when crimes such as these are\ncommitted.People who take dishonest advantage of publicly funded programs of\nthis nature undermine the integrity of the very programs themselves.Crop\nInsurance relies on farmers to provide accurate production information.In R.\nv. Frampton,[1] Tallis J.A. had this to say:[2]…In this case the learned trial\njudge emphasized the importance of deterrence (in its widest sense) in the\nfollowing passage:This is a case\nwhere deterrence of others is of paramount consideration.Farmers who defraud\nSaskatchewan Crop Insurance are stealing from their friends and neighbours, and\nmust absorb the loss by paying increased crop insurance premiums.As well, the\nfraud constitutes a huge breach of faith because Crop Insurance adjusters trust\nthat farmers will provide accurate production information.The trust element\nis integral to adjusting the loss, in that it is relatively simple for\nunscrupulous farmers to beat the system.It is necessary that the farming\ncommunity should understand that a conviction for cheating Saskatchewan Crop\nInsurance will attract harsh consequences.Those who sample the easy pickings\nof Sask. Crop Insurance must pay a painful price.[8]The type of sentences for crimes of\nthis nature range from a conditional sentence in R. v. Moulton[2] to a period of incarceration of 22 months in R. v. Traynor[3] depending on the usual factors including the amount defrauded.[9]In R. v. Chubey[4] where the accused unlawfully obtained an extension of credit in the\namount of $41,875 the term of imprisonment was set at five months on appeal.In\nR. v. Clay[5] where the accused unlawfully obtained an extension of credit in the\namount of approximately $90,000 he was sentenced to a term of five months\nimprisonment on appeal.A sentence of six months incarceration was upheld in Frampton\nwhere the amount of the fraud against SCIC was $17,700; and in R. v. Rezansoff[6] where the accused attempted to collect from Crop Insurance $10,000\nto which he was not entitled, the Court upheld a sentence of six months imprisonment.[10]We are all of the view the sentence\nbelow was unfit and a term of incarceration of seven months is appropriate in\nthe circumstances.Deterrence of others must continue to be of paramount\nconsideration when these crimes are committed.The appellant defrauded the\nCorporation once and attempted to do it again.[11]As stated above, the Crown conceded\nthat the restitution order should be reduced to $3,457.28 from $10,273.77.If\nthe full amount has already been paid, there will be an order directing a\nrefund to the appellant for the difference.The appeal therefore is allowed\nand a sentence of seven months incarceration is imposed and the restitution\norder is set at $3,457.28.[1]\n(1997), 1997 CanLII 9756 (SK CA), 152 Sask.

The issue for the court is to determine a fit and proper sentence in\nall of the circumstances of this offence and this particular offender.[2]The Crown recommends a\njail sentence of 90 days followed by a period of probation of 2 years, a\nsection 110 Criminal Code firearms order for 5 years and a DNA order\nunder section 487.051 of the Code since the assault and threats charges\nare secondary designated offences.[3]Defence counsel submits\nthat, in all of the circumstances of the case, a fit and proper sentence would\nbe a conditional sentence order in the range of 6 months followed by a period\nof probation for 18 months. The Defence has no objection to the ancillary\norders.CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENCES:[4]During the early\nmorning hours of October 21, 2010, Mr. Sydney went to 737 Fern Drive in\nBeaverbank, Nova Scotia which was the residence of his former partner, Pamela\nHarris. Ms. Harris is the mother of their son, William, who is 3 years old and\nresides with his mother. Mr. Sydney was intoxicated when he attended at his\nformer partner’s residence. He did not have a key to get in the residence and\nstarted banging on the door to gain entry. Ms. Harris let him in and scolded\nhim for arriving at that late hour as their son William was at home and still\nawake because he was sick. Ms. Harris and Mr. Sydney got into a verbal argument\nabout his banging on the door. He became more irate when she called him a\n“loser” and he eventually threatened to “bash in” her head and to harm her\nfather.[5]Mr. Sydney refused to\nleave the residence and eventually grabbed the area of Ms. Harris’ head and\nneck and threw her to the floor. Defence counsel contends that her client did\nnot place Ms. Harris in a “headlock.” However, Defence counsel says that Mr.\nSydney did attempt to hug Ms. Harris and pick her up. During that contact, his\narms accidentally slipped up to her neck and as she resisted him, he let go of\nher and she slipped and fell to the floor. In response to questions by the\ncourt for clarification, although there is a dispute as to the exact manner in\nwhich Mr. Sydney applied force to Ms. Harris, it was agreed by counsel that Ms.\nHarris had not consented to any direct application of force by Mr. Sydney which\ncaused her to fall to the floor.[6]The Crown also contends\nthat the assault of Ms. Harris by Mr. Sydney caused air to be cut off to her\nlungs for a second, however, that potentially aggravating factor is disputed by\nDefence counsel who submits that if it did occur, then that act was not\nintended, but was completely accidental. Since this remains a disputed fact, I\ndo not rely on it as an aggravating fact as it has not been established by the\nCrown beyond a reasonable doubt pursuant to section 724(3)(e) of the Criminal\nCode.[7]In addition, during his\nrecitation of the facts, the Crown Attorney indicated that there was no\nbruising, no visible bleeding and that Ms. Harris was not hospitalized.\nHowever, the Crown Attorney noted, in reviewing the Victim Impact Statement,\nthat Ms. Harris had stated that there was bruising on her neck from the\nassault. Defence counsel maintains that the disclosed facts upon which her\nclient entered his guilty plea did not contain any reference to bruising, and\nthat this alleged fact was only disclosed well after her client entered his\nguilty pleas. On further submissions by counsel in relation to this point,\nDefence counsel added that her client accepted responsibility for the assault\nof Ms. Harris and therefore, the Defence does not take issue with the fact that\nsome bruising occurred as a result of Mr. Sydney’s assault of Ms. Harris.[8]At the time when Mr.\nSydney assaulted Ms. Harris at 737 Fern Drive in Beaverbank, Nova Scotia, he\nwas subject to a probation order made September 11, 2009 which prohibited him\nfrom going to that residence. As a result of Mr. Sydney going to the residence\nof Ms. Harris between the dates alleged in the Information, without her\npermission, he breached one of the terms of his probation order.[9]Mr. Sydney spent 2 days\non remand before he was released on a Recognizance, dated October 25, 2010,\nwhich contained a curfew to remain in his residence between the hours of 10 PM\nand 6 AM the following day, 7 days per week. Defence counsel submitted that\nthese 2 days in custody had a salutary effect on her client. The Recognizance\nwas varied on February 16, 2011 to allow Mr. Sydney to contact Ms. Harris by\ntelephone for the purpose of arranging access to their child, William, or as\nset out in a Family Court order.DEVELOPMENTS AFTER SUBMISSIONS OF COUNSEL:[10]The facts and\ncircumstances of the offences relied upon by the Crown and the submissions of\ncounsel were made on September 11, 2012 and I reserved my decision on\nsentencing to September 21, 2012. At the outset of the court’s hearing on\nSeptember 21, 2012, Defence Counsel advised the court that there had been some\nrecent developments, which had just come to her attention and were not known to\nher when counsel made their submissions. Defence counsel indicated that she was\ninformed that Mr. Sydney was alleged to have breached a term of his\nRecognizance on September 7, 2012, but the charge in relation to that breach\nwas only laid after the submissions of counsel on September 11, 2012. At Mr.\nSydney’s first appearance in court on September 13, 2012, he entered a guilty\nplea to breaching a term of the Recognizance contrary to section 145(3) of the Code.\nHe was sentenced to a term of 30 days in prison, to be served intermittently,\ncommencing on September 21, 2012.[11]As a result of that\nintermittent sentence having been imposed by the court, Defence Counsel advised\nthat Mr. Sydney has lost the employment as a chef at the restaurant where he\nwould have been working under the “Red Seal” program. Counsel stated that her\nclient believes that he has another job lined up if the court was to impose a\nconditional sentence order in this case. Defence counsel also indicated that,\nif the court ordered a jail sentence of 90 days as recommended by the Crown so\nthat the sentence could be served on an intermittent basis, there would be a\nsignificant consequence for her client. Counsel stated that, if this court was\nto order a jail sentence which, when combined with the 30 day sentence imposed\non September 13, 2012, exceeded 90 day limit for sentences served on an\nintermittent basis, the consequence of this court’s order would result in an\naggregate sentence requiring Mr. Sydney to serve that sentence on a straight\ntime basis in a correctional centre. In that event, her client would not be\nable to work and his ability to make financial support payments for his son\nwould be impacted.[12]Defence counsel also\nadded that since the initial submissions were made on September 11, 2012, the\nparties have appeared in Family Court and it is now quite clear that Ms. Harris\ndoes not wish to have any direct or indirect contact with Mr. Sydney. In\naddition, counsel also advised the court that the Family Court order does allow\nfor access to their child, William, through an agreed-upon 3rd\nparty. The recent proceedings in the Family Court have clarified Ms. Harris’\nposition with respect to the issue of ongoing contact or communication with Mr.\nSydney.CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENDER:[13]Mr. Sydney is currently\n34 years old. In June 2008, he started dating Ms. Pamela Harris, now age 35,\nwho is the victim of the assault and threats charge. Mr. Sydney and Ms. Harris\nhave a 3-year-old son, William, and at the time of the preparation of the\nPre-Sentence Report, it was reported that Mr. Sydney and Ms. Harris had an\namicable relationship and that he saw his son on a regular basis. In the last\nfew months, Mr. Sydney has commenced a relationship with another woman who has\n2 children, aged 7 and 4, from a previous relationship. Mr. Sydney reported that\ntheir relationship is quite positive and that their relationship has progressed\nto the point where they would like to reside together.[14]During his formative\nyears, Mr. Sydney reported that he suffered physical abuse at the hands of his\nfather and was placed in various foster homes between age 11 and age 16. His\nsister confirmed the difficulties of his childhood and that Mr. Sydney has\nanger management issues which may have originated from their father, who also\nhad anger management issues.[15]Mr. Sydney had been\nworking as a chef for a number of years and at the time of the submissions, he\nwas working with a chef at a new restaurant under the Nova Scotia Community\nCollege’s “red seal” program. As a chef, he was required to work at the\nrestaurants on the weekends, and Defence counsel noted that if he was to be\nordered to serve a jail sentence, even on an intermittent basis, he would\nlikely lose his job. He was now paid a salary of $13 per hour and from that, he\nwas voluntarily providing some financial assistance to Ms. Harris to help with\nexpenses for his son. At the time of the submissions of counsel, there was no\ncourt order for custody, access or child support for his son.[16]Mr. Sydney has a prior,\nrelated criminal record. On June 4, 2009, he was granted a 9 month conditional\ndischarge for an assault contrary to section 266(b) of the Code which\noccurred between December 22, 2007 and March 22, 2008. It is not clear from the\nPre-sentence report or the JEIN Offender Summary Report whether this assault\ncharge involved a common-law partner. However, on September 11, 2009, it is\nclear that he was sentenced for 2 offences - a spousal assault contrary to\nsection 266 of the Code which involved Ms. Harris and a breach of\nprobation contrary to section 733.1(1)(a) of the Code.For these\nsubsequent offences, which occurred between July 12, 2009 and September 8,\n2009, Mr. Sydney was ordered to serve a conditional sentence order of 4 months\nfollowed by a period of probation of one year. Mr. Sydney was subject to the\nterms of that probation order, at the time of the current offences.[17]Since October 2010, Mr.\nSydney has been subject to the terms and conditions of a Recognizance under\nwhich he was released on bail and required to observe a curfew as well as other\nconditions. There had been no breaches of that Recognizance between October 25,\n2010 and September 7, 2012.VICTIM IMPACT:[18]Ms. Harris completed a\nvictim impact statement on September 6, 2012. In it, she reports bruising on\nher neck and stress related symptoms, such as gaining weight, hair loss and\nfeelings of anxiety and fatigue as a result of worrying for her safety and that\nof her family. She missed some days at work, has attended counseling sessions\nthrough her employee assistance program and is concerned that she will be\nharassed by Mr. Sydney. At the same time, Ms. Harris expresses psychological\nconcerns for financial security, loneliness and avoidance by friends as a\nresult of the breakdown of her relationship with Mr. Sydney.[19]During the sentencing\nsubmissions, I noted that the Victim Impact Statement contained remarks which\nindicated a significant discrepancy from the remarks attributed to her in the\nPre-Sentence Report. In the Pre-Sentence report which was prepared on August\n23, 2012, the probation officer stated that Ms. Harris had indicated that she\nstill has contact with Mr. Sydney and that they were getting along well in the\ninterests of their son. Ms. Harris was noted to have said that she did not feel\nMr. Sydney was a threat to her and therefore did not believe that there was any\nneed for a no contact condition to be ordered by the court at this time. However,\nMs. Harris’ position with respect to any ongoing direct or indirect contact and\ncommunication with Mr. Sydney has now been clarified following the receipt of\nher Victim Impact Statement and the recent Family Court proceedings.AGGRAVATING AND MITIGATING FACTORS:[20]In the Crown’s\nsubmission, a term of imprisonment is the fit and proper sentence given the\naggravating factors which are present in this case. The Crown Attorney submits\nthat the court should emphasize specific and general deterrence, denunciation\nof the unlawful conduct and the statutory aggravating factor contained in\nsection 718.2(a)(ii) of the Code, that is, that there was evidence that\nthe offender, in committing the offence, abused his common-law partner. The\nCrown also points to the aggravating factors that Mr. Sydney had committed 2\nprior assaults and that at least one of them involved Ms. Harris. In terms of\nthat spousal assault, Mr. Sydney was sentenced on September 11, 2009 to a\nconditional sentence order of 4 months, followed by a period of one year on\nprobation. Furthermore, the Crown says that it is an aggravating factor that,\nat the time of this incident, Mr. Sydney was subject to the terms of a\nprobation order which required him to stay away from the residence of Ms.\nHarris.[21]Defence counsel, in her\nsubmissions, acknowledges that her client’s actions represent a loss of self-control\nand completely unacceptable behavior. In terms of mitigating factors, counsel\nsubmits that the court should note that her client accepts full responsibility\nfor his actions, entered an early guilty plea, is remorseful, wishes to\napologize to Ms. Harris and has made numerous positive changes in his life.\nSince the incident, he has stopped drinking alcohol and completed the “New\nStart” program with respect to anger management, particularly within intimate\nrelationships. Mr. Sydney has been subject to and fully complied with a curfew\nin a Recognizance for approximately 2 years which required him to be in his\nresidence between the hours of 10 PM and 6 AM subject to limited exceptions.\nFurthermore, Defence counsel submits that Mr. Sydney’s ability to comply with\nthe terms of his Recognizance for that period of time demonstrates that he has\nthe ability to comply with terms and conditions of a conditional sentence\norder.[22]Defence counsel submits\nthat the primary purposes and principles of sentencing under section 718, 718.1\nand 718.2 of the Code which are relevant in this case should have an\nequal focus on specific and general deterrence as well as rehabilitation of the\noffender and promoting a sense of responsibility in addition to acknowledging\nthe harm done to the victim. Counsel also submits that the 2 days her client served\non remand had a salutary effect and that Mr. Sydney should not be ordered to\nserve a sentence in jail, since a less restrictive sanction would be\nappropriate in all of the circumstances of this case.[23]In terms of promoting a\nsense of responsibility, Counsel stated that Mr. Sydney had recently obtained a\nposition as a chef and that he was in the “Red Seal” Program, an apprenticeship\nprogram through the Nova Scotia Community College. In that program, he would be\neligible to earn a Certificate of Apprenticeship if he continued to work with\nthe head chef at that restaurant. Defence counsel stated that her client has\nnow lost the job that he had at the time of the submissions of counsel due to\nthe imposition of the intermittent sentence on September 13, 2012. However, if\nthe court was to order a conditional sentence of imprisonment, Mr. Sydney has\nlined up another job as a chef and therefore, his ability to pay child support to\nMs. Harris for their son would not be affected.IMPACT OF RECENT DEVELOPMENTS ON SENTENCING:[24]The first issue which\narises from the recent imposition of the 30 day intermittent sentence for the\nbreach of the curfew condition contained in the Recognizance made on October\n25, 2010, is whether that additional fact should be taken into account in this\nsentencing decision. In this regard, section 725(1) of the Criminal Code\npermits the sentencing court to consider other offences for which the\ndefendant has already been found guilty or with consent of the prosecution and\nthe defence, to consider other offences to which the offender consents to plead\nguilty and to pass sentence for those offences.[25]In R. v. Angelillo,\n2006 SCC 55 (CanLii) (CanLII), the Supreme Court of Canada examined section 725(1) of\nthe Code with regard to new charges which were alleged to have been\ncommitted while the offender was awaiting the sentencing decision, but which\ncame to light after the accused was sentenced on the other charges of a similar\nnature. Charron J. points out in para. 24 that there are many provisions of the\nCriminal Code under which evidence that is capable of showing\nthat the offender has committed another offence can be admitted at a sentencing\nhearing. For example, there is section 721(3)(b) of the Code which\nprovides that, unless otherwise specified by the court, any Pre-Sentence Report\nmust contain the history of prior convictions.[26]In Angelillo, supra,\nJustice Charron concludes in para. 24 that there is no doubt that the court may\ntake prior convictions into account in determining the appropriate sentence. In\ndoing so, the court must not punish the offender again for that other offence.\nThe fundamental principle of proportionality requires that the sentence be\nproportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of\nthe offender; a prior conviction cannot, therefore, justify a disproportionate\nsentence.[27]Madam Justice Charron\nalso points out in paragraph 32 of Angelillo, supra, that the\nsentencing court must be careful in considering extrinsic facts from other\nconcluded or uncharged offences to ensure that the court is considering those\nfacts for the purpose of establishing the offender’s character and reputation\nor risk of reoffending for the purpose of determining the appropriate sentence\nfor the offence of which he or she has been convicted. In providing a practical\nexample of how this extrinsic evidence may be considered, it is interesting to\nnote that Justice Charron utilized the example of a man who has assaulted his\nspouse and that extrinsic evidence may be adduced at the sentencing hearing by\nthe party who seeks to rely on the relevant fact to demonstrate that the act\nwas either an isolated incident or that the person was a violent offender.[28]If this extrinsic\nevidence relates to an uncharged incident that has not been determined by the\ncourt, Charron J. states that if the extrinsic evidence is contested, the\nprosecution must prove it beyond a reasonable doubt (See s. 724(3)(e) Code).\nIn addition, the sentencing judge must exclude otherwise relevant evidence if\nits prejudicial effect outweighs its probative value such that the offender’s\nright to a fair trial is jeopardized: See Angelillo, supra, at\npara.32.[29]As a result, I am\nsatisfied that Mr. Sydney’s subsequent conviction and sentence under section\n145(3) of the Code for the breach of the curfew condition contained in\nhis Recognizance, which occurred after submissions in this case, but before my\nsentencing decision, is properly before me.[30]As Charron J. pointed\nout in Angelillo, I must consider the subsequent s. 145(3) Code\nconviction in determining the offender’s character and reputation, his ability\nto potentially comply with the terms of a conditional sentence order if I was\nto impose one as well as his risk of reoffending for the purpose of determining\nthe appropriate sentence for the offences before the court today. Again, it is\nimportant to note that the sentence ordered today must be proportionate to the\ngravity of those offences and Mr. Sydney’s degree of responsibility.[31]A second issue which\narises as a result of these recent developments is the potential impact of the\nprior 30 day intermittent sentence on the possibility of the court ordering a\nconditional sentence order. This issue relates to the interpretation and\ncontext of ordering intermittent sentences under section 732 of the Code and\nwhether or not a subsequent conditional sentence order has the effect of\ncollapsing an intermittent sentence into a straight time period of\nincarceration in a custodial facility. This issue was addressed in the case of R.\nv. Middleton, 2009 SCC 21 (CanLii) (CanLII) where the court held that imposing a\nconditional sentence of more than 90 days cannot render illegal the unexpired\nintermittent sentence imposed on the same offender for a different offence. The\nCourt also noted that it is irrelevant whether the sentence to be served on an\nintermittent basis preceded or followed the conditional sentence order. Since\neach type of sentence has its own specific purpose, intermittent and\nconditional sentences can be effectively combined to take advantage of their\ncomplementary purposes: see Middleton, supra, para’s 45-53.[32]After having considered\nthe Middleton decision, supra, I am satisfied that one of the\nsentencing options that is still available is the imposition of a conditional\nsentence order to be served in the community when Mr. Sydney is not serving his\nintermittent sentence of imprisonment. However, I also note that if I were to\norder an intermittent sentence, it would have to be combined with the 30 day\nsentence for the s.145 (3) Criminal Code which was made on\nSeptember 13, 2012. If the combined sentence exceeded the 90 day limit imposed\nby Parliament in section 732(1) of the Code, that aggregate sentence\nwould be collapsed to a sentence to be served on a straight time basis.ANALYSIS:[33]At the outset of my\nanalysis to determine a fit and proper sentence in the context of a spousal\nassault, it bears noting that domestic violence is a serious matter and,\ngenerally speaking, a sentence for a spousal assault must impress upon the\noffender and others that specific and general deterrence as well as\ndenunciation of this unlawful conduct must be the paramount considerations.[34]As pointed out by the\nOntario Court of Appeal in R. v. Inwood, [1989] O.J. No. 428 (OCA),\n“domestic assaults are not private matters, and spouses are entitled to\nprotection from violence, just as much as strangers. This does not mean that in\nevery instance of domestic violence a custodial term should be imposed, but\nthat it should be normal where significant bodily harm has been inflicted, in\norder to repudiate and denounce such conduct.”[35]In R. v. Bates (2000),\n2000 CanLII 5759 (ON CA), 146 CCC (3rd) 321 (Ont. C.A.), the Court observed that the\nprinciples they expressed in Inwood remained equally applicable\nat that time and that courts have repeatedly recognized that offences of\ndomestic violence are rarely isolated incidents. The victim is often subjected\nnot only to continuing abuse, both physical and emotional, but also experiences\nperpetual fear of the offender. In fact, the principles established in those\ndecisions are now statutorily recognized in section 718.2(a)(ii) of the Criminal\nCode.[36]Of course, in any\nsentencing decision, other sentencing principles require the court imposing a\nsentence to also take into account any relevant aggravating or mitigating\ncircumstances relating to the offence or to the offender: see section 718.2(a)\nof the Code. In this case, I find that there are several aggravating\nfactors to consider:a)Mr. Sydney assaulted\nhis common-law partner in her home;b)The assault was\ncommitted in the presence of their 3-year-old child;c)Mr. Sydney has a recent\nand related conviction for spousal assault involving Ms. Harris;d)At the time of the\nassault, Mr. Sydney was subject to terms of a probation order which prohibited\nhim from going to the residence of Ms. Harris; ande)The statutory\naggravating factors of abuse of a common-law partner and abuse of a position of\ntrust in relation to the victim found in section 718.2(a) (ii) and (iii) of the\nCriminal Code.[37]I also find that there\nare several mitigating factors to consider:a)Mr. Sydney entered an\nearly guilty plea;b)He recognized the\neffect that his misuse of alcohol had on his conduct and has taken steps on his\nown to stop drinking alcohol altogether;c)Mr. Sydney has taken\nand completed the “New Start” program for anger management in the context of\ndomestic relationships;d)He has accepted full\nresponsibility for the offence, is remorseful and wishes to apologize to Ms.\nHarris for his completely unacceptable behavior;e)He has been steadily\nemployed over the years and has recently taken steps to earn an apprenticeship\ncertificate as a chef and has provided child support to Ms. Harris on a\nvoluntary basis;f)Mr. Sydney has been\nunder restrictive terms of a Recognizance since October 25, 2010 which required\nhim to remain in his residence subject to a curfew between the hours of 10 PM\nand 6 AM, 7 days a week, subject to very limited exceptions. There were no\nbreaches of that Recognizance known to counsel at the time of the submissions\nof counsel, however, on September 13, 2012, Mr. Sydney pled guilty to breaching\nthe curfew condition on September 7, 2012;g)The presentence report\nwas generally positive and noted Mr. Sydney’s troubled upbringing, suffering\nphysical abuse at the hands of his father and being placed in several foster\nhomes.[38]In all sentencing\ndecisions, determining a fit and proper sentence is highly contextual and is\nnecessarily an individualized process which depends upon the circumstances of\nthe offence and the particular circumstances of the specific offender. On this\npoint, the Supreme Court of Canada stated, in R. v. M. (C.A.), 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] 1\nSCR 500 at paras. 91 and 92, that the determination of a just and appropriate sentence requires the trial\njudge to do a careful balancing of the societal goals of sentencing against the\nmoral blameworthiness of the offender and the gravity of the offence while at\nthe same time taking into account the victim or victims and the needs and\ncurrent conditions in the community.[39]I agree with both\ncounsel that denunciation of the unlawful conduct and specific and general\ndeterrence are important purposes and principles of sentencing in section 718\nof the Code which must be considered in the context of domestic\nviolence. In this case, given the circumstances of the offence and this particular\noffender, I find that my decision must also focus on sentencing purposes and\nprinciples which are focused on rehabilitating Mr. Sydney, promoting a sense of\nresponsibility in him and acknowledging the harm done to the victim.[40]In the sentencing\ndecision, it is also important for the court to consider the fundamental\nprinciple in sentencing expressed in section 718.1 of the Code which reminds\njudges that the sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence\nand the degree of responsibility of the offender. In this case, given the\nnature of the assault and injuries suffered by Ms. Harris, I find that the\ngravity of the offence is toward the lower end of a continuum of assaults.\nThere was no evidence in this case that the assault was a prolonged attack, nor\nwas there any evidence that the assault caused any significant or long-standing\nphysical injuries to the victim. Furthermore, I have no evidence that this\nassault was one incident in a pattern of abuse of Ms. Harris which continued\nover an extended period of time.[41]In looking at other\nprinciples and purposes of sentencing found in section 718.2 of the Code,\nI am also required to consider all available sanctions other than imprisonment\nthat are reasonable in the circumstances and not to deprive the offender of his\nliberty if a less restrictive sanction is appropriate in all the circumstances\nof the case.[42]Defence counsel has\nsubmitted that it would be appropriate to order Mr. Sydney to be subject to the\nterms of a conditional sentence order. In R. v. Proulx, 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), [2000] 1 SCR 61,\nChief Justice Lamer said at paragraph 102 that incarceration will usually\nprovide more denunciation than a conditional sentence, but a conditional\nsentence can still provide a significant amount of denunciation. This is\nparticularly so when onerous conditions are imposed and the duration of the\nconditional sentence is extended beyond the duration of the jail sentence that\nwould ordinarily have been imposed in the circumstances. The Chief Justice also\nexpressed similar remarks with respect to issue of deterrence and conditional\nsentence orders: see Proulx, supra, at para.107.[43]Pursuant to section\n742.1 of the Criminal Code, the court must first conclude that a\nconditional sentence order is an available sanction, and if so, then the court\nmust go on to consider whether it is an appropriate sanction. This latter\nconsideration requires the court to be satisfied that the service of the\nsentence in the community would not endanger the safety of the community and\nwould be consistent with the fundamental purposes and principles of sentencing\nset out in section 718 to 718.2 of the Code.[44]In this case, I\nfind that a conditional sentence order is an available sanction which may be\nimposed by the court under section 742.1 of the Criminal Code as\nthere is no maximum term of imprisonment or minimum term of imprisonment which\nwould preclude the court from making a conditional sentence order of\nimprisonment to be served in the community. Furthermore, I conclude that a\nconditional sentence order is an available sanction since I find that an\nappropriate sentence, in all the circumstances of this case, would not result\nin a federal term of incarceration, but at the same time, it would not be a fit\nand proper sentence to suspend passing sentence and order Mr. Sydney to serve a\nperiod on probation.[45]Having considered all\nof the purposes and principles of sentencing that ought to be considered in all\nof the circumstances of this case and also considering all of the aggravating\nand mitigating factors that are present in this case, I find that a conditional\nsentence of imprisonment provides a significant amount of denunciation and with\nthe terms and conditions to be imposed, will also provide a significant level\nof specific and general deterrence. Put another way, I am not satisfied that,\nafter having considered all of the circumstances of the offence and the\nspecific offender, that specific deterrence of Mr. Sydney and denunciation of\nhis unlawful conduct requires his separation from society through incarceration\nin a custodial facility. As such, I find that a conditional sentence order, in\nall the circumstances of this case, is consistent with the fundamental purposes\nand principles of sentencing set out in section 718 to 718.2 of the Code.[46]Once the court concludes\nthat a conditional sentence order would be consistent with the fundamental\npurpose and principles of sentencing, then the court must also determine\nwhether it would be appropriate to serve the sentence in the community and\nwhether it would endanger the safety of the community. In Proulx, supra,\nthe Supreme Court of Canada concluded that this issue would require an analysis\nof the risk of reoffending and the gravity of the damage that could ensue\nshould the offender re-offend, including the risk of economic harm. This\nanalysis must be done on a case-by-case basis, but relevant factors would\ninclude the nature and circumstances of the offence, the relationship of the\naccused to the victim, the personal circumstances of the offender (including\nhis or her prior criminal record, mental state and family situation), the\nconduct of the offender following the commission of the offence and the danger\nthat the offender might pose in the community: See Angelillo, supra,\nat para. 35.[47]Looking at those\nfactors in assessing the issue of the safety of the community, these charges\nrelate to an incident between Mr. Sydney and his former common-law partner, Ms.\nHarris. The common-law relationship between Mr. Sydney and Ms. Harris has\nended; they have not lived together for almost 2 years. Mr. Sydney had complied,\nwithout incident until a few days ago, with the term in the Recognizance not to\nhave any direct or indirect communication with her, except as provided in that\norder. Mr. Sydney has recently become involved in a common-law relationship\nwith another woman and the Recognizance was varied on September 11, 2012 to\nallow him to reside at her house. Mr. Sydney has successfully completed the\n“New Start” anger management program in the context of domestic violence and\nhas stopped drinking alcohol, both of which played a significant role in the\ncircumstances of the offences before the court.[48]In considering the risk\nof Mr. Sydney re-offending or failing to comply with the court’s order, it has\nbeen pointed out that there was one prior breach of probation and that today’s\nsentence also includes a further breach of probation. I am satisfied that Mr.\nSydney’s compliance with the restrictive terms of the Recognizance for a period\nof almost 2 years shows that he has the ability to fully comply with court\norders. However, for some unknown reason, after almost 2 years of compliance\nwith the restrictive terms of a curfew condition contained in his Recognizance,\nMr. Sydney has admitted that he breached the curfew condition.[49]As indicated above, I\nfind that it is appropriate for me to consider the recent sentence for the\ncurfew violation in the context of considering the offender’s character and\nreputation as well as the risk of reoffending. The fact that the breach of the\nRecognizance occurred just before the court’s sentencing decision in this\nmatter, causes me to further reflect on the issue of whether Mr. Sydney has the\nmotivation and ability to fully comply with a conditional sentence order. While\nI am concerned that Mr. Sydney has recently breached the terms of a court\norder, I do note that in breaching the terms of the Recognizance, Mr. Sydney’s\nactions did not involve the commission of any other substantive criminal\noffences in relation to Ms. Harris or for that matter any other members of the\ncommunity. Finally, I must remember that Mr. Sydney has been punished for that\nbreach of the Recognizance and that today’s sentencing decision must be\nproportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of\nthis offender and to not punish Mr. Sydney again for that other offence.[50]During her submissions,\nDefence counsel stated that the 2 days that Mr. Sydney spent in custody until\nbeing released under the terms of the Recognizance had a salutary effect on\nhim. Mr. Sydney had not been incarcerated prior to that time and I expect that\nthe 2 days spent on remand did have a salutary effect. I am also satisfied that\nthe intermittent sentence for the breach of the Recognizance will provide, as\nthe Supreme Court of Canada phrased it in Middleton, supra, at\npara. 45, a balance between the denunciatory and deterrent functions of “real\njail time” and the rehabilitative functions of preserving the offender’s\nemployment, family relationships and responsibilities and obligations to the\ncommunity. Furthermore, I am satisfied that the recent imposition of the\nintermittent sentence will also have a salutary effect on Mr. Sydney.[51]I find that all of these\nfactors point favorably to my conclusion that the safety of the community would\nnot be endangered by him serving the sentence of imprisonment in the community.[52]Having concluded that a\nconditional sentence order to be served in the community is available and that\nit is also an appropriate disposition which is consistent with the fundamental\npurpose and principles of sentencing and would not endanger the safety of the\ncommunity, I hereby order Mr. Sydney to be subject to a conditional sentence\norder of imprisonment in the community for a period of 8 months, with the 1st\n4 months of that order to be served under terms of house arrest and the final 4\nmonths being served under a curfew condition from 11:59 PM to 6 AM, 7 days per\nweek, subject to certain exceptions. Following the 8 months conditional\nsentence order, Mr. Sydney will be subject to a probation order for the next 16\nmonths.[53]The eight-month\nconditional sentence order of imprisonment will be broken down as follows: 6\nmonths on the assault charge, 2 months consecutive for the uttering threats\ncharge and 2 months concurrent for the breach of the probation charge. The\nperiod of probation will attach to the assault and threats charge[54]Mr. Sydney will be\nrequired to report to the sentence supervisor today and thereafter as directed\nby the sentence supervisor or probation officer. The conditional sentence order\nof imprisonment in the community will commence at 6 PM today.[55]During the Conditional\nSentence Order and the period of probation that follows, will also be subject\nto the statutory conditions keep the peace and be of good behavior, appear\nbefore the court as and when required to do so by the court and notify the\ncourt, probation officer or supervisor, in advance, of any change of name,\naddress, employment or occupation.[56]While Mr. Sydney is on\nhouse arrest, he will be required to remain in his residence at all times,\nsubject only to the following exceptions which allow him to be outside of his\nresidence during that period would be as follows:a)when at regularly\nscheduled employment and traveling to and from that employment by direct route;b)when dealing with\nmedical emergency or medical appointment involving him or a member of his\nhousehold and traveling to and from it by direct route;c)when attending a\nscheduled appointment with your lawyer or probation officer and traveling to\nand from the appointment by a direct route;d)when attending court at\na scheduled appearance or under subpoena and traveling to and from court by a\ndirect route;e)when attending a\ncounseling appointment, treatment program or meeting such as the Alcoholics\nAnonymous, at the direction of and with permission of your probation officer\nand traveling to and from that appointment program or meeting by a direct\nroute;f)with the prior written\napproval of your sentence supervisor;g)for not more than 4\nhours per week for the purpose of attending to your personal needs with the\nprior approval of the sentence supervisor;[57]During the curfew period\nwhich requires you to remain in your residence between the hours of 11:59 PM\nand 6:00 AM the following day, 7 days per week, the only exception would be when\nyou are dealing with a medical emergency involving you or member of your\nhousehold and traveling to and from it by a direct route.[58]Finally, you are\nrequired to prove compliance with the house arrest and curfew conditions by\npresenting yourself at the entrance to your residence should a sentence\nsupervisor or a peace officer attend there to check compliance.[59]During the conditional\nsentence order you are not to possess take or consume any alcohol or\nintoxicating substances and you are not to possess take or consume any\ncontrolled substances as defined in the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act\nexcept in accordance with a physician’s prescription for you or a legal\nauthorization;[60]During both the\nConditional Sentence Order and the Probation Order:a) You are not have possession of any firearm, cross-bow, prohibited\nweapon, restricted weapon, prohibited device, ammunition or explosive\nsubstance;b)You are not to have any direct or indirect contact or communication\nwith Ms. Pamela Harris except through a lawyer or in accordance with the\nwritten separation agreement or court order for access to a child or children\nor where the contact is initiated by her and is subject to her express consent\nwhich may be withdrawn at any time;c)You are not to be on or within 50 meters of the premises known as any\nresidence or place of employment of Pamela Harris, except on those occasions as\nmay be authorized by a court of competent jurisdiction for arranging for access\nto your son or Ms. Harris has contacted you or a 3rd party to make\narrangements for access to your son;d)You are to attend for substance abuse assessment and counseling as\ndirected by the probation officer, assessment and counseling in anger\nmanagement as directed by your probation officer and to attend for assessment\nand counseling for violence intervention and prevention program as directed by\nthe probation officer and in particular the spousal or partner related program.\nFinally, you are to attend for assessment, counseling or any program as\ndirected by the probation officer and participate in and cooperate with any\nassessment, counseling or any program that may be directed by the probation\nofficer.[61]In addition to the foregoing orders, there will also be a section\n110 Criminal Code order prohibiting you from possessing any\nfirearms, crossbow, prohibited weapon, restricted weapon, prohibited device,\nammunition, prohibited ammunition or explosives substance, for a period of 5\nyears.[62]I am also making an order under section 487.051 of the Criminal\nCode which will require you to provide a sample of your DNA.[63]Finally, given the fact that you have recently started a new job and have just\nlost that employment, you are paying child support to Ms. Harris and will, in\nall likelihood, be assisting your current partner with her household expenses,\nI find that it would be an undue hardship to impose the victim fine surcharge\nin the circumstances of this case. As such, I will waive the imposition of the\nVictim Fine Surcharge on all of the charges that were before the court today\nfor sentencing."}

Moore of the Ontario Court of Justice, dated January 29, 2010.Tulloch\nJ.A.:A.OVERVIEW[1]The appellant pleaded guilty to five\nfirearms-related offences, including possession of a restricted firearm with\nammunition, contrary to s. 95(1) of the Criminal Code and\nbreach of a firearms prohibition order. He received a global sentence of nine\nand one-half years.[2]The appellant sought leave to appeal his\nsentence. He argued that under the applicable provisions of the Youth\nCriminal Justice Act, S.C. 2002, c. 1 (“YCJA”), he should not have been\ntreated as a second or subsequent offender for the purpose of determining the\napplicable mandatory minimum penalty under s. 95(2) of the Criminal Code.[3]At the end of oral argument, the court dismissed\nthe appeal indicating:The sentence, while lengthy, regardless of whether\nthis conviction triggered the mandatory minimum sentence for subsequent\nconvictions, was not “demonstrably unfit”.We cannot interfere. We will release reasons\nat a later date addressing the proper interpretation of the relevant provisions\nof the YCJA.B.the relevant facts[4]In November 2007, the appellant was found guilty\nof a number of offences, including possession of a restricted firearm with\nammunition contrary to s. 95(1) of the Criminal Code. He was sentenced\nas a youth under the YCJA and received a short custodial sentence, a period of\nprobation and a firearms prohibition.[5]In February 2009, police received information\nthat a small group of men in a vehicle parked in the Regent Park neighbourhood\nof Toronto were in possession of a restricted firearm. Officers approached the\nvehicle to investigate. Suddenly, a door to the car flung open and the appellant\nexited the vehicle and fled.[6]The officers gave chase and observed the\nappellant throw an object into a nearby dumpster as he ran. After a brief search\nof the dumpster, police discovered that the object was in fact a .45-calibre\nsemi-automatic firearm with capacity for 12 rounds. Eleven out of the 12 rounds\nin the handgun were chambered and ready to fire. The serial number on the\nfirearm had been scratched out and it was later found to have been stolen in\nthe United States and illegally brought to Canada.[7]Shortly after the discovery of the handgun,\npolice dogs located the appellant nearby. The appellant was taken to the police\nstation where he provided a statement and admitted possession of the handgun\nrecovered from the dumpster. He was charged with, inter alia,\npossession of a restricted firearm with ammunition.[8]In October 2009, the appellant pleaded guilty to\nthe offences charged and was remanded for sentencing.[9]In January 2010, the sentencing judge imposed a\nglobal sentence of nine and one-half years. At the sentencing hearing, Crown\ncounsel, defence counsel and the sentencing judge agreed that the appellant’s\nfinding of guilt under the YCJA in 2007 on a charge under s. 95(1) made this\nconviction under s. 95(1)(a) a “second or subsequent offence” for the purposes\nof determining the applicable mandatory minimum under s. 95(2).C.ANALYSIS(1) The Operation of the Criminal Code Provisions[10]Persons, like the appellant, convicted under s.\n95(1) are subject to minimum penalties. In the case of a first offence, the\nminimum penalty is three years, and in the case of second or subsequent\noffences, the minimum penalty is five years: s. 95(2) of the Criminal Code.\nAn offence is a “second or subsequent offence” if within the 10 years prior to\nthe conviction for which the accused is being sentenced, he or she was\nconvicted of any of the offences enumerated in s. 84(5). Section 95(1) is one\nof the enumerated offences. Consequently, and setting aside the YCJA provisions\nfor the moment, the appellant’s conviction under s. 95(1) in November 2007 made\nthis conviction on a s. 95(1) charge a “second or subsequent offence” and\ntriggered the five-year minimum penalty in s. 95(2).(2) The applicable YCJA provisions[11]The appellant submits that because he was found\nguilty under the YCJA for his previous s. 95(1) offence, this s. 95(1)\nconviction does not constitute a “second or subsequent offence” for the purpose\nof determining the applicable minimum penalty. The appellant relies on s. 82(4)\nof the YCJA:Finding of guilt not a previous\nconviction(4) A finding of guilt under this\nAct is not a previous conviction for the purposes of any offence under any Act\nof Parliament for which a greater punishment is prescribed by reason of\nprevious convictions, except for(a) [Repealed](b) the purpose of determining\nthe adult sentence to be imposed.[12]Standing alone, s. 82(4) supports the\nappellant’s position. However, that subsection is subject to s. 119(9)(a):Application of usual rules(9) If, during the period of access\nto a record under any of paragraphs (2)(g) to (j), the young person is\nconvicted of an offence committed when he or she is an adult,(a) section 82 (effect of absolute\ndischarge or termination of youth sentence) does not apply to the young person\nin respect of the offence for which the record is kept under sections 114 to\n116;[13]The term “period of access” is defined in s.\n119(2). For the appellant’s purposes, the relevant definition appears in s.\n119(2)(h):Period of access(2) The period of access referred to\nin subsection (1) is…(h) subject to paragraphs (i) and\n(j) and subsection (9), if the young person is found guilty of the offence and\nit is an indictable offence, the period ending five years after the youth\nsentence imposed in respect of the offence has been completed;[14]The appellant was convicted of an indictable\noffence under the YCJA in November 2007. Consequently, under s. 119(2)(h), the\nperiod of access ended five years after the conviction in November 2007. The\nappellant’s subsequent convictions, which are the subject of this appeal, were\nentered in February 2009, well within the access period.(3) Resolving the interpretation issue[15]The appellant submits that s. 119(9)(a) applies\nonly to s. 82(1). Therefore, regardless of the fact that this s. 95(1) conviction\nwas well within the five-year access period, s. 82(4) applies and the\nappellant’s finding of guilt as a youth under s. 95(1) is not a previous conviction.\nAccordingly, this s. 95(1) conviction is the appellant’s first such offence and\nhe is subject to the three-year mandatory minimum sentence in s. 95(2).[16]The respondent, on the other hand, contends that\nthe application of s. 82(4) is also limited by the operation of s. 119(9)(a).\nAccordingly, the appellant is well within the “period of access” defined in s.\n119(2) and the enhanced five-year mandatory minimum in s. 95(2) for second or\nsubsequent offenders should apply.[17]I agree with the respondent. In Rizzo \u0026\nRizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), 1998 CanLII 837 (SCC), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at para. 21, the Supreme Court of\nCanada held that statutory interpretation must begin with the words of the\nrelevant statutory provisions, read in their entire context and in their\ngrammatical and ordinary sense and interpreted harmoniously with the scheme and\nthe object of the legislation and with Parliament’s intention.[18]The relevant portion of section 119(9)(a) provides\nthat “[s]ection 82 (effect of absolute discharge or termination of youth\nsentence) does not apply”. On a plain reading, this can only mean that the protection\nof s. 82, and that of each of its subsections, is extinguished in the event\nthat an adult is convicted of an offence within the period of access applicable\nto his or her youth record. There is no indication on the face of the\nlegislation why the application of s. 119(9)(a) would be restricted to s.\n82(1).[19]The appellant points to the words “effect of\nabsolute discharge or termination of youth sentence” in parentheses in s.\n119(9)(a) as evidence that it should only apply to s. 82(1). However, s. 2(3)\nof the YCJA demonstrates that the words in parentheses are merely a matter of\nconvenience and are to hold no interpretive weight:Descriptive cross-references(3) If, in any provision of this\nAct, a reference to another provision of this Act or a provision of any other\nAct is followed by words in parentheses that are or purport to be descriptive\nof the subject-matter of the provision referred to, those words form no\npart of the provision in which they occur but are inserted for convenience of\nreference only. [Emphasis added.][20]The appellant also referred the court to s.\n119(9)(c), which deems the finding of guilt as a young person to be a\nconviction for the purposes of Criminal Records Act, R.S.C. 1985, c.\nC-47 if a person with a youth record is convicted of an offence during the\naccess period as an adult. He submits that, had Parliament intended all\nfindings of guilt to be treated as previous convictions for all statutes, it\nwould not have included the reference to the Criminal Records Act.[21]I disagree. As a whole, s. 119(9) concerns the\nconsequences that flow from an individual having been convicted of an offence\nas an adult during the relevant period of access. Section 119(9)(c) addresses\nthe ramifications of the Criminal Records Act where an offence is\ncommitted during the access period. Section 119(9)(c) does not purport to speak\nto the effects of s. 82 and the impact on those effects of a conviction during\nthe access period. Regardless of whether the language in s. 119(9)(c) was\ngeneral enough to encompass the effect of a conviction within the access period\nfor all purposes, s. 119(9)(a) would still be necessary to nullify the\noperation of the general rule in s. 82(4). Therefore, the specific reference to\nthe Criminal Records Act in s. 119(9)(c) is necessary.[22]Furthermore, the interpretation of ss. 82 and\n119(9)(a) that I accept accords with the objectives of the YCJA. These\nobjectives can be found in the preamble to the YCJA. While the preamble has a\nbroad and general compass, it also “fosters responsibility and ensures\naccountability through meaningful consequences and effective rehabilitation and\nreintegration”. Effective rehabilitation and reintegration require that young\npersons are given an opportunity to move on with their life and put their\ninteraction with the criminal justice system behind them. However, a balance\nmust be struck: strings must be attached when providing young persons with such\nan opportunity.[23]This interpretation has also been discussed in\nthe academic literature. In Nicholas Bala and Sanjeev Anand’s Youth\nCriminal Justice Law, 3rd ed. (Toronto: Irwin Law, 2012), at pp. 482-483,\nthe authors comment on the general treatment of youth records under the YCJA:The [YCJA] defines a period during which there\ncan be access to a record by specified persons. After that statutory period, in\ngeneral there can be no access to the record, and no use should be made of the\nfact that the youth was convicted of that offence. This general rule is subject\nto some statutory exceptions whose exact scope has been the subject of judicial\ncontroversy.[1]If the youth commits a further offence within\nthe statutory periods, records of earlier offences can be retained and accessed\nfor a further period of three years for a later summary offence and a further\nfive years for a later indictable offence. [Footnote added.][24]There is also support for this interpretation at\nthe trial level in Ontario. In Elliston, Aston J. pronounced on the\nvery issue of using prior findings of guilt to support the imposition of an\nenhanced mandatory minimum sentence within the statutory access period. Aston\nJ. described it as “a reasonable and nuanced approach by Parliament in\nbalancing the need to punish recidivists without allowing offences committed\nwhen one is very young to haunt an individual in perpetuity”. Elliston\nhas since been followed in the Superior Court: see e.g. R. v. Mensah and\nSadat, 2011 ONSC 3303 (CanLII), [2011] O.J. No. 3052.[25]In my view, such an interpretation of the scheme\nfulfill’s Parliament’s purpose and realizes the YCJA’s objective of fostering\n“responsibility and ensur[ing] accountability through meaningful consequences\nand effective rehabilitation and reintegration”.[26]In addition, and although it is not required to\ndispose of this ground of appeal, I wish to comment on the role of s. 82(4)(b).\nSection 82(4)(b) provides that:Finding of guilt not a previous\nconviction(4) A finding of guilt under this\nAct is not a previous conviction for the purposes of any offence under any Act\nof Parliament for which a greater punishment is prescribed by reason of\nprevious convictions, except for…(b) the purpose of\ndetermining the adult sentence to be imposed. [Emphasis added.][27]The term “adult sentence” is defined in s. 2 of\nthe YCJA. Section 2 provides that an:“‘adult sentence’ in the case of\na young person who is found guilty of an offence, means any sentence that\ncould be imposed on an adult who has been convicted of the same offence.”\n[Emphasis added.][28]Therefore, the reference in s. 82(4)(b) to an\n“adult sentence” applies only to an adult sentence imposed on a young person\nunder the YCJA. Practically, s. 82(4)(b) would arise in cases where a court\nconcludes that a young person should be sentenced as an adult and where the\nyoung person has an earlier finding of guilt that would give rise to a greater\npunishment on sentencing.[29]That is not this case. The appellant was an\nadult at the time of his second offence under s. 95(1). As an adult, the\nearlier finding of guilt he received as a youth became an “earlier offence”\nwithin the meaning of s. 84(5) of the Criminal Code by virtue of the\ninteraction between ss. 119(9)(a) and 82 of the YCJA.D.Disposition[30]Since the appellant was found guilty for the\nearlier s. 95(1) offence in November of 2007, less than two years before his\nconvictions for the charges in the case at bar, he lost the protection of s.\n82(4) by operation of s. 119(9)(a) within the scheme set out in the YCJA and\ninterpreted in the foregoing reasons. Therefore, the finding of guilt against\nthe appellant as a young person was an “earlier offence” within the meaning of\ns. 84(5) of the Criminal Code and the applicable mandatory minimum –\non which counsel and the judge at the sentencing hearing had agreed – was five\nyears.[31]As indicated at the end of oral argument, leave\nto appeal the sentence is granted. However, the appeal is dismissed.Released:“JUN\n11 2013”“M. Tulloch J.A.”“DD”“I\nagree Doherty J.A.”“I\nagree Janet Simmons J.A.”[1]\nThere are numerous exceptions in the YCJA to this general rule. However, the\nauthors do not elaborate on this point. Nevertheless, I note that the\nauthorities placed before this court on the appeal support the interpretation I\nhave set out above: see e.g. R. v. Elliston, 2010 ONSC 6492 (CanLII), 225 C.R.R.\n(2d) 109, at para. 24. In addition, I have been unable to find any authorities\nthat would support the appellant’s position."}

No. 3 (P.C.).STATUTES\nCONSIDERED: The Criminal Code of Canada, R.S.C., 1985,JUDGMENT OF GORMAN, P.C. J.(SENTENCE)INTRODUCTION:[1]Mr. Basha has\npleaded guilty to having stolen items from two stores in Corner Brook, contrary\nto section 334(b) of the Criminal Code of Canada, R.S.C. 1985.This is\nnot the first time that Mr. Basha has done so.On October 17, 2012, I endorsed\na joint submission and granted Mr. Basha an absolute discharge for the same\noffence (see [20102] N.J. No. 345 (P.C.)).[2]The Crown\nproceeded by way of summary conviction in relation to each charge. The sole\nissue for determination is the imposition of an appropriate sentence for these\noffences.[3]Mr. Basha seeks a\nconditional discharge with probation.The Crown, based upon the prior offence\nand the presence of two new offences, opposes the granting of a discharge. The\nCrown seeks the imposition of a suspended sentence with a period of probation.[4]The granting of\nan earlier discharge does not disentitle an offender from the same leniency on\na later occasion (see R. v. Small, 2001 BCCA 91 (CanLII), [2001] B.C.J. No. 248 (C.A.), at paragraphs 12 and 13).Discharges do not contain\nany form of exclusionary rule prohibiting resort to them more than once for the\nsame offender.However, the granting of a discharge on an earlier occasion is\na significant factor weighing against the subsequent granting of a discharge,\nbut there is no absolute rule.[5]In this case, Mr.\nBasha is sixty-six years of age.He has been a contributing member of his\ncommunity and he is suffering from depression and “obsessive-compulsive\ndisorder.”The two theft offences occurred in 2013. In all of the\ncircumstances, I am satisfied that the principles of sentencing can be\nsatisfied by the imposition of a conditional discharge with a period of twelve\nmonths probation.[6]Let me explain my\nreasons for this conclusion by commencing with a review of the circumstances of\nthe offences committed by Mr. Basha.THE\nCIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENCES[7]On May 9, 2013,\nMr. Basha stole a drill from the Canadian Tire store in Corner Brook.He had\nplaced the drill into a reusable shopping bag and left the store.[8]On July 17, 2013,\nMr. Basha stole a number of items (valued at $60.00) from the Dominion store inCorner Brook.He had placed the items into a reusable shopping bag and left\nthe store.[9]All of the items\nwere recovered.[10]In R. v.\nLundrigan, 2012 NLCA 43 (CanLII), the Court of Appeal indicated that a “fit\nsentence” is one “that takes account of the circumstances of the offences and\nthe offender.”THE\nCIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENDER[11]Mr. Basha is\nsixty-six years of age.He is retired and was employed as a businessman in Corner Brook for a significant period of time.As pointed out earlier, he has one prior\nand related finding of guilt.[12]Mr. Basha has been\ndiagnosed with “obsessive-compulsive disorder.”A letter from a psychologist\nwho is treating Mr. Basha indicates that Mr. Basha suffers from “severe\nsymptoms of depression and anxiety.”The letter suggests that the prognosis\n“for treatment of [Mr. Basha’s] symptoms appears to be good.”[13]The\nevidence in relation to Mr. Basha’s diagnosis is sparse, but an offender's mental health will always be a factor in sentencing.As pointed out in R.\nv. Peters (2000), 2000 NFCA 55 (CanLII), 194 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 184\n(N.L.C.A.), \"the mental illness of an offender will often be considered a\nmitigating factor in sentencing even though it is not of the sort that would\nestablish a verdict of not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder\nat the time of the commission of the offence. The focus in sentencing such\noffenders may properly therefore be placed on mechanisms that will promote\nrehabilitation and treatment, rather than on punishment.\"However, there\nis no evidence in this case that Mr. Basha did not understand the nature of the\nthefts he committed.[14]In R. v. Branton, 2013 NLCA 61 (CanLII), the Court\nof Appeal considered the issue of imposing sentence upon an offender suffering\nfrom a mental illness. In Branton, the accused\nwas convicted of the offences of sexual assault and breach of probation. The\ntrial judge, [2012] N.J. No. 474,\nimposed a period of nine months incarceration for the sexual assault offence\nand one month incarceration, consecutive, for the breach of probation offence.\nThe Crown appealed from the sentence imposed and one of the arguments the Crown\nraised in support of its position was that the sentencing judge placed too much\nemphasis on the offender's mental illness.[15]The\nCourt of Appeal increased the sentence imposed in Branton for the\nsexual assault offence to twenty-three months imprisonment. The Court of Appeal\nconcluded that the trial judge erred in placing undue emphasis on the offender's \"mental health issues.\" At paragraph 34, the Court of Appeal indicated that the\n\"general principle articulated in Peters, 2000 NFCA 55 (CanLII), [2000] N.J. No. 287, Edmunds and Lundrigan is that\nan offender's mental health issues are a relevant factor in his or her\nsentencing when there is an established connection between an offender's mental health issues and the commission of his or her crimes.\" However, the Court of\nAppeal stated that the presence of a mental illness does not\n\"automatically justify a lighter sentence than would otherwise be\nappropriate\" (at paragraph 35):Mental illness covers a broad\nspectrum of behaviours, and it does not, by itself, absolve an offender of\nresponsibility for an offence (outside of the provisions of section 16 of the Criminal Code) or automatically justify a lighter sentence\nthan would otherwise be appropriate. When an offender has mental health issues,\ntreatment can sometimes be provided to him or her while incarcerated and if\nprobation is ordered, through the imposition of conditions directing that the\noffender seek medical assistance, participate in treatment programs, and so\nforth. Such conditions are designed to assist in the offender's rehabilitation and supervise him or her with the objective of preventing him or her from\nreoffending. These probationary conditions are \"blunt tools\", as\nCrown counsel put it in argument, and they do not guarantee results.[16]The\nCourt of Appeal concluded that though Mr. Branton's \"medical diagnoses are\npart of his personal circumstances and were therefore a legitimate\nconsideration for the sentencing judge in the same way an offender's health is often a sentencing consideration...they were overemphasized and afforded great\nweight when there was no connection established between them and the offences\ncommitted, and no recognition that Mr. Branton had been assessed and counselled\nin relation to his behaviours in the past and that despite same, he has\ncontinued to offend.\"[17]This\ndoes not mean that Mr. Basha’s diagnosis is irrelevant to sentencing.He has\ncommitted relatively minor offences and he is actively receiving treatment.THE\nPRINCIPLES OF SENTENCING[18]In R.\nv. Knott, 2012 SCC 42 (CanLII), it\nwas held that \"the purpose and principles of sentencing set out in the Criminal Code are meant to take into account the\ncorrectional imperative of sentence individualization.\"[19]Section 718 of the\nCriminal Code states that the fundamental purpose of sentencing \"is\nto contribute...to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful,\nand safe society.\"This is to be achieved by imposing sentences which\nhave, among other objectives, the objectives of:-separating\noffenders from society, where necessary;-denouncing\nunlawful conduct;-general\ndeterrence;-rehabilitation;\nand-the\npromoting of a \"sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgement\nof the harm done to victims and the community.\"[20]Section 718.2(b)\nof the Criminal Code states that \"a sentence should be similar to\nsentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in\nsimilar circumstances.\"[21]Section 718.1 of\nthe Criminal Code states that any sentence imposed must be\n\"proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of\nresponsibility of the offender.\"In R. v. Cluney, 2013 NLCA\n46 (CanLII), the Court of Appeal, at paragraph 16, indicated that the “principle of\nproportionality applies to sentencing for all criminal offences…The appropriate\nrange of sentence is related to the gravity of the offence and the moral blameworthiness\nof the offender.”[22]Section 718.2(a)\nof the Criminal Code indicates that a \"sentence should be increased\nor reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances\nrelating to the offence or the offender.\" In R. v. Briand,\n2010 NLCA 67 (CanLII), [2010] N.J. No. 339 (C.A.),\nthe Court of Appeal stressed the importance of considering an offender's personal circumstances in applying section 718.2(a) of the Criminal Code.[23]Section 718.2(d)\nstates that \"an offender should not be deprived of liberty, if less\nrestrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances\" and section\n718.2(e) states that \"all available sanctions other than imprisonment that\nare reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders,\nwith particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.\"THE POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES[24]As pointed out earlier, the\ndispute between the parties involves the propriety of a second discharge being\ngranted.THE CROWN:[25]Ms. Mouland submitted that\nbased upon the earlier offence and the presence of two similar offences, an\nadditional discharge would not be appropriate.Ms. Mouland argued that the\ngranting of a discharge would be contrary to the public interest.She\nrecommended that sentence be suspended and that Mr. Basha be placed on\nprobation.Ms. Mouland noted that the imposition of such a sentence would\nallow for Mr. Basha to seek treatment while satisfying the principle of\nspecific deterrence.[26]In support of her position,\nMs. Mouland relied upon R. v. Elsharawy (1997), 1997 CanLII 14708 (NL CA), 119 C.C.C. (3d) 565 (N.L.C.A.).Ms. Mouland pointed out that in Elsharawy the Court of Appeal indicated\nthat in order to grant an offender a discharge the offender must be “a person\nof good character, usually without previous conviction or discharge.\"MR. BASHA:[27]Mr. Martin Q.C., on behalf of\nMr. Basha, submitted that despite the earlier absolute discharge, a conditional\ndischarge should be imposed.[28]Mr. Martin Q.C. referred to\nMr. Basha’s age and circumstances in support of his position.Mr. Martin Q.C.\npointed out that these offences took place almost two years ago, without\nrepetition.He argues that Mr. Basha is a “person of good character who is\nill” and that these factors should be reflected in any sentence imposed.[29]In R. v. Ang [2014] ACTCA 17, at\nparagraph 39, it was held that there “must always be a place for the exercise\nof mercy” though this “is, of course, constrained by the requirement that a\nsentence is not manifestly inadequate.”One of the ways that the sentencing\nprinciple of restraint can be practically employed by a sentencing judge is\nthrough the use of the discharge provision in the Criminal Code.THE\nCRIMINAL CODE’S DISCHARGE PROVISION[30]The Court's authority to grant an offender a discharge is found in section 730(1) of the Criminal Code.It states as follows:Where an accused, other than an\norganization, pleads guilty to or is found guilty of an offence, other than an\noffence for which a minimum punishment is prescribed by law or an offence\npunishable by imprisonment for fourteen years or for life, the court before\nwhich the accused appears may, if it considers it to be in the best interests\nof the accused and not contrary to the public interest, instead of convicting\nthe accused, by order direct that the accused be discharged absolutely or on\nthe conditions prescribed in a probation order made under subsection 731(2).[31]Thus,\nthis provision allows the Court to refrain from entering a conviction, despite\nproof that an offence has been committed, if it is satisfied that two prerequisites\nexist.The Court must be satisfied that a discharge is (1) in the best\ninterests of the offender; and (2) not contrary to the public interest.[32]In Elsharawy,\nthe Court of Appeal indicated that the first factor \"presupposes that the\naccused is a person of good character, usually without previous conviction or\ndischarge\" and the second factor \"involves a consideration of the\nprinciple of general deterrence with attention being paid to the gravity of the\noffence, its incidence in the community, public attitudes towards it and public\nconfidence in the effective enforcement of the criminal law\" (at paragraph\n3).[33]In R. v. Sellars,\n2013 NSCA 129 (CanLII), the accused pleaded guilty to the offence of fraud.It\ninvolved “obtaining monies from her employer’s health care plan.” The accused\nrequested that a conditional discharge be granted, but the trial judge declined\nand suspended sentence and placed the accused on probation.In declining\nto grant a discharge the trial judge stated:Under these circumstances, I don’t\nthink it’s in the public interest to grant a conditional discharge.[34]The\naccused appealed from the sentence imposed.The Nova Scotia Court of\nAppeal referred to the trial judge’s comments and concluded that he had incorrectly\n“placed an obligation on the appellant to demonstrate a positive impact on the\npublic interest.”The Court of Appeal held that this was not the test for\ndetermining if a discharge should be granted.It held that the granting of a\ndischarge “does not have to be in the public interest” (at paragraph 27):A discharge does not have to be in\nthe public interest. It is available so long as the offence is not punishable\nby fourteen years, or life, it is in the best interests of the offender, and\nnot contrary to the public interest. The difference between requiring a\npositive impact on public interest and demonstrating the sentence would not be\ncontrary to the public interest is well expressed by LeBlanc J. in R. v.\nD’Eon, 2011 NSSC 330 (CanLII) where he wrote:[25] If the Sentencing Judge did\napply a test requiring that a conditional discharge be “in the public interest”\nrather than being “not contrary to the public interest,” this would be the\nwrong test. There is a substantive difference between the two phrases; the\ncorrect “not contrary” test simply means that a conditional discharge would not\nbe deleterious. It is not required to be have actual positive effect on the\npublic interest.[35]In R. v. Burke, 1996 CanLII 11083 (NL CA), [1996] N.J. No. 179\n(C.A.), the accused, a former Christian Brother, was convicted of the offence\nof assault causing bodily harm in relation to a child at the Mount Cashel Orphanage\nin 1975.He was sentenced to a period of one month imprisonment by the trial\njudge.On appeal, an absolute discharge was substituted.[36]In R. v.\nEdmunds, 2012 NLCA 26 (CanLII), [2012] N.J. No. 177 (C.A.), the accused pleaded guilty\nto one count of breach of trust by a public officer and two counts of theft.\nThe offender, who was employed as a correctional officer, stole monies from two\nprisoners. The sentencing judge imposed a conditional discharge with\ntwenty-four months of probation.The Crown appealed from the sentence imposed.[37]The Crown’s appeal\nfrom sentence was dismissed. The Newfoundland and Labrador Court of Appeal\nconcluded in Edmunds that “the Crown has not pointed the Court to\nany binding or persuasive authorities that would suggest that a conditional\ndischarge was a demonstrably unfit and clearly unreasonable sentence in these\ncircumstances.”The Court of Appeal noted, at paragraph 20, that in “some circumstances,\nevidence of particular effects on the offender will be required if the offender\nis relying on such factors.However, a sentencing judge may take judicial\nnotice of the fact that a criminal conviction will have a negative impact on a\nperson's future, whether related to employment opportunities, travel, and so\nforth.”[38]In R. v. House,\n[2012] N.J. No. 219 (C.A.), the accused was convicted of the offences of\nassault and unlawfully being in a dwelling house.In concluding that a\nconditional discharge was warranted for both offences, the Court of Appeal\nindicated that the accused is \"a promising young man who, in his twenties,\nis still maturing and developing the basis for a productive life including\nemployment and relationship opportunities and decisions\" (at paragraph\n24):As discussed in Elsharawy,\nin an assessment of whether a conditional discharge is in the best interests of\nMr. House, the first condition presupposes that the accused is a person of good\ncharacter, ordinarily with no previous criminal conviction or discharge. Based\non the above, this supposition is satisfied in this case. As to the need for\npersonal deterrence or rehabilitation, I note that Mr. House was on release,\nwith conditions, on a Promise to Appear prior to his trial, and that he\nobtained judicial interim release, again with conditions, pending determination\nof his appeal. He has been compliant with the terms of release, particularly\nthe requirement to keep the peace and be of good behaviour, for almost four\nyears. Given the nature of the offence and Mr. House's conduct since the\noffences were committed, personal deterrence and rehabilitation are not matters\nof concern. Finally, regarding adverse repercussions from a criminal\nconviction, Mr. House is a promising young man who, in his twenties, is still\nmaturing and developing the basis for a productive life including employment\nand relationship opportunities and decisions. A criminal record, where such is\nunnecessary for purposes of protection of the public, may result in roadblocks\nin terms of this development. Such a result is to be avoided provided Mr. House\nis otherwise a proper candidate for a conditional discharge.[39]As can be seen from\nthese precedents, discharges have been granted inthis Province for very\nserious offences.The circumstances in Burke, House and\nEdmunds are, for instance, more serious than what occurred here.SENTENCING PRECEDENTS-THEFT[40]The range of\nsentence for minor thefts ranges from the imposition of a discharge to\nrelatively short periods of imprisonment when the offender has a related\ncriminal record (see R. v. Prowse (1998), 1998 CanLII 18024 (NL CA), 168 Nfld. \u0026\nP.E.I.R. 289 (N.L.C.A.), R. v. C.C., [2012] N.J. No. 121 (P.C.), R.\nv. Reid, [2012] N.J. No. 164 (P.C.), R. v. Roberts,\n[2013] N.J. No. 214 (P.C.), R. v. J.B., [2013] N.J. No. 218\n(P.C.), R. v. Park, [2013] N.J. No. 244 (P.C.), R. v. Sutherland,\n[2013] N.J. No. 53 (P.C.), R. v. Durnford, [2014] N.J. No. 5 (P.C.),R. v. Courtney, [2014] N.J. No. 172 (P.C.), R. v. Bennett,\n[2014] N.J. No. 51 (P.C.), R. v. Sutherland, [2014] N.J. No. 228\n(P.C.) and R. v. Jacobs, [2015] N.J. No. 3 (P.C.)).[41]In R. v. Keeping,\n2012 NLTD(G) 57, the accused was convicted of two counts of theft.She cashed\na cheque belonging to her husband and stole $27,934.50 from a company which was\nowned by her estranged husband. She had a criminal record consisting of two thefts,\ntwo breaches of recognizance, a failure to comply with a probation order, an\nassault and an assault with a weapon.A conditional discharge and a period of six months\nprobation were imposed.[42]In R. v.\nSamson, 2015 YKCA 7 (CanLII), the accused stole $8,380.78 from her employer.The trial judge imposed a conditional discharge with probation.A Crown appeal\nfrom sentence was dismissed.ANALYSIS[43]In Branton,\nthe Court of Appeal pointed out, at paragraph 18, that “it is worth restating\nthat sentencing judges enjoy a broad discretion to craft a sentence that is\ntailored to the nature of the offence and the circumstances of the offender and\nthat a sentencing judge has the discretion to decide on the particular blend of\nsentencing goals and the weight to be given to relevant aggravating or\nmitigating factors to decide each particular case.However, this discretion is\nconstrained by statute and fettered by binding jurisprudence.”[44]In this case, Mr. Basha\ncommitted two relatively minor theft offences.Considering his age and\ncircumstances, a discharge would be an appropriate sentence.The difficulty,\nhowever, is the prior finding of guilt.As Ms. Mouland points out, this\nrequires that I consider the sentencing principle of specific deterrence.[45]There is no\nevidence in this case that the entering of a conviction will have a negative\nimpact upon Mr. Basha.It will not, for instance, result in the loss of employment\nor limit his employment prospects. However, as pointed out by the Court of\nAppeal in Edmunds: “a sentencing judge may take judicial notice\nof the fact that a criminal conviction will have a negative impact on a person's future, whether related to employment opportunities, travel, and so forth.”[46]Considering the\ntotality of the circumstances, I am satisfied that the prerequisites for the\ngranting of a discharge are present in this case.I am satisfied that based\nupon the nature of the offences; the nature of the prior finding of guilt; the\ntime period between the offences and today’s date; and Mr. Basha having sought\ntreatment, that it would not be contrary to the public interest for a\nconditional discharge to be imposed.Accordingly, Mr. Basha is sentenced to a\nconditional discharge with a period of probation of twelve months.THE TERMS OF THE PROBATION ORDER[47]In addition to the statutory\nconditions which apply, Mr. Basha must:-report to a probation officer in\nperson as required;-comply with all directions received\nfrom his probation officer;-attend all counseling or treatment\nsessions arranged by his probation officer; and-make a charitable contribution in\nthe amount of $500.00 to a food bank chosen by his probation officer. This must\nbe paid to the Provincial Court in Corner Brook within sixty days of today’s\ndate.[1]A VICTIM SURCHARGE[48]The imposition of victim\nsurcharges would not constitute an undue hardship for Mr. Basha.Thus, he must\npay a victim surcharge in the amount of $50.00 in relation to each count to theProvincial Court within thirty days of today’s date.CONCLUSION[49]For the reasons\nprovided, Mr. Basha is sentenced to a conditional discharge with twelve months\nof probation.[50]Judgment accordingly.[1]I am satisfied for the reasons provided in R. v. Penney, [2013] N.J. No. 340\n(P.C.), at paragraphs 73 to 81, that this condition is a reasonable one which\nwill allow Mr. Basha to make reparations to the community."}

Chisholm, the same judge who had taken\nhis plea back in January, 2009.After two days of hearing, Chisholm, P.C.J.\nrendered a decision now reported at 2011 NSPC 8 (CanLII)wherein he dismissed the\nappellant’s motion to withdraw his plea.Following counsels’ submissions he\naccepted their joint recommendation and sentenced the appellant to six months\nin custody, to be served under house arrest with strict conditions, together\nwith various ancillary orders, followed by two years’ probation.[8]The appellant now asks that we allow the appeal, strike the guilty plea,\nand remit the case to the Provincial Court for either a rehearing of the motion\nto withdraw his plea, or a new trial, before a different judge.[9]After carefully considering the record and counsels’ submissions we are\nunanimously of the view that the appeal ought to be dismissed.[10]In addressing the validity of the appellant’s guilty plea, and quite\napart from having to be satisfied that the plea was voluntary and unequivocal,\nJudge Chisholm was also obliged to determine whether the plea was informed by\nan awareness of the nature of the allegations as well as the effect and\nconsequences of the plea.See, for example, R. v. Nevin, 2006 NSCA 72 (CanLII),\nand R. v. Laffin, 2009 NSCA 19 (CanLII).[11]Given the appellant’s denial that he ever sexually assaulted his son and\nthat he was only attempting to teach the boy personal hygiene, Judge Chisholm\nwas required to very carefully test the appellant’s explanation and his overall\ncredibility.In that, Judge Chisholm had the benefit of a full hearing which\nincluded: detailed affidavits submitted by both the appellant and his former\ncounsel Mr. Andrew Pavey; cross-examination of the appellant and the probation\nofficer who authored the pre-sentence report; as well as comprehensive written\nand oral submissions from counsel.[12]Ultimately the judge rejected the appellant’s assertions.He noted the\ninternal inconsistencies in the appellant’s evidence, as well as the\ncontradictions between the appellant’s evidence and that of his former counsel,\nand probation officer.[13]A few brief examples will illustrate the obvious conflicts in the\nevidence.Under cross-examination at the hearing, Mr. L. denied telling the\nprobation officer, Mr. Phillip Ralph Josey, that he accepted responsibility for\nsexually assaulting his son, or expressing remorse for having done so.He said\nMr. Josey “did not understand him well” and that his expression of regret\nrelated to the break-up of the family.He said he told the probation officer\nthat he was simply repeating the same lesson on personal hygiene that he had\nonce learned from his own father.He said he was doing nothing more than “just\npassing this knowledge on to his son.”When he told the probation officer that\nhe accepted responsibility for his actions, all he meant was that he had been\ntoo harsh with the lad and had expected too much of a young child.[14]By contrast, Mr. Josey’s evidence was that he never had any difficulty\ncommunicating with Mr. L. over the course of his supervision, and that there\nhad never been any request to have an interpreter present.Mr. Josey confirmed\nthat the appellant had accepted responsibility for his actions and that when he\nhad questioned Mr. L. he was not able to offer an explanation for his\nbehaviour.Had he provided an innocent explanation, Mr. Josey said he would\nhave certainlyincluded such an account in his report.[15]In his affidavit filed in support of his motion, Mr. L. swore:[11]... Having heard my son’s allegations, I most\nseriously deny that I have touched him in any sexual part of his body, or had\nhim participate in any sexual kind of activity with me....[13]I did not understand the nature of the sexual\nallegations that were the basis of the sexual assault charge at the time that I\nentered my guilty plea.I should not have entered that plea. ...[14]I therefore ask to withdraw my guilty plea and to\nhave a trial of the allegations that my son has made against me.[16]However, on cross-examination at the hearing, Mr. L. admitted that his\nformer counsel, Mr. Pavey, had related to him the details of the\nallegations of sexual assault but that he had decided to plead guilty and\nacknowledge the facts upon which the charge was based, even though “he knew he\nwas pleading guilty to something that was not true” because “... he wanted to\nclose the case as soon as possible because he was unemployed and he was unable\nto pay his lawyer.”Mr. Pavey’s affidavit makes it clear that the appellant\n(with his translator present) was fully advised of all of the allegations and\nthe facts to be relied upon at the sentencing hearing.He was told that the\njoint submission on sentencing to be made by counsel would include a sex\noffender assessment and counselling as required as well as other standard\nancillary orders.Mr. Pavey swore that he had clear and complete instructions\nfrom his client to proceed on that basis with the plea.[17]Judge Chisholm noted that the defence chose not to cross-examine Mr.\nPavey on his affidavit.In rejecting Mr. L.’s evidence, Judge Chisholm wrote,\nin part:[51] ... The Defense position is that Mr. Pavey participated in\nconcluding a plea and sentence negotiation and the entering of a guilty plea\nknowing that the accused denied that he committed the act of sexual assault as\nalleged or any other sexual assault.For counsel to do so would be improper.The only evidence that this occurred was the evidence of Mr. [L.].The\ninterpreter who was present was not called to give evidence.Mr. [L.]'s\nevidence was not found credible by the Court.[18]It cannot be seriously suggested that the judge erred in the conduct of\nthe hearing or that his questioning of the appellant was improper or gives rise\nto an apprehension of bias.[19]We see no error in Judge\nChisholm’s recitation or treatment of the evidence; his application of the law\nto the evidence; his analysis; or his conclusion.Based on the record before\nhim, it was certainly open to the judge to conclude that Mr. L.’s assertions\nwere not credible, and that he had failed to satisfy the heavy burden of\ndemonstrating that when he entered his plea he failed to fully appreciate the\nallegations which led to the charge of sexual assault.[20]If the appellant wished to challenge the facts relied upon by the Crown,\nhe could have done so after losing the motion to withdraw his plea, and before\nproceeding to sentencing.Yet he made no attempt to put the Crown to strict\nproof of its facts.Rather, through counsel, he accepted the facts stated by\nthe Crown at the sentencing hearing as the basis for the sexual assault against\nhis son.[21]On March 16, 2011, following release of the judge’s decision, and\nwith an interpreter present, counsel raised a factual error with the trial\njudge.Counsel for the appellant advised the judge that the reference in his\nreasons to Mr. L’s convictions for assaulting his son and for uttering threats\nagainst his estranged wife, were mistaken (the references had apparently been\nreversed).The judge acknowledged the error and edited his decision to reflect\nthe correction noting in open court on the record,\nthat “It would not affect my overall view with respect to Mr. [L.]’s evidence\nand the Court’s conclusion on the motion.”We accept that the judge’s error\nwas minor, easily and appropriately corrected, and of no consequence to the\noutcome, or the merits of this appeal.[22]In conclusion, the appellant’s credibility was an issue Judge\nChisholm had to decide.He did so fairly with\nreasons that are clear, cogent and fully supported on the record.Judge\nChisholm did not miss, mistreat, or misapprehend the evidence.He correctly\napplied the law.There was no miscarriage of justice.The appeal is\ndismissed.Saunders,\nJ.A.Concurred in:Hamilton,\nJ.A.Beveridge,\nJ.A."}

G.M.S., 2004 NLSCTD 141Date: 2004-07-15Docket: 2004 06T 0025Between:G.M.S, (Appellant)andHer Majesty The Queen (Respondent)Handrigan, J.Counsel:Marcus Evans, for\nthe appellant;R. Neil Smith and Terry D. White, for\nthe respondent.[1]Handrigan, J.: The Appellant appeared in Provincial Court of\nNewfoundland and Labrador sitting as a Youth Justice Court at Grand Bank, NL on\nFebruary 11, 2004. He was sentenced on that date for three offences to which he\nhad pled guilty: one breach of s. 4(1) of the Controlled Drugs and\nSubstances Act[1]\nand two breaches of s. 137 of the Youth Criminal\nJustice Act[2].[2]The Youth Justice Court Judge sentenced the Appellant to six\nmonths closed custody for each of the offences to be served concurrently. He\nalso ordered that the Appellant be supervised in the community for 90 days\nafter the custodial sentences ended. Finally, he placed the Appellant on\nsupervised probation for 12 months, to begin after the expiration of the\ncommunity supervision order.[3]The Appellant appeals the custodial and supervision\nparts of his sentence. His primary argument is that the sentencing judge\nwas not authorized by law to impose a custodial sentence, but he also contends\nthat the sentences did not comply with sentencing principles for young persons.BackgroundThe Appellant[4]The Appellant is 18 years old. He was born on June 8, 1986. His\nparents are separated and he lives with his mother. The Appellant is a Level\nIII student who is capable academically and should graduate high school this\nyear. He intends to enroll in a post-secondary educational programme in fall\n2004 to qualify to work in a trade.[5]The Appellant’s family environment is unstable and lacks the\nstructure and control that he requires. His friends are older than he is and\nare not a positive influence in his life. The Appellant uses alcohol and\nmarijuana regularly and does not appear to be concerned about their effects on\nhim, despite being hospitalized twice because of severe intoxication.[6]The Appellant has a record of prior convictions. He appeared in\nYouth Court[3]\nat Grand Bank on February 14, 2001 and was placed on 12 months’ unsupervised\nprobation for a breach of s. 70(2) of the Liquor Control Act[4].\nHe appeared in the Youth Justice Court[5]\nagain on October 1,2003 and was placed on supervised probation for 12 months\nand ordered to perform 40 hours of community services.The Offences[7]The Appellant breached the probation order that was imposed on\nhim in October, 2003 by being under the influence of alcohol on November 8,\n2003, just a little over a month after the order was made. One of the\nconditions contained in that probation order said that he was not to\n“...possess, use or consume alcohol or nonprescription drugs”. He was charged\nwith a breach of s. 137 of the Youth Criminal Justice\nAct and pled guilty on December 17, 2003. A pre-sentence report was ordered\nand the matter was adjourned to February 11, 2004.[8]The Appellant was awaiting sentencing for that offence when he\nwas found in possession of a quantity of marihuana on January 12, 2004. This\nresulted in a further charge under s. 137 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act for\na breach of the same condition in the October 1,2003 probation order, as well\nas a substantive charge under s. 4(1) of the Controlled\nDrugs and Substances Act. The Appellant pled guilty to the two new charges\non February 11, 2004 and was sentenced for all three offences.The Sentences[9]The Youth Justice Court Judge who sentenced the Appellant\nacknowledged having read the pre-sentence report he had ordered on December 17,\n2003. He focused on the difficulties the Appellant was having with the use of\nalcohol and drugs as related in the report, noting that it was “not\nparticularly positive”[6].\nHe summarized his reasons for sentence this way:“Now I’m aware of the principles set out in the Youth\nCriminal Justice Act and the primary concern that I have today is Mr. S’s rehabilitation. To some lesser extent I’m concerned about\ngeneral deterrence, but it doesn’t really play a large part of my thinking this\nmorning, but as I say, I’m primarily concerned about Mr. S. and his future. And\nI’ve concluded, with respect to counsel, that a period of closed custody is\nnecessary before Mr. S. self de-structs.”The Appeal[10]This appeal focuses on whether the Youth Justice Court Judge was\nauthorized to impose custody on the Appellant. The Appellant contends that he\nwas limited by para. 39(1)(b) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act to\nnon-custodial sentences. The Appellant also argued that the Youth Justice Court\nJudge should not have imposed custody on him even if he was authorized by the Act.\nHe says generally that the custody of the Youth Justice Court Judge imposed\nwas more onerous than was necessary to achieve the objectives of sentencing\nyoung persons. He further contends, in a more particular way, that his\nrehabilitation and reform, which were of primary concern to the sentencing\nJustice, could have been achieved by a remedy less restrictive than closed\ncustody. He cites open custody or supervised probation as alternative sanctions\navailable to the Justice.[11]Paragraph 39(1 )(b) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act provides\nthat the “...youth justice court shall not commit a young person to\ncustody...unless...the young person has failed to comply with non-custodial\nsentences...” The Appellant focuses on the plurality of the word “sentences” in\nthat paragraph. He argues that a young person can only be given a custodial\nsentence under para. 39(1 )(b) if he has failed to comply with more than one\nnon-custodial sentence. He goes farther than that and says that a custodial\nsentence is not authorized under the paragraph even where the young person has\nmore than one failure to comply with a single non-custodial sentence.[12]The Youth Justice Court Judge gave the Appellant supervised\nprobation in October, 2003. The Appellant failed to comply with a condition of\nthat non-custodial sentence [probation] that he was not to “...possess, use or\nconsume alcohol or non-prescription drugs” when he drank on November 8, 2003\nand had possession of marijuana on January 12, 2004. Both failures to comply\nrelated to the same probation order. The Appellant has never failed to comply\nwith another probation order, although he received unsupervised probation on\nFebruary 14, 2001.[13]The Appellant says that he cannot be sentenced to custody because\nhe has failed to comply with a single non-custodial sentence and not with\n“non-custodial sentences”, even though he did so twice. He argues that the\nYouth Justice Court Judge who sentenced him could only have imposed custody if\nhe had failed to comply with at least two non-custodial sentences. His argument\nmay be summarized this way: More than one failure to comply with a single\nnon-custodial sentence is not the same thing as more than one failure to comply\nwith more than one non-custodial sentence. Only the latter is contemplated by\npara. 39(1 )(b) of the Act.The LawLegislation[14]The Youth Criminal Justice Act came into effect on April\n1, 2003. It replaced the Young Offenders Act and made significant\nchanges to how young persons were dealt with in the criminal justice system.\nThe Youth Criminal Justice Act is clear that custody may only be imposed\non young persons as a last resort. The legislation is replete with this view,\nwhether it is stated directly or only inferentially. I will review the\nprocedural and substantive limitations imposed by the Act on the use of\ncustody as part of the framework in which the words “non-custodial sentences”\nused in para. 39(1)(b) are interpreted.[15]A recital in the Preamble to the Act says that\n“...Canadian society should have a youth criminal justice system that...reduces\nthe over-reliance on incarceration for non-violent persons”. Sub-paragraph\n3(l)(b)(i) says that it is one of the principles of the Act that the\n“...criminal justice system\nmust be separate from that of adults and emphasize...rehabilitation and\nreintegration...”[16]This is one of the mandatory principles that a Youth Justice Court must apply when determining sentences: “...all available sanctions other\nthan custody that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for\nall young persons...”[7].\nElsewhere the Act says that the sanction imposed must be the “least\nrestrictive sentence” that promotes accountability in the young person and rehabilitation\nand reintegration into society, while protecting the public[8].[17]Section 39 of the Act places the most severe limitations\non the Youth Justice Court that is inclined to impose custodial sentences on\nyoung persons. These are the only circumstances in which the Youth Justice\nCourt has any authority to impose custody: “A youth justice court shall not\ncommit a young person to custody unless...” he has committed a violent\noffence, has failed to comply with non-custodial sentences, has committed an\nindictable offence for which an adult would be liable to more than two years in\nprison and has a history that indicates a pattern of findings of guilt,\nor is an exceptional case, but then only if he has committed an indictable\noffence with aggravating circumstances[9].\n(Underlining mine)[18]If one or more of these criteria apply the Court is still not\npermitted to impose a custodial sentence”...unless [it] has considered all\nalternatives to custody raised at the sentencing hearing that are reasonable in\nthe circumstances, and determined that there is not a reasonable alternative,\nor combination of alternatives, this is in accordance with the purposes and\nprinciples set out in section 38”[10].\n(Underlining mine) Youth Justice Courts “...shall not use custody as a substitute\nfor appropriate child protection, mental health or other social measures”[11].[19]It has been said that there is “only one rule” of modern\nstatutory interpretation: The court must consider all relevant and admissible\nindicators of legislative meaning, including legislative context, the\npresumptions and special rules of interpretation, and external aids. It must\nthen come to an interpretation which complies with the legislative text,\npromotes the legislative purpose and produces an outcome that is reasonable and\njust[12].Cases[20]Counsel for the Appellant and Respondent said that they have\nsearched exhaustively and were unable to locate any authority that considered\nthe specific point raised by this appeal. They each referred to some decisions,\nnone of which were at the appellate level, which dealt with the issue\ntangentially or commented in obiter. I have read the authorities provided by\ncounsel and several of them have assisted me in deciding this case. I will\nrefer to these briefly before turning to my analysis of the issue in this case.R. v. C.(D.L.)[21]Gorman, P.C.J., sentenced the young person in R. v. C.(D.L.)[13]\nfor two counts of break and enter and one breach of a non-custodial\ndisposition[14].\nHe imposed nine months custody on the young person for each break and entry\ncharges and three months for the breach of the non-custodial disposition, all\nto be served concurrently. He discussed the limitations that s. 39 of the new Act\nplaced on the court’s ability to impose custodial sentences and made these\ncomments about para. 39(1 )(b) in particular: “Subsection 39(1 )(b) of the\n[Youth Criminal Justice] Act allows the Court to impose a period of custody\nif the ‘young person has failed to comply with noncustodial\nsentences’. Interestingly, this category requires a failure to comply with more\nthan one such sentence...”[15]\n(Underlining mine)[22]Gorman, P.C.J., found that break and entry is a “violent” offence\nwithin the meaning of para. 39(1 )(a) and imposed custodial sentences without\nreferring to para. 39(1 )(b). His remarks are obiter of the decision, although\nC.(D.L.) had a lengthy record with five convictions for failure to comply with\na disposition under the Young Offenders Act, all of which had resulted\nin custody, both open and secure.R. v. 1.(D.A.)[23]R. v. I.(D.A.)[16]\ndealt with a Crown application to detain the young person pending trial.\nSection 29(2) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act contains a presumption\nthat pretrial detention is not necessary if “...the young person could not, on\nbeing found guilty, be committed to custody on the grounds set out in\nsubsection 39(1)(a) to (c)”. I.(D.A.) was charged with possession of a stolen\nmotor vehicle and with “hit and run” offences. He had a prior record which\nincluded breach of a curfew, for which he was given a conditional discharge and\nplaced on probation for two months.[24]Auxier, P.C.J., disagreed with the Crown’s suggestion that s.\n33(2) of the Interpretation Act[17]\napplied to the interpretation of the phrase “non-custodial sentences” in para.\n39(1 )(b). The subsection reads: “Words in the singular include the plural and\nwords in the plural include the singular”. He refused to consider I .(D. A.)’s\nsingle prior conviction for breach of a curfew as sufficient to rebut the\npresumption that I.(D.A.) should not be detained prior to trial: “...[I]t’s\nclear that the intention of the [Youth Criminal Justice] Act is\ntoward avoiding incarceration of young persons. If the Crown could rebut the\npresumption against pretrial detention merely by showing that the accused had\none breach of a non custodial disposition, it would be contrary to that intent”[18].R. v. A.(E.S.)[25]In R. v. A.(E.S.)[19],\nthe Crown urged the Court to apply s. 33(2) of the Interpretation Act to\nthe single breach of probation on A.(E.S.)’s record so that it could impose\ncustody on him for having had sexual contact with a child contrary to s. 151 of\nthe Criminal Code[20].\nOnce again the Court refused: “...I have concluded that the Crown cannot\nsucceed on this argument. In my opinion, the entire scheme of the [Youth\nCriminal Justice] Act is such that incarceration should only be used for\nthe most serious offences. To give section 39(1 )(b) the meaning suggested by\nCrown counsel, would, in my opinion, be contrary to the scheme of this Act. In\nmy opinion, section 39(1)(b) can only be read as meaning the plural and not the\nsingular”[21].R. v. C.(W.S.)[22][26]C.(W.S.) applied for bail. She was charged with numerous\noffences, including one breach of probation and several breaches of\nundertaking. The Crown argued that the breaches of undertaking should be treated\nas “non-custodial sentences”, justifying her detention. Whalen, P.C.J.,\nrejected the argument, saying that a “...plain reading of this section\nrestricts its application to failures to comply with non-custodial sentences”.\nHe added these comments: “There must be more than one failure to comply with a\nnon-custodial sentence. It suggests that two failures to comply with one\nprevious non-custodial sentence would not qualify, but rather that there\nmust have been a failure to comply with two separate non-custodial\nsentences”[23].\n(Underlining mine)Legal Commentary[27]Paragraph 39(1)(b) has been commented on by authors who\nspecialize in the area of youth criminal justice law. The Honourable Peter J.\nHarris of the Ontario Court of Justice dealt briefly with the interpretation of\npara. 39(1)(b) in his Youth Criminal Justice Act Manual: “It is\nimportant to note that since the word “sentences” is plural there must be at\nleast two previous failures to comply with non-custodial sentences”[24].\n(Underlining mine)[28]Tustin and Lutes asked the question that I have to decide in this\nappeal in the 2004 edition of their text, A Guide to the Youth Criminal\nJustice Act[25].\nThey declined to answer it directly but inferred that “...a young person would not\nneed to have two separate noncustodial sentences as two breaches of any\nsentence would suffice even if they both arise from the same sentence”[26].\n(Underlining mine). They justified their inference by observing that the\n“intent” of s. 39(1) is “...to reinforce the principle that non-custodial\nsentences should be used before using custody...”[27].[29]Nick Bala is not in doubt about how para. 39(1 )(b) of the Act\nshould be interpreted: “This provision clearly requires that there must\nhave been at least two prior non-custodial sentences which the youth did not\ncomply with”[28].Analysis[30]I agree with Nick Bala’s interpretation of para. 39(1 )(b) of the\nYouth Criminal Justice Act. It is as clear to me as it is to Bala that a\nyoung person can only be given a custodial sentence under para. 39(1 )(b) if he\nhas failed to comply with more than one non-custodial sentence. Multiple\nfailures to comply with one noncustodial sentence are not enough, but at least\ntwo failures to comply with two separate noncustodial sentences are sufficient.\nI will explain.[31]It is clear from the Youth Criminal Justice Act that the\nlegislators were concerned that youth courts were relying too heavily on\ncustodial dispositions under the Young Offenders Act. Concern about\nover-reliance on incarceration for young persons is written into the preamble\nof the Youth Criminal Justice Act and appears expressly or by\nimplication in many of the substantive parts of the legislation.[32]The Act makes repeated calls for using the least\nrestrictive sanctions that are justifiable when sentencing young persons.\nCustodial sentences can only be imposed as last resort. Even if custodial\nsentences are available under s. 39(1) of the Act they must not be\nimposed until the court considers all reasonable alternatives. Pre-trial\ndetention cannot be ordered until the Crown has shown that the young person, if\nconvicted, could be sentenced to custody under paragraphs 39(1 )(a) to (c) of\nthe Act.[33]Paragraph 39(1 )(b) appears in this legislative milieu and must\nbe interpreted accordingly. The Youth Criminal Justice Act provides a\nrange of sentences which can be imposed by the Court before custody, the\nultimate sanction, should be considered. The alternatives cover a broad\nspectrum starting with a reprimand, through absolute and conditional\ndischarges, fines of up to $1,000, and restitution and probation for up to two\nyears. Community or personal service work orders for the victim are also\navailable, as are participation in a community-based program of intensive\nsupervision and support. Custody cannot be imposed if one of these sentences is\na reasonable alternative. Custody may never be used as a substitute for\nappropriate child protection, mental health or other social measures.[34]There is a loosely-applied notion that sentences for\noffenders should build progressively in severity. Of course, this is heavily\ndependent on the circumstances of both the offence and the offender and is\nlikely observed as much in breach as in application. The Youth Criminal\nJustice Act responded to a concern that this idea might be at work in youth\njustice courts by expressly providing that “[t]he previous imposition of a\nparticular non-custodial sentence on a young person does not preclude a youth\njustice court from imposing the same or any other noncustodial sentence for\nanother offence”[29].\nThis is included in the legislation out of an abundance of concern that courts\nwill not use non-custodial sentences as frequently as they might, especially if\nthey have not been effective before.[35]Paragraph 39(1)(b) of the Act provides one of the four\ncriteria that must be met before a young person can be given a custodial\nsentence. Custody cannot be ordered unless one of these criteria is met. The\nsentencing judge has less discretion to impose custody under the new Act than\nhe had under the Young Offenders Act, which it replaced[30].\nThe new Act emphasizes a need to reduce the use of incarceration when\nsentencing young persons and para. 39(1 )(b) must be interpreted according to\nits context.[36]The implications of this are obvious: If para. 39(1 )(b) is open\nto alternative readings, one of which could result in a higher incidence of\ncustodial sentences, the other reading must be adopted. The parties to this\nappeal have argued that para. 39(1)(b) is open to alternative interpretations.\nThe defence says that the words “noncustodial sentences” can only have one\nmeaning: The young person must have received at least two prior sentences that\ndid not involve custody.[37]The Crown says that this reading of the words is too restricted.\nIt says that the plural “sentences” in para. 39(1 )(b) must be read generically\nso that the court may impose custody on young persons, like the Appellant, who\nhave failed to comply more than once with a single prior non-custodial\nsentence. In effect, the Crown says that the Appellant’s two failures to comply\nwith the probation order made in October, 2003 are “non-custodial sentences”\nthat expose him to a custodial sentence now.[38]The Crown says that the defence’s interpretation of para. 39(1\n)(b) may lead to absurd consequences: A young person could commit numerous\nbreaches of a single probation order (or other non-custodial sentence) and the\ncourt would never be able to impose custody on him, regardless of the severity\nof the breaches. I agree with the Crown that a young person might never be\nexposed to the risk of a custodial sentence in those circumstances. However, it\nis not absurd because that is what the law intended to achieve.[39]But it is also an unlikely scenario: How reasonable is it that a\nyoung person could repeatedly breach a probation order without running afoul of\nthe other criteria in s. 39(1 ) of the Act? Or, how likely is it that\nthe same young person would avoid another non-custodial sentence arising from\none of his breaches which he would just as readily breach, so that he then has\nmore than one non-custodial sentence on his record that he has failed to comply\nwith[31]?[40]The Appellant’s interpretation of para. 39(1 )(b) will result in\nfewer custodial sentences for young persons. Custody cannot be imposed on a\nyoung offender who has failed to comply with only one non-custodial sentence,\nregardless of the number of times that he has failed to comply. It is\nself-evident that there will be fewer young persons who have received more than\none non-custodial sentence than there will be young persons who have received a\nsingle non-custodial sentence. There should, by extension, be fewer custodial\nsentences and that is one of the main themes of the Youth Criminal Justice\nAct.[41]My analysis of the issue in this case has proceeded on the\nsupposition that the words “non-custodial sentences” are ambiguous, that they\nallow for alternative, if not competing, interpretations. That is wrong. The\nwords are not ambiguous. The plural “sentences” simply means, as it should,\nmore than one. If para. 39(1 )(b) had been intended to include a single\nnon-custodial sentence, singular “sentence” could have been as easily used so\nthat the criterion defined by that paragraph would have been “...failed to\ncomply with a non-custodial sentence”.[42]It is equally wrong to interpret the words of the paragraph as\nthe Crown is suggesting so that the Appellant’s two failures to comply with the\nOctober, 2003 probation order bring him within its meaning. This is the effect\nof what the Crown is suggesting: The words “failed to comply with non-custodial\nsentences”, can mean, “failed at least twice to comply with a non-custodial\nsentence”. The words cannot bear that meaning.[43]The youth justice court judge made an error of law: He relied on\npara. 39(1)(b) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act to impose custodial\nsentences on the Appellant when he sentenced him in February, 2004. He was not\npermitted to impose custody since it had not been shown that the Appellant had\nfailed to comply with noncustodial sentences. The Appellant’s two failures to\ncomply with the non-custodial sentence that he received in October, 2003 do not\nmake para. 39(1 )(b) of the Act applicable to him. The Crown and defence\nagree, as I do, that none of the other criteria in s. 39(1) of the Act apply\nto the Appellant. There was no basis to give him custody.[44]The custody of the Appellant received is set aside. This includes\nthe community supervision order that the youth justice court judge made\npursuant to s. 42(2)(n) of the Act, effective for 90 days from when the\nexpiration of custody.A Fit Sentence[45]The youth justice court judge said that he was primarily\nconcerned with the Appellant’s rehabilitation. He felt that a closed custody\nsentence would help the Appellant to rehabilitate himself. The pre-sentence\nreport the judge relied on indicated that the Appellant’s parents had no\ncontrol over him, there was conflict in his family, his associates were older\nthan and had a negative influence on him, and he used alcohol and marihuana\nindiscriminately. The report also said that the Appellant had shown that he was\nunable to comply with a probation order.[46]The pre-sentence report was not entirely negative: It did show\nthat the Appellant was gaining insight into how drugs and alcohol affected him,\nthat he had the ability and was determined to succeed academically, and, that\nhe accepted responsibility for his actions. It is also noteworthy that the\nAppellant was reported to be “...shocked when he realized that he would be\nspending a night in jail...”[32]\nfollowing his arrest for breaching the probation order by being intoxicated in\nNovember, 2003.[47]I am not certain how the sentencing judge expected that a closed\ncustody sentence would promote the Appellant’ rehabilitation. It is likely that\nhe wanted to provide some temporary structure in the Appellant’s life and\npossibly to enhance the shock value of the Appellant’s night in jail.[48]It is not necessary for me to remit this matter to the youth\njustice court judge for sentencing. I have the complete record of what was\nbefore that court, including the transcript from the sentencing hearing, and I\nam in as good a position as was the judge at first instance to\ndecide what an appropriate sentence is for the Appellant. I agree with\nthe sentencing judge that the Appellant needs more structure in his life.\nCustody, which can provide the ultimate structure, is not available as a\nsentencing option. But structure can be provided by lengthening the probation\norder that was made at first instance and bolstering its terms.[49]Two things should be noted: The Appellant is no longer a “young\nperson”. He was 18 on June 8,2004 and will appear in adult court in the future.\nAs well, the Appellant lives with his mother and she has made it clear that she\nwill not tolerate it when he breaches his probation. She has provided, and I\nhope will continue to provide, an important and necessary policing function\nover the Appellant’s conduct.[50]The probation that the youth justice court judge ordered was\nscheduled to come into effect after the expiration of the custodial sentences\nand the community supervision. It comes into effect immediately. Its duration\nis increased from 12 to 18 months and will include, in addition to the\nstatutory conditions and those imposed by the sentencing judge, the following:• Adhere to a curfew to be set by the Appellant’s mother in\nconsultation with the Youth Court Worker.• Refrain from associating or having contact with those\npersons identified by the Appellant’s mother who have a negative influence on\nhim. A list of names shall be compiled by the Appellant’s mother in consultation\nwith the Youth Court Worker. The original of the list is to be filed with this\ncourt by July 31, 2004. A copy of the list shall be provided to the Appellant\nand the Youth Court Worker and one is to be retained by the Appellant’s mother.Summary and Disposition[51]The Appellant appealed a sentence that was imposed on him by a\nProvincial Court Judge sitting as a Youth Justice Court under the Youth\nCriminal Justice Act. The sentence included three concurrent terms of\nclosed custody, followed by community supervision, and then probation. The\nAppellant claimed that the custodial sentences were not authorized by law and\nshould be set aside. Alternatively, he claimed that custody was not necessary\nand should be revisited on general sentencing principles.[52]Custody was not authorized. The only possible based for the\ncustody was the criterion set out in para. 39(1 )(b) of the Youth Criminal\nJustice Act. However, it did not apply here since the Appellant had failed\nto comply with a single non-custodial sentence, and not “sentences” as required\nby the statute. The custody is set aside. It was unnecessary to remit the\nmatter to the youth justice court judge for sentencing. The Appellant needed\nstructure in his life and this could be achieved by lengthening his probation\nand adding to its conditions.Order[53]In the result, I order that:I. The appeal is allowed.II. The custodial sentences imposed by the Youth Justice Court\nJudge are set aside.III. The probation order takes effect immediately, and its\nlength is increased from 12 to 18 months.IV. The following conditions are added to the probation:a. Adhere to a curfew to be set by the Appellant’s mother in\nconsultation with the Youth Court Worker.b. Refrain from associating or having\ncontact with those persons identified by the Appellant’s mother who have a\nnegative influence on him. A list of names shall be compiled by the Appellant’s\nmother in consultation with the Youth Court Worker. The original of the list is\nto be filed with this court by July 31, 2004. A copy of the list shall be\nprovided to the Appellant and the Youth Court Worker and one is to be retained\nby the Appellant’s mother.

Immediately after Whalen, P.C.J., makes this observation, he\nadds a further comment: “This is consistent with the pattern that is referred\nto in s. 39(1)(c)”. Nick Bala drew a similar comparison to the “pattern” that\nis referred to in para. 39(1 )(c) in his text Youth Criminal Justice Law, Irwin\nLaw, p. 449: “Section 39(1 )(c) is intended to allow a youth justice court to\nrespond with a custodial sentence to a case where a youth has a history of\nnonviolent offending. The use of the plural ‘findings’ requires, at a minimum,\nat least two prior convictions. Indeed, in contrast to section 39(1)(b), the\nuse of the words ‘history’ and ‘pattern’ and the plural ‘findings’ in section\n39(1 )(c) suggests that there must be at least three prior offences.”[24]\nCanada Law Book Inc., p. 4-9.[25]\nLexisNexis, Butterworths.[26]\nIbid, p. 65.[27]\nIbid.[28]\nIbid, footnote 23, p. 448.[29]\nSection 39(4).[30]Tustin and Lutes noted that the YOA provided “...few rules to\nsafeguard against a youth’s circumstances influencing the decision for a\ncustody sentence. For example, some youth court judges routinely ordered a\nyouth found guilty of assault into custody, even when the assault was less\nserious and the youth was a first-time offender”. Ibid, footnote 25, p. 66. See\nalso Nick Bala’s comments on this point: “In contract to section 24 of the YOA,\nwhich allowed a discretionary balancing of factors when judges were deciding\nwhether to impose a custodial disposition, section 39 of the YCJA imposes clear\npreconditions which must be satisfied before a custodial sentence can be\nimposed”. Ibid, footnote 23, p. 447.[31]\nA young person may be shown to have failed to comply with a non-custodial\nsentence if no charge was laid under s. 137 of the Youth Criminal Justice\nAct or s. 26 of the Young Offenders Act. Paragraph 39(1 )(b) is\nconcerned with “failures to comply with” and not convictions for breaches of\nnon-custodial sentences. Thus, as Andrea Tuck-Jackson says in the Annotated\nYouth Criminal Justice Act Service (LexisNexis, Butterworths, p. 3177),\n“...the Crown could establish the previous non-compliance as part of the\nsentencing process, either based on an admission by the youth or via evidence\ncalled at the sentencing hearing that proves the youth’s failure to comply with\nnon-custodial sentences beyond a reasonable doubt”. It will generally be easier\nfor the Crown to prove prior non-compliance as part of the sentencing process\nthan it will be to charge the young person with non-compliance and obtain a\nconviction that becomes a part of his record. This possibility lowers the\nthreshold somewhat for the Crown and exposes the young person to greater risk\nof matching the criterion set out in s. 39(1 )(b).[32]\nPage 4 of the Pre-sentence Report dated February 9, 2004."}

No. 100Between:Her Majesty the QueenandSelby Floyd CurtisSchwartz, J.Counsel:Mark Linehan, for the Crown;Barbara MacAdam, for the accused.[1]Schwartz, J. [orally]: Selby Floyd Curtis has pleaded guilty to\nthe following two charges:\"1. That on or about the 24th day of October, A.D., 1998\nat or near [name of town omitted], in the Province of Newfoundland, did commit\na sexual assault on E.J. contrary to section 271 of the Criminal Code of Canada.2. That on or about the 24th day of October, A.D., 1998 at or\nnear [name of town omitted], in the Province of Newfoundland, without lawful\nexcuse did enter the dwelling house of E.J. situate at [name of town omitted],\nin the Province of Newfoundland with intent to commit an indictable offence\ntherein, contrary to Section 349(1) of the Criminal Code of Canada.\"[2]The only issue in this matter is the determination of an\nappropriate sentence.Facts[3]An agreed statement of facts was filed with the Court which\nrelates that at approximately 2:30 a.m. on the morning of October 24, 1998 the\naccused knocked on the complainant's window at her residence in [name of town\nomitted], Newfoundland. He then forced his way into the home.[4]The complainant asked the accused to leave her property after he\nentered. He indicated he would, but instead, Curtis grabbed the complainant,\nforced her onto a bed, and began taking her pants off. The accused placed his\nhand over the complainant's mouth and threatened her by saying \"if you\ntell anyone you'll be sorry.\" He then removed the complainant's clothing\nand penetrated her vagina.[5]After, the accused asked for other sexual acts but this was\nrefused by the complainant. He proceeded to leave but before doing so stated:\n\"I'll be back again tonight and if you don't let me in I'll come through\nthe window again.\" He then left the residence and the complainant\nimmediately went to her brother's home and called the police.[6]It is on the foregoing facts that convictions were entered\nconcerning both charges.The Victim[7]E.J. is a widow and presently 36 of age. In a victim impact\nstatement she related she is afraid of the accused and sometimes afraid to\nsleep at night thinking that the accused will come back into her home.[8]The incident has caused the victim considerable emotional\nupheaval and she now has difficulty trusting male individuals.The accused[9]Selby Floyd Curtis is a 33 year old individual and the father of\ntwo children. He is divorced from his former spouse.[10]The accused has a Grade Six education and during his working life\nhas had periods of employment as a labourer.Sentencing Considerations[11]In R. v. Vokey (H.A.) (2000), 2000 NFCA 14 (CanLII), 186 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 1;\n564 A.P.R. 1 (Nfld. C.A.), the Newfoundland Court of Appeal determined that an\neighteen month sentence for a sexual assault involving intercourse with a young\ncomplainant was out of the normal sentencing range considered to be generally\nappropriate. The court found at p. 14 of that decision:\"The appropriate range, absent special circumstances, is\nthat stated by the Crown before this court, that is, 3 to 5 years. However,\nthat alone is not determinative of the issue. As this court noted in R. v.\nR.W.B., [see Note 3 below] which is filed concurrently with this decision,\nthere may exist factors which could result in a lesser or greater sentence than\nthe normal range.\"[12]Courts in this jurisdiction have recognized that the appropriate\nsentence for a sexual assault, which involves intercourse, should be three\nyears or more dependent on the circumstances of a particular case.[13]Aggravating factors which I have considered in this matter\ninclude the degree of violence used by the accused. Curtis forced his way into\nthe complainant's home in the early hours of the morning, took control of his\nvictim, threatened physical harm if she told anyone, and further threatened\nthat he would return to the house.[14]The accused also has a criminal record containing assault related\noffences and threats for which he has been incarcerated.[15]This court has also considered the mitigating factors which\nfavour the accused. These include the guilty pleas to the charges, which has\nsaved the complainant the further trauma of coming to court to give evidence,\nand the fact that the accused was co-operative with the R.C.M.P. after his\narrest.Sentence[16]I have considered the foregoing and the submissions of counsel in\ndetermining an appropriate sentence in this matter.[17]In cases of sexual assault such as this I am satisfied\nthat the principles of deterrence, punishment, and protection of the public\nmust be paramount in determining a proper sentence. However, the sentence must\nnever be used as a tool of vengeance against the accused.[18]Mr. Curtis has spent 5.5 months in pretrial custody before a\ndetermination was made by the Crown that such was not necessitated. Generally,\nany pretrial custody is multiplied by two and credited toward a final sentence\nfor an accused. I am satisfied the accused has spent the equivalent of one year\nof incarceration for these offences prior to this hearing.[19]An appropriate sentence for this charge of sexual assault,\nwithout consideration of the time already spent in custody, would be in the\nrange of 3.5 years. I am therefore sentencing the accused to a further 30\nmonths in Her Majesty's Penitentiary for this offence after giving due\nconsideration to the pretrial custody.[20]Mr. Curtis is also sentenced to a further six months in Her\nMajesty's Penitentiary for the breach of s. 349(1) of the Criminal Code of Canada. This is to be served concurrent with the previous sentence.[21]The accused is also prohibited from possessing any firearm,\ncrossbow, prohibitive weapon, restricted weapon, prohibitive device,\nammunition, prohibited ammunition, and explosive substance for a period of 10\nyears following the accused's release from imprisonment. Order accordingly."}

C-46 ss.122, 368.(1), 386.(1)(c), 718.(1), 718.(2).REASONS FOR JUDGMENTDYMOND, J.:[1]Wilson (Wally) Andersen has entered guilty pleas to two Counts: one\nCount for uttering forged documents in connection with his public duties\nagainst the government; the second Count involves breach of trust in connection\nwith his public duties against the government, contrary to s.122 of the Criminal\nCode.[2]s.368. (1) states:“Every one who, knowing that a document is\nforged,(a) uses, deals with or acts upon it,\nor(b) causes or\nattempts to cause any per to use, deal with or act upon it, as if the document\nwere genuine,(c) is guilty of an\nindictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a terms not exceeding ten\nyears.[3]The total amount relating to the forgery charge as set out in an Agreed\nStatement of Facts is $59,054.34.(See Schedule “A”, attached.)The Agreed\nStatement of Facts sets out one instance involving the purchase invoice of a snowmobile.The amount involving the forgery was $6,020, which was fictitious.[4]The largest dollar amount of the forgery count involves translation\nservices that did not take place.This involved some 69 forged invoices, which\nresulted in $33,559.50 being claimed for services which did not take place.[5]These fraudulent transactions span over the years 1997 through to 2006.The Agreed Statement of Fact sets out other areas of forged documents involving\nthe rent of office space, transportation, and a housing study that was never\nconducted.A final area involves the payment of a $600 light bill on behalf of\na client.It was not Mr. Andersen’s light bill, but one of his constituent’s\nlight bills, where the constituent could not afford to pay the bill and\nAndersen forged documents to cover the cost.[6]Count number 2 involves s.122 of the Criminal Code set out below:“Every official who, in connection with the\nduties of his office, commits fraud or a breach of trust is guilty of an\nindictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five\nyears, whether or not the fraud or breach of trust would be an offence if it\nwere committed in relation to a private person.”[7]The activities involving this offence related to expenditures over and\nabove monies allowed for constituency allowance spending.[8]In the fiscal year 2002 – 2003, Mr. Andersen claimed $15,657 over and\nabove what he was entitled to claim legitimately.In the fiscal year 2003 –\n2004, Mr. Andersen claimed $14,783 over and above what he was entitled to as\nset out on page 13 of the Agreed Statement of Facts.These were monies that\nwere claimed without receipts, mainly due to the poor system of accountability\nthat was in place at the House of Assembly to catch such over-spending by MHAs\nin the years 2003 and 2004.[9]The system was based on the honor system.MHAs knew their spending\nallowances; anything over should have been caught by the system.For reasons\noutlined in a public inquiry into the spending habits of MHAs, it is clearly\ndocumented why these allowances were not picked up.The accused has admitted\nto his over-spending on these amounts.He admits that he had knowledge of the\nover-spending in the amount of $30,440, set out in the Agreed Statement of\nFacts.THE ACCUSED[10]Mr. Wally Andersen, as he likes to be referred to, is now 59 years of\nage.He has served in public life as an MHA for the large geographic district\nof Torngat Mountains in Labrador, since first being elected as a member of the\nHouse of Assembly in 1996.He remained in that position until his resignation\nin 2007.[11]Mr. Andersen served as the Minister of Labrador and Aboriginal Affairs\nfrom February of 2003 to October of 2003.That particular position ended as a\nresult of the election which took place in 2003.Mr. Andersen now comes before\nthe Court as a first-time offender.Although of aboriginal ancestral descent,\nMr. Andersen does not ask the Court to consider his aboriginal background,\npursuant to the Gladue Principles for the purposes of sentencing.Through his\ncounsel, Mr. Andersen says this would not be appropriate under the circumstances\nof this case.As such, I will deal with the sentencing of Mr. Andersen as I\nwould any first-time offender that comes before this Court.[12]I have no further personal information on Mr. Andersen, other than what\nhis counsel has put on the record.[13]Mr. Andersen makes no excuses for his behavior by way of alcohol abuse,\ndrug abuse or gambling addictions, which are so often the case in these types\nof crimes.Monies acquired by fraudulent means are often used to feed the\nhabit of offenders, as referred to in R. v. Benrtson 2000 SKCA 47 (CanLII), [2000] S.J. 237 (Sask.C.A).This is not the case with Mr. Andersen.So Wally Andersen, directly in his own\nwords and through the words of his counsel, claims that his weakest attribute\nwas that he did not know how to say no to his constituents who were often in\nneed of necessities, including shelter, heat and light, and other basics.[14]Mr. Andersen himself, when asked if he had anything to add to what his\ncounsel had to say on his behalf, did say he did not personally benefit from the\nmonies unlawfully in his possession, as a result of these fraudulent means.This may well be the case; however, Mr. Andersen would have benefited\nindirectly by being able to do things for his constituents which members who\ndid not over-spend were unable to do.This is an unproven or untraceable\npossible benefit.As the Crown quite properly pointed out, that is why there\nare spending limits, to create a level playing field.If elected members\ncannot be trusted to obey the law, then what message does that send to the\ngeneral public.[15]That said, I accept that some of these monies could well have been used\nfor the benefit of Mr. Andersen’s constituents.This however does not take\naway from the fact that Mr. Andersen, as a public official, broke the law over\na considerable period of time and this is not a case of an isolated incident.CASE LAW[16]Sentences for these types of offences vary from sentences which involve\nsuspended sentences in isolated instances, to federal prison terms for other\noffences, and conditional sentences with house arrest for specific individual\ncases, or straight periods of imprisonment.(Refer to cases set out in Crown’s\nList of Authorities.)[17]The most recent decision of this jurisdiction is the case of R. v.\nByrne, 2009, Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R., 286 (Prov.Ct.), a decision arising out\nof the same spending scandal as is Mr. Andersen’s case.The case is relevant\nin that Honourable Chief Judge D. Mark Pike, of the Provincial Court, who\npresided over the Byrne decision, has canvassed many of the cases that\nhave been submitted by counsel in the present case.I will review a couple of\nthese cases in a few minutes.It is sufficient to state that Judge D. Mark\nPike’s analysis was thorough and up-to-date.[18]In the Byrne decision, the issue before the Trial Judge was not\nso much the length of the sentence as it was whether the sentence should be\nserved conditionally in the community with house arrest.Judge Pike summed up\nhis view on that issue at paragraph 42 of his decision, when he stated:“In circumstances such as these, the need for\ndenunciation is so pressing that incarceration in custody is the only suitable\nway to express society’s condemnation of the offender’s conduct.A message\nmust be sent by the sentence imposed by the court that will help the public\nunderstand that this conduct was highly reprehensible and that it carries with\nit serious criminal consequences.”[19]In that case, it was pointed out to Judge Pike that a conditional\nsentence could, in fact, be appropriate for a fraud case.The Judge summed up\nthe situation after citing the case of R. v. Coffin, (2006) 2006 QCCA 471 (CanLII), 210 CCC\n(3rd) 227 (Que.C.A.), which was on appeal from a two year conditional\nsentence.At paragraph 35 of the Byrne decision, the Judge cites the\nCoffin decision:“After a thorough review of the cases, the\nCourt of Appeal concluded as follows:66This should not be seen to imply\nthat conditional sentences may not be imposed in cases of fraud; indeed, the\ndecisions cited by the respondent illustrate that they may.It should be noted\nhowever that, generally speaking, conditional sentences have been granted by\nappellate courts in response to particular circumstances.67In the R. v. Bunn, a decision of the\nSupreme Court, the amount of money was only $86,000.68As the attached table shows, counsel\nfor the respondent have also cited one decision of the Court of Appeal of\nAlberta, two of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, and four of this Court and one\nof the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan, all of which granted conditional\nsentences in cases of fraud.69Of all the judgments relied upon by\nthe respondent, only Moulton involved a misappropriation of public funds\n(approximately $274,000).In other cases of fraud against the government or\none of its agencies, appellate courts have imposed custodial sentences.See R.\nv. Kerntopf (5 years), R. v. Dudek (4 years) R. v. Bouchard (1 year), R. v.\nPoirier (3 years), R. V Oliynyk (1 year) and R. v. Bernston (1 year).”[20]Judge Pike then concludes, at paragraph 36 of the Byrne decision,\nas follows:“[36]The court in Coffin (supra) went on\nto find that the “prime objectives” of general deterrence and denunciation were\nnot given proper consideration by the sentencing judge.The conditional\nsentence was set aside and a period of 18 months in custody substituted.”[21]In Coffin, the accused was a first-time offender who had pleaded\nguilty to 15 counts of fraud through his advertising company; the accused\nsubmitted 373 fraudulent invoices to the Government of Canada, with a total\nmisappropriation ofa little over $1.5 million dollars.The accused was 62\nyears old with no criminal record.[22]After reviewing the case law set out above, Judge Pike imposed the two\nyears less a day in prison sentence on Mr. Byrne for bribery and for defrauding\nthe Provincial Government.[23]In Judge Pike’s conclusion at paragraph 37, he states:“[37]In many aspects, the circumstances of\nthe offences committed by Byrne were more egregious than those in Coffin\n(supra) and the other cases cited above in paragraph 33 in which custodial sentences\nwere held to be appropriate.There is a higher degree of moral\nblameworthiness.”[24]In the case of Wally Andersen, neither the Crown nor the Defence is\nasking the Court to impose a conditional sentence on Mr. Andersen.The issue\nbefore me is: what is a proper sentence for Mr. Andersen for the two offences\nhe had pleaded guilty to.POSITION OF THE CROWN AND DEFENCE AS TO THELENGTH OF SENTENCE[25]The Crown makes its case based on the Byrne decision, and cases\nsuch as R. v. Bogart, 2002 CanLII 41073 (ON CA), 167, CCC (3rd) 390; 2002 Carswell Ont. 2537 (C.A),\nwhere the court imposed 18 months incarceration; and the case of R. v.\nCoffin, (2006) 2006 QCCA 471 (CanLII), 210 CCC (3rd) 227 (Que.C.A.), I referred to at paragraph 19\nabove, where the court set aside a two year conditional sentence and\nsubstituted 18 months imprisonment along with restitution.[26]The Crown argues that the sentence on Mr. Andersen should be either at\nthe high end of two years less a day, and no lower than 18 months globally for\nthe two offences before the court.[27]The Defence asked the court to consider the circumstances of Mr.\nAnderson, the size of his district, the fact that there was no monetary gain\n(something the Crown disputes), the guilty plea, and the fact that Mr. Andersen\nis a first-time offender, and the circumstances surrounding how the monies were\nused to impose a low end sentence of six months to a high end of nine months.[28]ANALYSIS(A) Mitigating Factors:[29]The plea of guilty is a mitigating factor.The fact that Mr. Andersen\nis a first-time offender is also a mitigating factor.The fact that the motive\nwas not for personal gain or greed is a factor the court has to consider.Some\nof the monies may have been redirected to the constituency and its\nconstituents, according to counsel for Mr. Andersen and Mr. Andersen’s own\nstatement.Mr. Andersen certainly gained indirectly as a result of his\nactions, as I explained earlier.Mr. Andersen has expressed remorse for is\nactions, which I accept as genuine, and his guilty plea was timely, considering\nthe length of time the investigation took and the complexity of the\ndocumentation involved.(B)Aggravating factors:[30]Mr. Andersen was an MHA and a Cabinet Minister for at least part of the\ntime these offences were committed.He was aware he had spending limits, yet\nhe exceeded these limits.He was aware that services he claimed for did not\ntake place and the forgeries were numerous and continued over several years.Mr. Andersenbreached a position of public trust.These are all aggravating factors\nto consider in this case.[31]The Crown argues that the case is similar to the Byrne decision\nand the Coffin decision, therefore justifying an upper limit in relation\nto sentencing and that the high end of 24 months is appropriate.[32]However, I have reviewed the Byrne decision and I feel that it is\ndistinguishable from the case at bar to some degree.Mr. Byrne had been\ncharged with bribery.He induced an employee at the House of Assembly by\nallegedly paying some $18,000 to get extra monies.The maximum sentence for\nbribery is 14 years in prison.Mr. Byrne was also clearly the beneficiary of\nthese monies.The charge of forgery has a 10 year maximum penalty and any\nsentence should reflect the maximum placed by Parliament for each offence that\nan offender is either found guilty of or pleads guilty to.[33]These are observations that are relevant to the sentencing judge, but\nnot necessarily important to the public, who looks at bribery, forgery, and\nfraud all in the same light.In other words, public money has gone missing.[34]Bribery of a public official, I submit, is a more serious offence than\nis forgery.Mr. Andersen did not involve a third party in his actions to\ndefraud; it is his own responsibility.That is not to say it is not serious,\nbut it is less serious and distinguishable, but not forgivable in the context\nof sentencing.[35]The deterrence principle, both general and specific, as outline in s.718.(1)\nand 718.(2) of the Criminal Code, is meant to deter Mr. Andersen from\nfuture criminal activity.More importantly, the deterrence of like-minded\npersons who serve public office or are in positions of trust has to be\ntargeted.[36]This is why a conditional sentence of two years or any time less than\ntwo years is not an appropriate sentence on the facts and the circumstances Mr.\nAndersen finds himself in.[37]I have carefully reviewed the Statement of Fact as introduced by the\nCrown and the Defence.I have reviewed the cases as presented by Mr. Coffey\nand Ms. Knickle and I have carefully considered the arguments put forward by\nboth the Crown and the Defence.[38]Mr. Andersen, would you please stand?[39]I have decided that an appropriate sentence on the forgery charge, under\ns.386(1)(c), considering everything that I have said above, to be 15 months in\nprison.In relation to the breach of s.122, breach of trust by a public\nofficial, an appropriate sentence should be 9 months in prison, to be served\nconcurrent to Count number one.[40]I will impose a Restitution Order to be paid by Mr. Andersen, in the\namount of $89,474.34, to be repaid to the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador.The terms of repayment should be negotiated with the representatives of the\nGovernment of Newfoundland and Labrador; that no amount will have to be repaid\nuntil Mr. Andersen is released from prison.[41]This sentence will not satisfy the public; however, I believe the\nsentence is a reasonable balance for deterrence of you and like-minded\ngovernment officials.Yet, it is not so crushing that it will prevent you from\nrehabilitating yourself and allowing yourself to become a productive member of\nthe public, in much the same way you were when you were an MHA for Labrador.[42]I see no need for a probationary period following the release, as I\nbelieve Mr. Andersen is at a low risk to re-offend._____________________________WAYNE\nG.

CARDINAL, JINTRODUCTION[1]Over the course of two days in November 2012, Mr. Neault broke into two\nmotor vehicles and stole three firearms (two rifles and a shotgun) as well as\nsome ammunition and other items.On November 21, 2012, after making inquiries\nas to who might wish to buy these firearms, Mr. Neault found a buyer and sold\nthe three firearms to another person.After the commission of these offences,\nhe committed further offences in December relating to theft of items from\nvehicles.During the police investigation, Mr. Neault told the police that\nanother person had committed the offence of breaking and entering and stealing\na firearm from a vehicle when he knew that was not true.Further police\ninvestigation proved that the named person was not involved and Mr. Neault confessed\nhis own involvement and to misleading the police.[2]As a result of his actions, Mr. Neault has pled guilty to the following\ncharges:Count\n1:Between November 12, 2012 and the 19th day of November 2012, at\nor near Tisdale, Saskatchewan he did break and enter a certain place to wit a\nmotor vehicle situated at the Recplex in Tisdale, Saskatchewan and did steal a\nfirearm located in it contrary to s. 98(1)(b) of the Criminal Code.Count\n2: Between the 12th day of November 2012 and the 19th of\nNovember 2012, did steal Canadian currency, the property of unknown person of a\nvalue not exceeding $5,000.00 contrary to s. 334(b) of the Criminal Code.Count\n6: On or about November 21, 2012, he did transfer a firearm to wit: two rifles\nand a shotgun knowing that he was not authorized to do so contrary to s. 99(2)\nof the Criminal Code.Count\n7: On or about the 8th day of December 2012 and the 11th\nday of December 2012, at Tisdale did steal a GPS system and Canadian currency\nthe property of unknown person of a value not exceeding $5,000.00 contrary to\ns. 334(b) of the Criminal Code.Count\n11: On or about December 17, 2012, did commit public mischief in that with the\nintent to mislead he caused Cst. Cameron Schmidt, a peace officer, to enter\nupon an investigation by making a false statement to Cst. Cameron Schmidt that\naccused N.B. of having committed the offence of break and entering to steal a\nfirearm contrary to s. 140(1)(a) of the Criminal Code.[3]The Crown elected to proceed by indictment with respect to the break and\nenter into the motor vehicle and steal the firearms contrary to s. 98(1)(b) of\nthe Criminal Code, which carries a maximum penalty of life\nimprisonment.There is no minimum penalty.[4]Of concern is the charge that he transferred firearms, being two rifles\nand a shotgun, knowing he was not authorized to do so contrary to s. 99(2) of\nthe Criminal Code.The Crown proceeded by indictment and this offence\ncarries a minimum punishment of imprisonment for a first offence of three years\nand a maximum penalty of imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years.[5]The remaining matters proceeded by way of summary conviction and all carry\na maximum sentence of six months imprisonment.[6]Mr. Neault has given notice and is challenging the constitutional\nvalidity of the mandatory minimum penalty in s. 99(2) of the Criminal Code as\na violation of s. 12 of the Charter, being his right not to be subject\nto cruel and unusual punishment.By agreement of counsel, it was decided that\nthe Court would first determine an appropriate sentence without considering the\nthree year minimum sentence.If I find that a fit sentence is one that is less\nthan three years, further argument will be made regarding the constitutionality\nof s. 99(2) and whether it violates s. 12 of the Charter and if so,\nwhether it can be saved by a s. 1 analysis or if it should be declared of no\nforce and effect.[7]Counsel for Mr. Neault submits that an appropriate sentence is in the\nrange of two years less a day incarceration for all charges, but is not arguing\nthat a Conditional Sentence Order be made.The Crown submits that a global\nsentence of three and one-half years is appropriate, with three years being the\nappropriate sentence for the s. 99 trafficking offence.FACTS[8]The Crown read in the facts and they are not in dispute.On November\n12, 2012, Mr. Neaultand his co-accused looked through vehicles for things to\nsteal.Approximately $5.00 was stolen from one vehicle, and the accused found\na shotgun in another vehicle, stole it and gave it to the co-accused to\nconceal.They returned to Mr. Neault’s\nresidence where Mr. Neault then kept the shotgun, hiding it in a mattress under\na trailer.No value was provided for the shotgun.[9]On November 19, 2012, the stealing continued with $13.00 being stolen\nfrom two vehicles.Mr. Neault and his co-accused again found two rifles locked\nin a vehicle.They broke in and stole the rifles, one being a .22 calibre and\nthe other a Browning lever action (no calibre given) equipped with a scope,\nwith a combined valued of $1,700.00.Mr. Neault took them home and hid them\nwith the shotgun. Also taken was a backpack, knives, two boxes of .22 calibre\nammunition, a spotting scope and range finder all valued at approximately\n$930.00.[10]Mr. Neault let it be known to others that he wanted to sell the\nfirearms.On November 21, 2012, a buyer met Mr. Neault and purchased the three\nfirearms for $300.00.According to Mr. Neault, the buyer was aware the\nfirearms were stolen and that the sale was unlawful.[11]On December 8, 2012, Mr. Neault continued to steal items, being two GPS\nsystems and $80.00 in cash from two vehicles.On December 11, 2012 he stole\n$40.00 from two vehicles.[12]The police investigation led to Mr. Neault, and on December 19, 2012,\nMr. Neault provided a statement to the police implicating another young man in\nthe break and enter and theft of the firearms.The police investigated further\nand found that person was not involved with the thefts.On December 20, 2012,\nMr. Neault admitted to police that he had lied about the young man’s involvement and was just\ntrying to get him into trouble as they had a previous disagreement.By this\npoint the co-accused had provided information implicating Mr. Neault, and Mr.\nNeault then admitted his own involvement.[13]The firearms have not yet been recovered although the person who\npurchased them has been charged.[14]Before venturing into the constitutionality of the mandatory and minimum\nsentence in s. 99(2) of the Criminal Code, I must first determine if a\nsentence of three years or more is appropriate.If such a sentence is\nappropriate in the circumstances, then the constitutionality of the provision\nis academic.CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE ACCUSED[15]A Pre-Sentence Report (PSR) was prepared in this matter.Mr. Neault\nadvised that as a child his family was transient but he did not experience any\nproblems or abuse.He did not know his biological father while growing up, but\ndid reconnect with him at age 18.His stepfather appears to have been a\npositive influence, but that relationship broke down when his mother and\nstepfather ended the relationship.He has a close relationship with his four\nsiblings, but has not seen his two stepsisters in the last 4 or 5 years.He\nhas positive support from others, especially his girlfriend of 18 months.She\ndoes not use drugs or alcohol nor does she have any criminal involvement.[16]Mr. Neault’s\nwork history is sporadic and he has been fired from jobs for not attending hisscheduled shifts.He was unemployed at the time of the offences and is\ncurrently unemployed.He has some physical health issues as a result of falls\nin 2012 but is not on medication.However, during argument, counsel for Mr.\nNeault indicated that Mr. Neault has been diagnosed with Attention Deficit\nHyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and does take medication for it.There was no\nindication when that diagnosis occurred or how long he has been taking\nmedication.[17]He identified that he has experimented with illicit drugs since he was\n13 and has used alcohol since the age of 17.While he has tried cocaine,\ncrystal methamphetamine, MDMA and ecstasy, his drug of choice is marihuana,\nwhich he used every two or three days since the age of 13.He advises he was\nconsuming drugs and alcohol during some of the offences, but has not used drugs\nor alcohol since his release on conditions on December 24, 2012.His family have\nvoiced concerns about his drinking, but Mr. Neault does not view it as\nproblematic, even though he admits his longest period of sobriety since he\nstarted drinking was 7 months (that being the time he has been on release\nconditions).However, during submissions, counsel for Mr. Neault advised the\nCourt that Mr. Neault will take drug and alcohol counselling if ordered to do\nso and will comply with any order not to consume drugs or alcohol.[18]At page 9 of the PSR it notes: “Jessie\nstated his motivation for his current offences was for financial gain to pay\nfor food, rent and outstanding bills.When Jessie was asked if he felt crime\nwas wrong or not, he stated, “that\nis a tricky question”.He feels without crime it would be a perfect world, but with crime it keeps the\nworld balanced.In his opinion, crime is “bad” but there are reasons for\npeople to commit crimes.”The report noted that while Jessie stated his peers are not involved in\ncriminal activity, of the peers he identified, two were his co-accused.[19]The Saskatchewan Primary Risk Assessment placed Mr. Neault’s overall risk for general\nre-offending as being high.He was assessed as being at the 86th\npercentile which means 14% of Saskatchewan offenders were assessed as having\nmore risk factors.His major risk factors are: peers and companions, residence\ninstability, substance abuse, attitude, unemployment, financial difficulties\nand a lack of self management.Mitigating Factors[20]In mitigation, Mr. Neault is a 20 year old young man who entered timely\npleas of guilty to these offences.[21]Mr. Neault has a minimal criminal record which is comprised of a\nprevious conviction as a youth in 2009 where he was granted a six month\nconditional discharge for theft under $5,000.00.His only conviction as an\nadult was on June 4, 2013, for possession of a weapon dangerous to the public\npeace contrary to s. 88 of the Criminal Code for which he was sentenced\nto four months probation.While he completed the period of probation, he re-offended\nby committing these offences approximately one and a half months after his\nperiod of probation ended.Aggravating Factors[22]Mr. Neault committed the offences for financial gain.[23]He stole three firearms and returned them to his residence where he hid\nthem.[24]It was Mr. Neault who actively sought buyer(s) for the firearms.[25]Mr. Neault and the buyer met at Mr. Neault’s\nresidence and negotiated the sale.Both knew the firearms were stolen and that\nMr. Neault was not able to lawfully transfer them.[26]The firearms were not recovered.[27]He did not admit his responsibility easily, but rather misled the police\nand implicated an innocent person in a serious criminal matter, simply because\nhe was upset with that person.[28]After stealing and hiding the firearms and negotiating their sale, Mr.\nNeault continued to steal items from other vehicles.His criminal behaviour\nwould have continued but for police intervention.Gladue Factors[29]There are no Gladue factors to consider.PRINCIPLES OF SENTENCING[30]The purpose and principles of sentencing are set out in s. 718, 718.1\nand 718.2 of the Criminal Code:718.\nThe fundamental purpose of sentencing is to contribute, along with crime\nprevention initiatives, to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just,\npeaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions that have one or more of\nthe following objectives:(a) to denounce unlawful conduct;(b) to deter the offender and other persons from\ncommitting offences;(c) to separate offenders from society, where\nnecessary;(d) to assist in rehabilitating offenders;(e) to provide reparations for harm done to victims\nor to the community; and(f) to promote a sense of responsibility in\noffenders, and acknowledgment of the harm done to victims and to the community.718.1\nA sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree\nof responsibility of the offender.[31]As noted in R. v. Christensen, 2012 BCPC 374 (CanLII), at paragraph 10:The\noverarching duty of a trial judge is to apply all legitimate principles of\nsentencing to determine a “just\nand appropriate sentence”\nwhich reflects the gravity of the offence committed and the moral\nblameworthiness of the offender (R. v. C.A.M., 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC),\n(1996) 105 C.C.C. (3d) 327).Section 99[32]As the constitutionality of section 99 of the Criminal Code is\nbeing challenged, I shall first consider the appropriate sentence for\ntrafficking in firearms without consideration of the three year minimum\nsentence mandated.If, after applying the general principles of sentencing to\nthis offence and this offender, I find the appropriate sentence is three years\nor more, the constitutionality issue will become academic.(See Christensen,\nsupra, at para. 13.)[33]Section 99 of the Criminal Code appears in Part III: Firearms and\nother Weapons, under the heading “Trafficking\nOffences”.As\nobserved by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Grant, 2009 SCC 32 (CanLII), at\npara. 147, “Firearms\ntrafficking offences are extremely serious, carrying substantial penalties.”[34]Neither counsel provided any case law from Saskatchewan concerning\nsentences for charges under s. 99 or offences involving trafficking in or\npossession for the purpose of trafficking in firearms.There are a number of\nother cases involving carrying a weapon (a firearm) dangerous to the public\npeace or carrying a loaded firearm, but these are not helpful as it is one\nthing to have possession of a firearm and quite another to traffick in\nfirearms.Counsel have filed cases from other jurisdictions which provide some\nguidance.[35]Firearms offences concern both the Court and the community at large as\nthey are inherently dangerous.The strict regulation of the purchase and sale\nof firearms is necessary to protect the public and guard against the illegal\nsale and distribution of firearms.[36]In Christensen, supra, the accused was sentenced to four\nyears imprisonment after being found guilty on a number of firearm offences\nincluding possession of a prohibited firearm with readily accessible ammunition\n(s. 95(1)) and offering to transfer firearms (s. 100) which carried mandatory\nminimum sentences of three years and maximum sentences of ten years.As the\nconstitutionality of those provisions was in issue, the sentencing judge\ndetermined a fit sentence without resort to the minimum punishment.Mr.\nChristensen was 19 years of age at the time of the offences and had no previous\ncriminal record.He had purchased firearms from a co-accused and intended to\nsell them for a profit.After crediting him with double credit for 6 months\ntime served, he was ordered to serve the remaining three years incarcerated,\nand the constitutionality issue became academic.[37]In R. v. C.L., 2012 ONCJ 413 (CanLII), a sentence of two years less a day\nwith credit for one year time served was imposed on charges of trafficking in\ncocaine, with one year consecutive for firearms trafficking as well as three\nyears probation.This case is distinguishable as the accused had offered to\nsell a .45 calibre firearm to an undercover police officer during drug\ntransactions.The Court accepted that it was a “hollow\noffer” meant to keep\nthe officer returning to purchase more drugs and that the accused did not have\nactual possession of a firearm nor did he have access to one or anyintention\nto transfer it.The Court considered that his criminal culpability was more\ndirectly connected with the sale of cocaine.[38]I agree with this observation in C.L., supra, at para. 11:...While\nfirearms in general and handguns in particular are dangerous and a pressing\npublic concern in the greater Toronto area, the hollow offer that forms the\nsubstance of this charge has to be seen to be a less serious offence than the\nactual possession of a firearm.The likelihood of danger that a firearm could\nbe used, to harm members of the public, is much higher in the case of actual\npossession of a gun, than is the offering to get one in the future, and\nparticularly so when the offerer has no intention of actually making the\nfirearm available. ...[39]In R. v. Ivanic, 2011 BCCA 158 (CanLII), the accused sold 3 restricted and\n2 prohibited firearms to an undercover police officer.He was also involved in\na shoot out when he was attacked by people he was involved with in a drug\ndeal.His minimal criminal record contained a recent conviction for\ntrafficking in drugs where he received a conditional sentence and firearm\nprohibition.He was sentenced to 8 years incarceration, but with double credit\nfor 22 months time served his cumulative sentence was 44 months.The sentence\nwas upheld on appeal.While Mr. Neault is not facing a sentence of that\nmagnitude, these comments of the Court at para. 21 are applicable:[21]\n... Offences involving firearms and the sale of firearms are serious matters\nand sentences need to reflect society’s\ncondemnation against those who participate in such activities.DECISION[40]Mr. Neault has a limited criminal record, but does have a recent\nconviction for a weapons related offence.His moral culpability is high.He\nparticipated in the theft of three firearms and other items from vehicles,\nmotivated by financial gain.Mr. Neault took the initiative to locate a buyer\nand successfully arranged the sale of the firearms to another person.While\ncounsel for Mr. Neault argued that the guns were sold to a local resident, not\nto a known criminal organization or gang member, that is immaterial in my\nopinion.The fact remains he stole and then sold firearms.[41]The degree of planning and deliberation is also a factor in determining\nthe severity of the offence (See Christensen, supra, at para. 22).Mr.\nNeault may have stumbled upon the firearms in the sense that he was not\nspecifically seeking them during his break and entry into automobiles.He did\nhowever, hide the firearms and then actively seek a buyer, which involved him\ntalking to others.One of these people provided the name of the buyer and the\nsale occurred rather quickly.This ability to turn the guns quickly into\nfinancial gain, although not requiring a lot of sophisticated planning,places\nthe offence toward the middle of the scale.[42]Mr. Neault lacks insight into his own behaviour and has a simplistic\nview of how to avoid criminal behaviour.He initially failed to recognize his\nalcohol and drug issues, but now, belatedly, admits drug and alcohol use is an\nissue that he is willing to address.The attitude that comes through in the\nPSR is one of an immature young man who cannot maintain employment and seeks\nwhat he perceives to be an easy way out of financial difficulties by committing\nserious criminal offences.He does not seem to appreciate the gravity of the\nfirearm offences.As noted in Christensen, supra, at paragraph 23,\ncrimes committed for financial gain garner higher sentences.[43]A significant period of incarceration is warranted to denounce in the\nstrongest terms Mr. Neault’s\nconduct in stealing and then trafficking in firearms.Specific and general\ndeterrence also must be stressed to ensure Mr. Neault does not find criminal\nbehaviour appealing, or a justifiable response to financial difficulties.Similarly, the threat of a penitentiary sentence is necessary to ensure others\ndo not travel down this path.[44]In this case, while there is hope for rehabilitation of Mr. Neault, that\nprinciple is not at the forefront.He continued with a pattern of criminal\nbehaviour that included repeated thefts, stealing firearms, trafficking in\nfirearms and culminating with obstructing justice by blaming an innocent\nperson.[45]Without considering the three year minimum sentence for the offence of\ntrafficking in firearms, I find a fit sentence for Mr. Neault is three years.Such a sentence addresses the seriousness with which trafficking in firearms\noffences are treated by Parliament and other courts.It speaks to society’s condemnation and serves\nas a warning to others that such dangerous criminal behaviour will be visited\nby lengthy periods of incarceration.[46]Further, the offence of breaking and entering into a vehicle and\nstealing firearms contrary to s. 98 (1)(b) of the Criminal Code carries\na maximum penalty of life imprisonment.Neither counsel filed any case law.It may be argued that this offence is at least as serious as the trafficking in\nfirearms, although it does not carry a minimum sentence.The availability of\nlife imprisonment underscores the seriousness of stealing firearms and sends a\nstrong message of deterrence.Nothing short of a period of incarceration of at\nleast three years is warranted even for a first offence for an offender with no\ncriminal record.Anything less fails to address denunciation and deterrence in\nthe widest sense.[47]Mr. Neault spent four days on remand prior to his release on conditions\nin December 2012.I will credit those four days on Count 11.In all of the\ncircumstances, and taking into account Mr. Neault’s\nguilty pleas, and considering the totality principle, I sentence Mr. Neault to\nthe following:Count\n6:trafficking in firearms contrary to s. 99(2) of the Criminal Code -\n3 years incarceration;Count\n1:break and enter a motor vehicle and steal a firearm contrary to s. 98(1)(b)\n- 3 years incarceration concurrent;Count\n11:commit public mischief with intent to mislead a peace officer contrary to\ns. 140(1)(a) of the Criminal Code - 124 days minus the 4 days spent on\nremand, results in 120 days incarceration consecutive to Count 6 but concurrent\nto all other charges;Count\n2:theft of currency of a value not exceeding five thousand dollars contrary\nto s. 334(b) of the Criminal Code - two months incarceration concurrent\nto all charges;Count\n7:steal a GPS system and Canadian currency of a value not exceeding five\nthousand dollars contrary to s. 334(b) of the Criminal Code - three\nmonths incarceration concurrent to all charges.[48]I will hear submissions from counsel concerning collateral orders and\nsurcharges.CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUE[49]Having found a fit sentence is three years incarceration for trafficking\nin firearms pursuant to section 99(2) of the Criminal Code, the\nconstitutional challenge to the mandatory minimum sentence of three years\nincarceration is academic and will not be further considered.I.\nCardinal, J"}

Furthermore, this is not a case of production of cannabis for\nmedical reasons.[2]None of the appellant’s submissions before us\nsuggest that the judge was mistaken in these views.[3]The Court is of the opinion that the appeal is\nfrivolous and should be summarily dismissed.FOR THE FOREGOING REASONS, THE COURT:[4]GRANTS the motion\nto dismiss;[5]DISMISSES the\nappeal.In respect of the sentence:[6]At paragraph [10] of his reasons, the sentencing\njudge concluded, after a careful weighing of the relevant factors, that a\nprison sentence of six months was just and reasonable in the circumstances. His\nconclusion and the reasons given are unimpeachable given the applicable\nstandards of review on appeal.[7]The Court notes that the question as to the\nunconstitutionality of the statutory minimum sentence was not raised at first\ninstance and no evidence was led to sustain the appellant’s current\nsubmissions.[8]In any event, the sentence imposed coincides\nwith the statutory minimum sentence fixed par Parliament to this offence. The\njudge took note of that fact, but observed that the six-month sentence he\nimposed «aurait été raisonnable sans égard au minimum prescrit par la loi»\n(paragraph [10]). We agree. In the circumstances, it is not necessary to\nconsider whether the statutory minimum sentence is constitutional.FOR THE FOREGOING REASONS THE COURT:[9]GRANTS the\nrespondent’s motion to dismiss the grounds for appeal based on the\nunconstitutionality of the minimum sentence for the offence;[10]DISMISSES the motion for leave to\nappeal;[11]ORDERS the appellant to surrender\nhimself to the prison authorities within 72 hours of this judgment.LOUIS ROCHETTE, J.A.NICHOLAS KASIRER, J.A.CLAUDE C.

(3d) 360 (NLCA).STATUTES CONSIDERED: Criminal\nCode, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46.EDITED ORAL REASONS FOR JUDGMENTStacK,\nJ.:INTRODUCTION[1]George Keeping takes his surname literally; at least he did regarding\nhis long-suffering wife, Gail.Key to his idea of a successful marriage was\nkeeping strict control over his spouse – physically, emotionally and\nfinancially.Ms. Keeping did not always suffer in silence, though.At times\nshe struck back, physically and financially.When she struck back physically,\nhe would have her charged; she has the criminal record for assault to show for\nit.When she struck back financially, he would also have her charged; she\nalready has one conviction for stealing from him and she now faces sentencing\non two more.[2]In sentencing Ms. Keeping, I must balance society’s interests in\ndenouncing her criminal conduct and in deterring her and others from engaging\nin such conduct against society’s equally important interest in rehabilitating\nthe offender so that she has the best possible prospects of a crime-free\nfuture.charges and agreed statement of\nfacts[3]On March 2, 2012, Ms. Keeping pleaded guilty to one count of theft over\n$5000 and one count of theft under $5000. Convictions were entered on both\nbased upon the agreed statement of facts that provides:On October 20, 2009 the Grand Bank Detachment\nof the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) entered into a theft\ninvestigation.George Keeping of Fortune, NL advised the police that his company,\nKeeping Enterprises, had been the victim of a series of thefts.On routine\nreview of the company’s books, Mr. Keeping’s accountant discovered multiple\ncash withdraws from automatic bank machines (ABMs) and brought it to Mr.\nKeeping’s attention.The person responsible had withdrawn cash in\nvarying amounts from the business account on numerous occasions between January\n22, 2009 to October 14, 2009.The total amount of the monies taken was\n$27,934.50.Most of the ABM withdrawals took place at the Grand Bank branch of\nScotiabank where there was a surveillance camera installed.Mr. Keeping went\nto the bank and asked that the bank check the footage from the camera against\nthe withdrawal statements to determine if there was footage of the person using\nhis debit card.The bank subsequently provided several photographs to Cst.\nMark Jenkins of the RCMP.Upon viewing the photographs, Mr. Keeping identified\nthe person making the ABM withdrawals in the photos as his wife, Gail Keeping.Mr. Keeping told the RCMP that his wife Gail\nwas not a partner in Keeping Enterprises.Mr. Keeping did not use ABM machines\nfor cash withdrawals from his business account, but rather used cheques or\npoint-of-sale transactions.On February 1, 2010, George Keeping attended the\nGrand Bank RCMP with a copy of a cheque that had been cashed.The cheque was\nfrom the Coast Guard and was made out to Mr. Keeping in the amount of $871.05.He claimed that he had never received the cheque but his name had been signed\non the back and the cheque had been cashed at Collins Fresh Mart.Mr. Keeping\ntold the RCMP that the signature on the cheque was not his own.He told police\nthat he believed Gail Keeping might have cashed the cheque without his\nknowledge and had taken the money.On February 1, 2010, Gail Keeping attended the\nGrand Bank RCMP and agreed to provide a cautioned statement to Cst. Jenkins.In her statement Gail Keeping first denied having anything to do with the\nstolen money but eventually she confessed to taking the debit card without Mr.\nKeeping’s knowledge and withdrawing money.Gail said she knew the PIN number\nbecause he had told her what it was.She was reluctant to admit that she had\nbeen withdrawing the money since January 2009, saying that she thought that she\nhad started around September 2009.She also said she did not think she had\ntaken anywhere near the total amount of money that had been stolen.She\nestimated that she had taken around $8,000-$9,000.She later stated that is\nwas possible that she had been taking the money since January 2009 and that she\nhad taken closer to the full amount but she could not remember doing so as her\nmemory was poor due to prescription drug use.With regard to the Coast Guard cheque, Gail\nKeeping admitted that she had indeed cashed the cheque.She said that Mr.\nKeeping had been sick and told her to take it and get groceries with it.She\nsaid she had bought about $500.00 worth of groceries and believed that she had\ngiven Mr. Keeping the change.She could not remember if she had signed Mr.\nKeeping’s name to the cheque or not.The RCMP subsequently charged Gail Keeping\nwith two counts of theft.sentencing in contextPre-Sentence Report and Ms.\nKeeping’s Testimony[4]The facts as set out in the Agreed Statement of Facts do not put these\ncrimes in their proper domestic context.For that, one needs to look to the Pre-Sentence\nReport and Ms. Keeping’s testimony at her sentencing hearing.The Crown has\nnot contested the facts as set out in the Pre-Sentence Report and did not subject\nMs. Keeping to a very rigorous cross-examination at the hearing.The Crown\nconcedes that Ms. Keeping’s actions were in the nature of a self-help remedy.On the facts, that is a reasonable position to take.Let me explain why.[5]Ms. Keeping is 48 years old, was born in Happy Valley-Goose Bay and is\nof Inuit descent.She had a reasonably stable upbringing in Happy Valley-Goose\nBay with her parents, who both worked at the air force base, and her 6\nsiblings.Unfortunately, she was sexually assaulted by one of her brothers\nwhen she was between 11 and 14 years old.[6]When Ms. Keeping was 17, she gave birth to a son, Brandon.Brandon was\nraised by his maternal grandparents until he turned 13 when he went to live\nwith Ms. Keeping in Fortune on the island portion of the Province.That is\nwhere Ms. Keeping moved to in 1984.The next year she married George Keeping\nand they were together for 26 years.They have two children, Christian and\nLisa, born in 1986 and 1988, respectively.[7]The Pre-Sentence Report describes a life of “physical and emotional\nabuse, fear, control and domestic violence by Mr. Keeping”.One assault caused\nher to miscarry, another caused an injury to her back from which she still\nsuffers chronic pain.He threw a pot of hot soup at her, pushed her down the\nstairs, hauled her by the hair and smacked her in the face.Mr. Keeping called\nher “Eskimo”, fat, stupid and ugly, but said that if he could not have her no\none would and he would shoot her.He treated Brandon differently than he\ntreated his own children.[8]Although Ms. Keeping worked in the family fishing enterprise for 18\nyears, Mr. Keeping controlled her money.Sometimes he would pay her half of it\nand expect her to pay the bills and buy groceries and other necessities with\nthe rest.Other times he would make her endorse her cheques over to him.Still other times she was not paid at all.Ms. Keeping was told that 20% of\nthe business was in her name but later found that this was not true.[9]Ms. Keeping finally left her husband in 2004, but went back with him for\nmost of the period until February of 2010.In her evidence she stated that she\nfinally left when she felt that the children were able to live on their own.[10]The parties entered into a Separation Agreement dated November 29, 2004.\nThe Separation Agreement acknowledged that Mr. Keeping had the higher income;\nnevertheless, Ms. Keeping was not paid spousal support.There was a division\nof matrimonial property, however, and among the amounts due to Ms. Keeping from\nher husband was $600 per month for 10 years.Mr. Keeping made only one of those\npayments.It is important to note that although the Separation Agreement\nprovided that any spousal or child support would cease during a period of resumed\ncohabitation, payments for division of property would not.Consequently, Mr.\nKeeping was required to pay Ms. Keeping the $600 per month until December 1,\n2014, even though she resumed living with him until 2010.[11]At the time of the thefts for which she is now being sentenced, Brandon\nwas in a hard way financially.He and his four children were living in a place\nwith no heat.Ms. Keeping bought groceries for them, diapers for the children and\nother necessities.She did the same for Christian’s child and for Lisa’s\nchild.Ms. Keeping had no income of her own that year.Mr. Keeping took her\nname off the employment roll and as a result she did not qualify for Employment\nInsurance.He said he would give her money, but did not.[12]In the first instance of theft, Ms. Keeping took her husband’s bank card\nand, because she knew the PIN, could make withdrawals.The card was in his\nname and she did not know that the account from which she took the money was a\ncorporate account.The second instance involved cashing a cheque that was in\nMr. Keeping’s name at the grocery store.[13]Ms. Keeping has a long history of psychiatric health issues.After she\ngot involved with Mr. Keeping she suffered a “nervous breakdown” and had to be\nhospitalized.On at least three occasions she overdosed on pills.She is\ncurrently under the care of Dr. David Collins for “major depression” for which\nshe is prescribed medication.She has had a Percocet addiction.She has been\nreferred for counseling through the Nunatsiavut Government of which she is a\nbeneficiary.[14]Ms. Keeping has a grade 9 education and, despite encouragement from the\nprobation officer, does not think that she is smart enough for Adult Basic\nEducation.She worked in her husband’s fishing enterprise from April to\nOctober for 18 years and then in the fish plant in the winters.Most recently,\nshe was employed at NorthMart in Happy Valley-Goose Bay.A very positive\nletter from her employer was entered as an exhibit at the sentencing hearing.Unfortunately, she left that job for a higher paying opportunity fishing that\ndid not work out.At the time of the sentencing hearing she was looking to get\nback on at NorthMart or with a cleaning company that pays $4.00 an hour more.[15]Ms.Keeping is living in another relationship now and has\naccommodations on the Goose Bay air force base.[16]Importantly, Ms. Keeping has made full restitution to Mr. Keeping and\nhis company through the proceeds of a family law action that she commenced to\nrecover the monies owing to her under the Separation Agreement.Victim Impact Statement[17]In his victim impact statement, Mr. Keeping says that these crimes\nplaced him in a state of shock and caused him depression, exacerbating his\nexisting panic attacks.He also says that the loss of the money adversely\naffected his fishing enterprise.Finally, he says that his sense of trust has\nbeen shattered by his wife of 25 years doing these things.Criminal Record[18]Ms. Keeping has a record consisting of two thefts, two breaches of\nrecognizance, a failure to comply with a probation order, an assault and an assault\nwith a weapon.Of note is the assault with a weapon which, according to her,\nand undisputed by the Crown, occurred when her husband threatened to smash a\nphotograph of her late, cherished father and she chased him away with a\nhammer.The thefts, she says, occurred when Mr. Keeping would not give her the\nmoney she needed to maintain the household; in respect of the most recent theft,\nrestitution was ordered for $52.92.Positions of the PartiesThe Crown[19]Crown counsel acknowledges that this was a crime of “self-help”. Ms.\nKeeping took from her husband some of what he should have paid her under the\nSeparation Agreement.Yet the Crown submits that, given Ms. Keeping’s criminal\nrecord, this is not a suitable case for a conditional discharge.He points to\nthe premeditation and pattern disclosed by the crimes.The range of sentences\nis from a discharge to a period of incarceration.Because of these unique\nfacts, the Crown says that there are no cases that provide guidance (I point\nout, however, that there are almost always cases to be found on point and,\nalthough a case may not be readily found that is “on all fours” with the case\nat Bar, there are always instructive cases to be found at the appellate level\nthat will provide guidance to the sentencing judge; the empty-handed counsel\nrisks a decision adverse to his submissions and, worse, one that may be\ncontrary to the law).Although Ms. Keeping poses no risk to the community at\nlarge, the Crown submits that sentencing must reflect denunciation and deterrence.Because of her record, a discharge in this case would be a step backwards.A\nconditional sentence for three months was recommended.The Defence[20]The Defence, however, says that a conditional discharge is precisely\nappropriate here because the dominant sentencing principle should not be\ndeterrence, but rehabilitation.Ms. Keeping sought to plead guilty as soon as\npossible and was only prevented from doing so earlier because the family law\nmatter had to be first resolved in order to facilitate restitution.That is,\nMs. Keeping was able to repay Mr. Keeping and his company in full with money\nthat he owed her under the Separation Agreement.[21]Ms. Keeping is settled back in Happy Valley-Goose Bay where she has\nfamily support and the prospects of employment.Her biggest fear is that a\nfresh criminal record for theft will thwart her attempts to secure employment.Employment is central to her new-found independence and prospects for a\nsuccessful future.[22]The question implied by the Defence is, in these unique circumstances,\ndo I let the important principles of denunciation and deterrence potentially\ncountervail a successful rehabilitation?It is important to note that the\nCrown is not seeking a sentence to be served in jail.The distinction is\nwhether Ms. Keeping will be certain to have a criminal record stemming from\nthese crimes or whether she will acquire one only if she does not abide by her\nconditions of discharge.[23]The Defence cited one case, the 2010 decision of Gorman, P.C.J., in R.\nv. Kelly, 2010 CanLII 44697 (NL PC), 2010 CanLII 44697 (NLPC).There the offender stole from two\nretailers, the second being his employer.The first theft was of sundry\nconsumer items; the second was $82.55 worth of food.Mr. Kelly had no previous\nrecord.The only impediment that Judge Gorman saw to imposing a discharge was\nthat in the second instance, Mr. Kelly stole from his employer and it was\nsuggested that a discharge was not appropriate where there was a breach of\ntrust.[24]Following a thorough analysis, Judge Gorman looked at the small amount of\nfood that was stolen and that the theft was not for financial gain but for\nnecessities.He was satisfied that for that offender, who had no previous\nrecord, rehabilitation should be the primary sentencing goal, notwithstanding\nthe breach of trust.A conditional discharge was granted.The Law Regarding Discharges[25]For Ms. Keeping to be discharged, she must satisfy me that two hurdles\ncan be overcome.The first is that a significant amount of money was taken;\nthe second is that Ms. Keeping has a prior criminal record.Let me review some\nof the law in this area to better explain why these are important\nconsiderations.[26]The ability to grant a discharge is provided by section 730 of the Criminal\nCode:730. (1) Where\nan accused … pleads guilty to or is found guilty of an offence … the court\nbefore which the accused appears may, if it considers it to be in the best\ninterests of the accused and not contrary to the public interest, instead of\nconvicting the accused, by order direct that the accused be discharged absolutely\nor on the conditions prescribed in a probation order …(3) Where a court directs under\nsubsection (1) that an offender be discharged of an offence, the offender shall\nbe deemed not to have been convicted of the offence …(4) Where an offender who is bound by the\nconditions of a probation order made at a time when the offender was directed\nto be discharged under this section is convicted of an offence … the court that\nmade the probation order may … revoke the discharge, convict the offender of the\noffence to which the discharge relates and impose any sentence that could have\nbeen imposed if the offender had been convicted at the time of discharge … .[27]Section 730 has been interpreted and applied numerous times by the\ncourts, including the Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador, Court of Appeal.[28]I note at the outset that the entering of convictions following the\nguilty plea does not preclude me from substituting discharges on sentencing (R.\nv. Bartlett, 2005 NLCA 75 (CanLII)).[29]The case most often cited in respect of discharges is the British\nColumbia Court of Appeal decision in R. v. Fallofield, (1973), 13 C.C.C.\n(2d) 450. After a review of the case law, the court set out 8 factors that have\nbeen consistently considered by the courts of other provinces:From this review of the authorities and my own\nview of the meaning of s. [730], I draw the following conclusions…:(1)The\nsection may be used in respect of any offence other than an offence for which a\nminimum punishment is prescribed by law or the offence is punishable by\nimprisonment for 14 years or for life … .(2)The\nsection contemplates the commission of an offence. There is nothing in the\nlanguage that limits it to a technical or trivial violation.(3)Of\nthe two conditions precedent to the exercise of the jurisdiction, the first is\nthat the Court must consider that it is in the best interests of the accused\nthat he should be discharged either absolutely or upon condition. If it is not\nin the best interests of the accused, that, of course, is the end of the\nmatter. If it is decided that it is in the best interests of the accused, then\nthat brings the next consideration into operation.(4)The\nsecond condition precedent is that the Court must consider that a grant of\ndischarge is not contrary to the public interest.(5)Generally,\nthe first condition would presuppose that the accused is a person of good\ncharacter, without previous conviction, that it is not necessary to enter a\nconviction against him in order to deter him from future offences or to rehabilitate\nhim, and that the entry of a conviction against him may have significant\nadverse repercussions.(6)In\nthe context of the second condition the public interest in the deterrence of\nothers, while it must be given due weight, does not preclude the judicious use\nof the discharge provisions.(7)The\npowers given by s. [730] should not be exercised as an alternative to probation\nor suspended sentence.(8)Section\n[730] should not be applied routinely to any particular offence. This may\nresult in an apparent lack of uniformity in the application of the discharge\nprovisions. This lack will be more apparent than real and will stem from the\ndifferences in the circumstances of cases.Good\nCharacter:Effect of Previous Convictions[30]When considering whether discharge would be in the best interests of the\noffender, there is generally an assumption that the offender “is a person of\ngood character, without previous conviction…”. If having no previous conviction\nis a prerequisite for a discharge, then Ms. Keeping does not qualify.But is\nthere a rigid rule in this regard?Such a rule runs counter to the purpose of\nsection 730, which is to give the sentencing judge discretion to consider the\ncircumstances of the offender and of the offence in making a determination,\nthat is, to determine proportionality.Inflexible considerations should not be\nat play.The issue is whether the offender is a person of good character,\nwhich would normally imply that she has no previous conviction.But that is\nonly one factor to be considered.[31]In R. v. Elsharawy, 1997 CanLII 14708 (NL CA), 1997 CanLII 14708 (NLCA), our Court of Appeal\ngives life to this more elastic view ofsection 730 when it describes the best\ninterests of the offender as presupposing:…that the accused is a person of good\ncharacter usually without previous conviction or discharge, that he does\nnot require personal deterrence or rehabilitation and that a criminal\nconviction may have significant adverse repercussions. [Emphasis added][32]Thus, a previous conviction is not a bar to a discharge, but it will be\nan unusual case where a person with a previous conviction will be discharged.[33]I note, for clarity, that it is not only previous convictions\nthat apply to the assessment of the offender’s character under section 730.Because the information is being used for that purpose only and not for seeking\na more severe sentence, the timing of the other event or events is not\nimportant.It is simply evidence of the character of the offender that is\nadmissible for the purpose of the character analysis under section 730 (Elsharawy\nat paragraph 4).Good\nCharacter:Need for Rehabilitation[34]One other of the elements in the passage quoted from Elsharawy\nbears mention as well.It states a person of good character is presumed not to\nrequire rehabilitation.I read that as rehabilitation that can be provided by\nway of other sentencing alternatives, such as incarceration (see R. v.\nSanchez-Pino, (1973), 1973 CanLII 794 (ON CA), 11 C.C.C. (2d) 53 (ONCA) at paragraph 17).Where the\noffender’s chances of successful rehabilitation are in part contingent on the\ndischarge itself, then to read it otherwise would be to run afoul of the last\npart of the above quotation from Elsharawy, i.e. “that a criminal\nconviction may have significant adverse repercussions”.One of those adverse\nrepercussions may be interference with the rehabilitation of the offender.Not\nContrary to the Public Interest[35]The Court of Appeal also provides guidance on the second component of\nthe test, that the discharge not be contrary to the public interest.The sentencing\njudge must consider the principle of general deterrence, specifically with\nregard to the gravity of the offence, its incidence in the community, public\nattitudes toward it and public confidence in the effective enforcement of the\ncriminal law (Elsharawy at paragraph 3).analysisSection 718.2(e) of the Criminal\nCode[36]I have considered section 718.2(e) of the Criminal Code by which\nI am to consider all reasonable sanctions other than imprisonment, especially\nfor aboriginal offenders.Neither the Crown nor the Defence drew particular\nattention to how Ms. Keeping’s aboriginal status has led her to her present\ncircumstances.This may have been because the Crown is not seeking\nimprisonment for Ms. Keeping.Nevertheless, her status as an Inuk woman forms\npart of her history that I have described above and is therefore part of her\nantecedents that I have considered in imposing sentence.I have considered it\nin balancing the gravity of the offences against the degree of responsibility\nof the offender; I have attempted to balance the principles of denunciation and\ndeterrence with that of rehabilitation so as to promote “the maintenance of a\njust, peaceful and safe society” while at the same time ensuring justice for\nthe offender (R. v. Ipeelee,\n2012 SCC 13 (CanLII), [2012] S.C.J. No. 13 at paragraphs 36 and 37).Here, however, Ms.\nKeeping’s Inuk heritage appears to play less of a role in her circumstances\nthan does her status as a victim of domestic abuse.Unfortunately the two are\nrelated, as are her mental health issues, substance abuse and lack of\nself-esteem.These are not Trivial Crimes[37]Ms. Keeping, it is true, stole a significant amount of money from Mr.\nKeeping and his company.Discharges are not, however, confined to technical or\ntrivial violations (Fallofield at paragraph 21).It could be argued\nthat it was money to which she was entitled in that her husband had not made\nmore than the first $600 monthly payment under the Separation Agreement.The\ncourt does not condone crimes for self-help, but here Ms. Keeping needed the\nmoney for her upkeep and for the upkeep of her grandchildren.In R. v.\nProwse, 1998 CanLII 18024 (NL CA), 1998 CanLII 18024 (NLCA), a conditional discharge was ordered where\nthe accused stole a Honda generator as part of an ongoing monetary dispute\nbetween the appellant and the complainant.Although what Ms. Keeping did was a\ncrime, in these circumstances I would not let the amount of money deter me from\ngranting a discharge.This is particularly so because full restitution has\nbeen made (R. v. Montgrand, 2008 SKCA 50 (CanLII) at paragraph 11).Is Ms. Keeping of Good Character?[38]Ms. Keeping’s criminal record is another matter.To be granted a\ndischarge Ms. Keeping must demonstrate that she is of good character.As we\nsaw above, this means “usually without a criminal record”.But how does one\ncompare the character of Ms. Keeping with that of the former Irish Christian\nBrother in R. v. Burke, 1996 CanLII 11083 (NL CA), 1996, 108 C.C.C. (3d) 360 (NLCA)?He had no\ncriminal record but was initially convicted of assault causing bodily harm\nagainst a student.I would have thought that the offence itself spoke to his\ncharacter.Nevertheless, the passage of 20 years and a great number of letters\nin support of Mr. Burke led the Court of Appeal to grant a discharge.[39]In Montgrand, notwithstanding the other considerations that would\nincline towards leniency (guilty plea, full restitution, support from the\nvictim, employment and the cessation of alcohol consumption), the 25 year old\noffender’s 51 prior criminal convictions led the court to convict him and\nimpose a fine of $500.Mr. Montgrand had been charged with mischief and\ncausing property damage in excess of $5000.[40]What were Ms. Keeping’s previous crimes?They were not trivial and\nshould not be minimized.But, they occurred in the same unfortunate domestic\ncircumstances that led to the ones for which she is being sentenced today. She\nstole money from her husband to buy necessities and chased him with a hammer\nwhen he threatened to destroy the photograph of her father.Ms. Keeping’s crimes\nappear to be confined to her abusive marriage.They may demonstrate poor\njudgment and impulsiveness, but I am not satisfied that they demonstrate bad\ncharacter to the extent that she should be deprived of the benefits of a\ndischarge.The\nTests in s.730:Best Interests of the Offender and not contrary to the Public Interest[41]Is it in Ms. Keeping’s interest that she be granted a discharge?Yes,\nfor the reasons stated above.She has finally begun a new life here in Happy\nValley-Goose Bay.Her matrimonial legal issues are behind her.She is in a\nnew relationship.Now she needs to resume employment in order to establish a\ndegree of financial independence. This is key to her rehabilitation. Two new\ntheft convictions could interfere with that.[42]Can it be said that a discharge in these circumstances is “not contrary\nto the public interest”?That is more problematical, because denunciation and\ngeneral deterrence are important principles.As noted by the Court of Appeal in\nBurke, however, inherent in the fact of being charged and going through\nthe criminal trial process culminating in a guilty plea is a component of\ndenunciation and deterrence.Specific deterrence is not required here because\nMs. Keeping is not, as the Crown conceded, a risk to the community at large.Because these offences arise out of a matrimonial property dispute, the money\nwas taken to purchase necessities, Ms. Keeping has pleaded guilty and full\nrestitution has been made, public confidence in the administration of criminal\nlaw can be maintained through the imposition of appropriate conditions.[43]Ms. Keeping will not have gotten off “scot-free”; she will be subject to\na period of probation as a condition of her discharge.If she breaches the\nprobation, then she can lose the benefit of the discharges and be convicted of\nthese offences.Is that not the better way to address the public interest\nhere?The public has an interest in the rehabilitation of Ms. Keeping; if she\nabides by the conditions imposed upon her that interest can be achieved.The\npublic also has an interest in the blameworthy being sentenced in a manner that\ndenounces their crimes and deters others from committing similar crimes; if Ms.\nKeeping does not abide by her terms of probation, then convictions can be\nentered and this principle will be honoured.sentence[44]Discharges are granted sparingly.Rarely will one be granted where a\nsignificant amount of money was stolen and the offender has a criminal record,\nespecially for both violent and property crimes.This is one of those rare\ncases.The factors that make a conditional discharge appropriate here are:•the antecedents of the offender;•the money taken was less than was owed to her by the complainant\nunder the 2004 Separation Agreement;•the stolen money was used to purchase necessities;•the offender pleaded guilty at the first opportunity;•full restitution was made;•the offender’s previous criminal record also arose out of her\ntroubled domestic relationship; and•further convictions for theft may interfere with the offender’s\nemployment prospects thereby depriving her of her best chance of\nrehabilitation.[45]Ms. Keeping, please stand.I substitute conditional discharges on both\ncounts with supervised probation for six months on count #1 for breach of\nsection 334(a), and six months supervised probation, concurrent on count #2,\nfor breach of section 334(b).The conditions of probation are that you are to:1)Keep the peace and be of good behaviour;2)Report to a probation officer today and thereafter as required;3)Report any change in your name, address or occupation to your probation\nofficer; and4)Attend and actively participate in any counseling programs as\nrecommended by your probation officer._____________________________Robert P.

Michael Buchinskifor\nthe offender__________________________________________________________________________SENTENCING JUDGMENTPOPESCUL\nC.J.Q.B.April 15, 2016__________________________________________________________________________I.INTRODUCTION[1]The offender, Justin\nGryba [offender], who is 27 years of age, was arrested on November 23, 2011 and\ncharged with several child pornography related offences. He was released from\ncustody and ultimately plead guilty to one count of making child pornography\navailable and one count of possessing child pornography. On January 21, 2013,\nafter accepting a joint submission, a Provincial Court judge sentenced him to two\nyears less one day in custody, followed by three years probation.[2]At the sentencing\nhearing before the Provincial Court judge the Crown referred to numerous images\nof child pornography found on the offender’s computer. The Crown made it clear,\nhowever, that it was unable to access two “DataLocker” external hard drives\nwith military grade encryption features found in the offender’s possession and\nthat whatever may be subsequently found on those hard drives formed no part of\nthe sentencing process that took place in Provincial Court at that time. The\nCrown warned that continued efforts would be made to access the hard drives and\nthat, if and when, the DataLocker hard drives were decrypted, the offender\nwould face further charges.[3]The police eventually gained\naccess to the offender’s DataLocker hard drives. More child pornography was\nfound and, as warned, more child pornography related charges were laid. As a\nresult, on September 17, 2014, the offender, who had already been released on\nparole, was once again arrested. He has been in custody ever since.[4]The offender plead autrefois\nacquit and autrefois convict with respect to the new charges. He\nargued that the basis for the new charges is the same as the old charges and that\nhe ought not be tried again for the same thing. I found that the offender had\nfailed to establish the basis for the special pleas of autrefois acquit\nand autrefois convict and put him to his election. See R v Gryba,\n2015 SKQB 372 (CanLII) [Gryba].[5]The offender has now\nentered a plea of guilty to four of the seven counts contained in the\nindictment. The Crown intends to stay the other three charges at the conclusion\nof the sentencing process.[6]Sentencing submissions\nhave been made and it is now up to the court to pass a just and appropriate\nsentence.II.PRELIMINARY COMMENTS[7]Sentencing one’s fellow\nman is one of the most important and difficult tasks judges are called upon to\nperform. At the sentencing stage the Crown will have proven what it has alleged\nbeyond a reasonable doubt or, as in this case, the offender will have admitted\nguilt by pleading guilty. The presumption of innocence has been displaced. The\noffender is, in fact and in law, guilty.[8]The issue now facing\nthe court is this: what is the appropriate sentence to be imposed upon this\noffender for these crimes in this community. In crafting the\nappropriate sentence the court must have regard for all of the factors set out\nin the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, the personal circumstances of\nthe offender and the nature of the offences committed. Guidance can be obtained\nfrom the jurisprudence; however, no two cases are exactly the same and the\nsentencing process is a highly individualized process. Accordingly, as the\nSupreme Court of Canada said in R v Ipeelee, 2012 SCC 13 (CanLII), at para 38, [2012]\n1 SCR 433, “Sentencing judges must have sufficient manoeuvrability to tailor\nsentences to the circumstances of the particular offence and the particular\noffender.”[9]Invariably, sentencing\njudges attract criticism regardless of the result. Some will say – however\nharsh the sentence – that it is not harsh enough. This is understandable. The\nimposition of a sentence can never perfectly right a wrong. Others will say –\nhowever lenient the sentence – that the sentence is too severe. What good does\nit do to send a potentially rehabilitatable offender to jail, at great cost to\nthe state, where the end product can often be an individual more hardened and\ncorrupted than the person that entered the institution?[10]Such is the lot of a\nsentencing judge. Despite these tensions, the sentencing judge must nonetheless\nstrive to craft the best possible sentence that achieves the goals set forth by\nParliament in the Criminal Code.[11]While Canadian courts\ndo not impose sentences in response to public clamour or in a spirit of\nrevenge, sentences are not imposed in a vacuum. The punishment inflicted for\ngrave crimes should reflect society’s revulsion such that sentences, by and\nlarge, should have the support of reasonably informed, concerned and right\nthinking citizens. See R v Oliver, [1977] 5 WWR 344 (BCCA). While some\nperceive the imposition of a sentence by a judge as a wielding of power, those\nexercising that function perceive it more as an exercise of immense\nresponsibility.III.CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENCES[12]An online investigation\nof a file sharing network named “GigaTribe” led to the execution of a search\nwarrant at the offender’s residence on November 23, 2011. The police seized\na tower computer, a laptop computer and two DataLocker hard drives.[13]The police examined the\ntwo computers and found approximately 3,000 child pornography files. The files\nwere predominantly still images, but also included videos. As a result of this\ndiscovery, the offender was charged with several child pornography related\noffences. The specific details were fully set out in my decision respecting autrefois\nacquit/convict. See Gryba at paras 4-9.[14]On January 21, 2013 the\noffender plead guilty to Counts 2 and 3 after which the Crown stayed Counts 1\nand 4. Counts 2 and 3 as set forth in the informationare as follows:(2)between the 31st day of August,\nA.D. 2011 and the 8th day of September, A.D. 2011 at or near\nSASKATOON, SASKATCHEWAN didCommit\nthe offence of making images of children under 18 years of age engaged in\nexplicit sexual activity and/or the focus of the image was the genital or anal\nregion of a child under 18 years of age available to other internet users,\ncontrary to Section 163.1(3) of the Criminal Code.(3)on or about the 23rd day of November,\nA.D. 2011 at or near SASKATOON, SASKATCHEWAN didHave\nin his possession child pornography to wit: Images and videos of children under\n18 years of age engaged in explicit sexual activity and/or the focus of the\nimage was the genital or anal region of the child under 18 years of age,\ncontrary to Section 163.1(4) of the Criminal Code.[15]The Provincial Court\nsentencing judge accepted a joint submission of two years less one day,\nfollowed by three years probation. There were also a number of ancillary orders\nmade.[16]The offender went to\njail that day. On May 21, 2014 he was paroled.[17]After extensive efforts\nthe police were finally able to decipher the code and enter the offender’s\nDataLocker hard drives. More child pornography was found. The accused was\narrested on September 17, 2014 and charged with seven child pornography related\noffences. He has entered guilty pleas to four of the seven counts. A summary of\nthe circumstances relating to each of those individual counts is as follows.(a)Count 1[18]Count 1 reads:(1)On or about the 23rd day of November, A.D. 2011\nat or near Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, did:Have in his possession child pornography to wit:\nimages of children under 18 years of age engaged in explicit sexual activity\nand/or the focus of the image was the genital or anal region of the child under\n18 years of age, contrary to section 163.1(4) of the Criminal Code.[19]Using further advanced\ntechnology, the police re-searched the offender’s red Dell laptop computer that\nhad been seized during the initial investigation on November 23, 2011, and\nfound 16 video or picture images that constituted child pornography. The police\nalso found a video of a young boy urinating in a toilet at the offender’s\nresidence. This boy was subsequently identified. The Crown submits that the\noffender created the recording, although they have chosen not to lay a charge\nof making child pornography relating to this event; rather the Crown is content\nto have this circumstance considered as part of the child pornography material\npossessed by the offender and covered by Count 1. Additionally, the Crown\nsubmits that the images created by the offender, which are the subject of Count\n2 and Count 3 were also possessed by him. This is the essence of Count 1.(b)Count 2[20]Count 2 reads:(2)Between the 10th day of November,\nA.D. 2009 and the 21st day of September, A.D. 2010, at or near Saskatoon,\nSaskatchewan, did:Make\nchild pornography to wit: making images of a known person under 18 years of age\nengaged in explicit sexual activity and/or the focus of the image was the\ngenital or anal region of that person, contrary to section 163.1(2) of the Criminal\nCode.[21]The offender\nvolunteered with the Big Brothers Big Sisters [BBBS] organization. In this\ncapacity he was entrusted with the care of two boys, D.H. and J.H., who were\nbrothers. The offender took them to a swimming pool. While in the dressing\nroom, the offender surreptitiously recorded them changing in and out of their\nbathing suits on several occasions. The boys were together and the videos were\nmade of them at the same times and same places. Those files were located on a\nfolder named “SPI” that was on the encrypted DataLocker hard drives. These\nvideos were made and possessed by the offender, but were never shared with\nanyone.(c)Count 3[22]Count 3 reads:(3)Between the 10th day\nof May, A.D. 2011 and the 6th day of December, A.D. 2011, at or near\nSaskatoon, Saskatchewan, did:Make child pornography to wit: making images of a\nknown person under 18 years of age engaged in explicit sexual activity and/or\nthe focus of the image was the genital or anal region of that person, contrary\nto section 163.1(2) of the Criminal Code.[23]This count is\nessentially the same as Count 2, except the victim is a different young boy\nnamed S.D. These videos were made at a different time than those made in Count\n2. As in the case of the boys who are the subject of Count 2, the offender had\nvolunteered with the BBBS organization. While with S.D., who had been entrusted\nto his care, the offender surreptitiously video recorded him changing in and\nout of his bathing suit in a pool dressing room. These videos, also, were not disseminated\nor shared with anyone else.(d)Count 6[24]Count 6 reads:(6)Between the 8th day of March,\nA.D. 2010 and the 20th day of November, A.D. 2011, at or near\nSaskatoon, Saskatchewan, did:Have\nin his possession child pornography to wit: images or videos of children under\neighteen years of age engaged in explicit sexual activity and/or the focus of\nthe images or videos was the genital or anal region of the child, contrary to\nsection 163.1(4) of the Criminal Code.[25]Once the police cracked\nthe code and entered the offender’s DataLocker hard drives they found what can\nbe described as a treasure trove of child pornographic videos and images.[26]According to the\npolice, whose evidence is not disputed, there were 12,775 “unique” child\npornographic images or videos. The Crown is prepared to concede that some of\nthe images on the DataLocker hard drives could have been the same as the\napproximately 3,000 videos or images that were the subject of the first\nsentencing. Giving the offender the benefit of that doubt, it still means that\nthere were approximately 9,775 new videos and/or images for which he has not\nbeen sentenced.IV.SUMMARY OF AGGRAVATING AND MITIGATING\nCIRCUMSTANCES[27]Section 718.2 directs\nthe court to consider the aggravating and mitigating circumstances when\ndetermining the appropriate sentence for an offender. What follows is not an\nexhaustive list, but rather a brief mention, of the most significant aggravating\nand mitigating factors at play in this case.(a) Aggravating factors[28]The most prevalent\naggravating circumstances that are present include:(i)The sheer quantity and the\nvile nature of the materialA.Counts 1 and 6[29]The Crown played for\nthe court a sample of the images and videos that comprise Counts 1 and 6. Words\ncannot begin to express the vile and depraved nature of these sickening and\ndisgusting recordings. The images and recordings depicted, among other things,\nvery young children – some just toddlers – engaged in oral, vaginal and anal\nsex with adults. I echo the words of Dovell J. in R v Pattison, 2012\nSKQB 330 (CanLII), at para 72, 403 Sask R 145 [Pattison], who after being shown a\nsampling of the child pornography in that case, said:… [the images and videos] are vile in nature to the\npoint of being “life changing” in their effect upon one’s psyche. At points\nwhen being shown these images, the Court was numbed by their depravity. … .[30]The offender is being\nsentenced for possessing approximately 9,775 child pornographic files,\nincluding still photos and videos. This represents 9,775 child victims. The\nmaterial was repugnant, disturbing and reprehensible.B.Counts 2 and 3[31]The offender made 11\nvideos of young boys changing in the dressing room. A sample of these videos\nwas played for the court. The focus of the recordings is obviously on the boys’\ngenitals. The offender is not depicted doing anything with the boys – other than\nsecretly recording them as they changed. As mentioned, these videos were not\nposted on the internet or shared with anyone.(ii)The victims were children[32]The fact that the\nvictims were children is specifically designated by the Criminal Code as\nan aggravating circumstance by ss. 718.01 and ss. 718.2(a)(ii.1),(iii)The offender was in a position of trust with respect to the victims in Counts\n2 and 3[33]The fact that the\noffender occupied a position of trust is specifically designated by the Criminal\nCode as an aggravating circumstance by virtue of s. 718.2(a)(iiii).(iv)Harm to the victims[34]There is real harm to\nthe thousands of unnamed unknown child victims whose images/videos were used\nfor sexual gratification by people, like the offender, who view this material.\nFurther, as set forth by the victim impact statements of the mothers of the\nboys, whose dignity was violated by the surreptitious video recording, the psychological\nhurt is deep and real. The court has listened to these victims and has taken\ntheir comments into account in arriving at the offender’s sentence.(v)Alleged failure to assist in\nthe investigation: Not an aggravating circumstance[35]The Crown argued\nforcefully at the sentencing hearing that the court should consider, as\naggravating, the fact that the offender did not come totally clean and assist\nthe police in their DataLocker investigation. The suggestion being that this\nshowed a lack of remorse. However, the failure to assist in the investigation,\nat best, would be the neutralization of what could have been a mitigating\nfactor. It is not an aggravating factor. As stated by the Court of Appeal in R\nv Leroux, 2015 SKCA 48 (CanLII), at para 62, 460 Sask R 1 [Leroux]:… an accused individual is always\nentitled to rely on the right to remain silent, the presumption of innocence\nand the right to make full answer and defence, etc. In other words, accused\nindividuals are entitled to maintain their innocence, plead not guilty and\nconduct a full trial on the charges without repercussion at sentencing for\ndoing so.[36]The “cost” however, is\nthe inability to advance the act of co‑operation as a mitigating factor.\nFurther, laying in the weeds can have negative repercussions in that as old\noffences emerge, an offender is required to face multiple sentencing\nsituations, as is the case here.(b)Mitigating factors[37]The most prevalent\nmitigating circumstances that are present include:(i)No\nprevious criminal record[38]But for the conviction\nfor the related convictions, the offender has no previous criminal record.(ii)Guilty plea[39]The offender plead\nguilty to the charges under consideration, thus accepting responsibility for\nhis actions.(iii)The offender’s age[40]At only 27 years of\nage, the offender is a young man. At the time of his arrest he was only 23\nyears old. Generally speaking, the young age of an offender is considered a\nmitigating factor because it presents the greatest opportunity for reform.(iv)The offender’s\nrehabilitation[41]The offender has taken\nsignificant steps to rehabilitate himself and, by all accounts, his\nrehabilitation is progressing very well.(v)Remorse[42]The offender, in my\nview, is genuinely remorseful. He has filed with the court apology letters to\nthe boys he video recorded. He has addressed this court in a positive and\nrespectful way and has demonstrated through both words and actions that he is\ntruly sorry for what he did.(vi)Low risk to re-offend[43]As a result of the\noffender’s treatment and genuine self-introspection, he has been assessed at a\nlow risk to re-offend.(vii)Positive conduct since\ninitial arrest[44]Since the offender’s\narrest almost 4-1/2 years ago, he has made positive strides toward reformation\nand there is no evidence that he has re-offended. He has done everything asked\nof him.V.POSITION OF THE CROWN AND THE\nDEFENCE(a)The Crown’s Position[45]The Crown requests that\nthe court impose a global sentence of five years incarceration which, after\nappropriate credit for time spent on remand, would result in an additional\nsentence of 31 months in jail.[46]The Crown seeks 18\nmonths on Count 2 (making of child pornography), the minimum sentence for which\nis 12 months incarceration. The Crown justifies its request for a sentence in\nexcess of the mandatory minimum on the basis that the offender was in a\nposition of trust at the time that the offence was committed.[47]The Crown seeks an\nadditional 18 month sentence on Count 3 (making of child pornography of the\nother child victim), to be served consecutively. Given that the creation of\nthese video recordings involves a different victim on different occasions a\nsimilar, consecutive sentence of 18 months should be imposed.[48]The Crown seeks a two year\nconsecutive sentence for Count 6. The Crown submits that, generally speaking, a\nfour to five year sentence would be appropriate given the magnitude of the collection.\nAlthough the child pornography files, the subject of Count 6, are distinct from\nthose files for which the offender has already been sentenced, the Crown\nacknowledges that the previous circumstances need to be factored in. The Crown\njustifies the lower two year request on the basis that this somewhat lower\nsentence would factor in the previous convictions.[49]The Crown seeks a 12 month\nconcurrent sentence for Count 1. The Crown acknowledges that given the\noverlapping, albeit distinct, nature of the offences committed during the same time\nframe as the current offences and given the offences for which the offender has\nalready been sentenced, a concurrent sentence is justified.[50]The Crown, fairly,\nconcedes that the offender should be credited with a 1.5 credit for time spent\nin pre-trial custody. See R v Summers, 2014 SCC 26 (CanLII), [2014] 1 SCR 575; R\nv Carvery, 2014 SCC 27 (CanLII), [2014] 1 SCR 605; and R v Calliou, 2014 ABCA\n158 (CanLII), 575 AR 86. The offender was arrested on September 17, 2014, which\nmeans that up to, and including today, he has spent 577 days on remand. Crediting\nthe offender 1.5 days for every day in pre-trial detention results in a credit\nof 865.5 days, or, 29 months (865.530 = 28.85 29 months). This would result in a further\n31 more months in custody.[51]In addition, the Crown\nseeks a DNA order (s. 487.051), an order under the Sex Offender Information\nRegistration Act, SC 2004, c 10 [SOIRA] (s. 490.013(2.1)), a\nlifetime prohibition order restricting the offender’s presence in parks, pools,\netc. (s. 161), and a forfeiture order respecting the seized items (s. 490.1).(b)The Defence’s Position[52]The defence argues that\nthe offender should be sentenced to time served, and released today. The defence\npoints out that there have been no new criminal acts committed by the offender\nsince his initial arrest on November 23, 2011. All of the charges, so argues\nthe defence, arose out of the same set of circumstances. An additional 24 months\nin custody would be appropriate to punish the offender for the additional\nimages recovered by the police. Accordingly an additional 24 months should be\nimposed for Count 6.[53]The defence concedes\nthat the minimum mandatory sentence of one year should be imposed for Counts 2\nand 3, but argues that the sentences should be made concurrent to each other\nand Count 6. The defence agrees with the Crown’s position of 12 months\nconcurrent on Count 1. The total aggregate sentence would be 24 months. When\ncredit is then given for the 29 months spent in pre-trial custody, the result is\nthat the accused should be released today.[54]The defence does not take\nissue with the Crown’s request for the imposition of the ancillary orders – other\nthan the Crown’s request for a lifetime order pursuant to s. 161. Defence\ncounsel submits that to prohibit the offender from ever going to a park or\nplayground or pool for the rest of his life – even with his own children,\nshould he have them – is unduly harsh. The defence contends that there is no\nneed to impose a lifetime s. 161 order on a person in his 20s for what is, in\nessence, his first offence.VI.PERSONAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE\nOFFENDER[55]The offender is 27\nyears of age, soon to be 28 on April 28. He was just 23 years old when he was\narrested. He is not married. He has no children. By all accounts, he comes from\na caring, loving family. He has the support of his father, his two younger\nbrothers, and the rest of his family. Tragically, his mother passed away\nsuddenly in January 2012, shortly after his initial arrest. He graduated from\nhigh school with a 95 percent average. Prior to his initial arrest he had been\nattending university and maintained a 90 percent plus average. He was aspiring\nto be a medical doctor – a goal that was potentially within his reach.[56]He has sought treatment\nand has been under the care of a clinical psychologist, Dr. Brian Chartier,\nsince December 2011. He has been seen by the psychologist 44 times since then.\nThe defence filed with the court a report from the psychologist that is very\npositive. The psychologist notes the presence of actual remorse. Dr. Chartier\nstates in his report:… In working with him, I now see the presence of\nremorse not for being caught but for the effect of his behaviour on others. …He has taken sex offender treatment. A\nreport was filed. It suggests that the offender was an active, eager and\nengaged participant.[57]The offender completed\nthe “Thinking For A Change Program”. It is a voluntary program that was comprised\nof 22 lessons. Each lesson was 2.5 hours. He was rated “Low” on the Primary\nRisk Assessment. The program facilitator had this to say about the offender:Summary and Recommendations:Justin took the program very seriously. He\nparticipated at an exceptionally high level through out the course. He quickly\nunderstood the concepts and was able to put the information into his own words.\nHe often was able to bring the information to a much higher level and see\nimplications of the course content to other areas of life. He was very mature\nand considered the needs of others in the group as well.He showed excellent improvement between the pre-test\nand the post-test scores. This is consistent with the information written in\nhis homework assignments and the answers given in classroom discussions.He had an exceptionally detailed relapse prevention\nplan. He showed great understanding of his risky thoughts and feelings. He\ncould readily see what was causing the problem. He also could see what he\nneeded to do to cope with the issues and avoid them in the first place.Overall, he successfully completed the Thinking for a\nChange program.[58]This prompted that facilitator\nto write in one of his reports:… He has one of the most defined and comprehensive\nrelapse prevention plans seen. This doesn’t guarantee [that there will be no] relapse\nbut understanding and planning for it definitively reduces the likelyhood [sic]\nof it occuring [sic] again.[59]While taking a\ntreatment program the offender, in the context of responding to a question of\nlikelihood to reoffend, wrote these insightful words:I am 99% certain that this will never happen again,\nleaving that remaining 1% chance as my strongest motivation to continue taking\nevery possible step to ensure that it really won’t ever happen again. The\nlargest promising factor in my vow to never reoffend is also unfortunately the\nfactor that I am most ashamed of: that my actions were and are completely under\nmy control. It is still devistating [sic] for me to admit that nothing\nmade me seek out that material that I somehow allowed myself to ignore my moral\ncode in a selfish and blind quest for wholeness. Yet it is that very point that\nhas been empowering in showing me that with a critical set of cognitive skills,\nI am able to consciously and proactively avoid that same criminal activity. The\nskills I examined and developed through T4C such as understanding my own\nfeelings, the process of cognitive self-change and understanding the feelings\nof others – place upon me not only the ability but the responsibility of\nactively countering any opportunity to commit a future offence. By working\nthrough the thoughts, feelings, situations and warning signs associated with an\nincreased chance of reoffending and creating action plans to constructively\ndeal with them … I feel I am as confident as possible without becoming\ncomplacent to [sic] vigilance.In addition to T4C, a number of programs have assisted\nin developing skills to deal with potential risky thoughts, feelings and\nsituations as well as exploring a deeper awareness into the causes, effects,\nrepercussions and thought processes related to my offence. These programs\ninclude: the continual help of my psychologist over the last year, the Courage\n2 Change program, the Grief and Loss program, the Key to Your Expected End\nprogram, the Return to Spirit program and the Goal Setting program.Along with how these programs have empowered me, they\nhave also revealed and emphasized the vast support network that surrounds me\nand how I am connected to them. They are there so I do not need to deal with my\nissues alone. They have also shown me how intricately tied their lives are to\nmine and how my actions have far reaching effects on others, stressing how devistating\n[sic] and unreconcilable any reoffence would be not just to myself but\nto all those around me. I have been given a second chance to be a productive\nmember of society, to seek and recieve [sic] forgiveness for my\ninexcusable actions, and to live my life that demonstrates to myself and to\nothers that I have the power to change. They are all there for me, supporting\nme, helping me to ensure that this first offence is my last offence.I liken my experience through this all to that of the\nprocess of refinement: through struggles and difficulties I have not only\nidentified my risks, weaknesses, and errors, but I have also emmerged [sic]\nwith a clear understanding of who I am and the direction I must take. I have\nemmerged [sic] stronger. I have emmerged [sic] with a future, and\nso I towards that remaining 1% chance I have of reoffending as the guide in\ndirecting my thoughts, feelings and actions in a way that consciously and\nactively, personally and communally brings me to live a life consistent with my\nvalues. A life I am proud of.[60]The offender did a terrible\nthing. But there is hope for him.VII.ANALYSIS(a)Counts 2 and 3: Making child pornography[61]I agree with the Crown’s\nsubmissions respecting Counts 2 and 3 – the two counts of making child\npornography. The seriousness with which Parliament views this offence is\ndemonstrated by the maximum and minimum penalties set forth in the Criminal\nCode. At the time the offence was committed the offence could be prosecuted\nby either indictable or summary procedure. For an indictable offence the\nmaximum term of imprisonment was 10 years; the mandatory minimum was one year.\nToday, the offence is no longer punishable by summary conviction procedure. The\nminimum punishment remains at one year, however the maximum has been increased\nto 14 years.[62]The offender, by law,\nmust be sentenced in accordance with the provisions that existed at the time the\noffence was committed – which was, a mandatory minimum of one year up to a\nmaximum of 10 years imprisonment.[63]The circumstances of\nthe offence itself, albeit despicable and creepy, are on the lower end of the\nscale. “Making child pornography” covers a wide range of territory, from\nrecording reprehensible non-consensual sexual acts to pure voyeurism. This was\na surreptitious recording of young boys changing, which is wrongful and\nunlawful, but amounts to a form of voyeurism. Although towards the lower end of\nthe scale, it is, nonetheless, definitely a form of abuse.[64]What makes it more serious\nis the fact that the recordings happened on several occasions, the victims were\nchildren and the offender was in a position of trust. It is probably enough to\nstate that applying common sense compels a conclusion that these factors are\naggravating and require the level of punishment to be moved off of the\nmandatory minimum. This common sense conclusion is bolstered by a number of\nsentencing principles that the court must consider and balance, as directed by\ns. 718 of the Criminal Code. Of particular relevance are:718.01 When a court imposes a sentence for an offence\nthat involved the abuse of a person under the age of eighteen years, it shall\ngive primary consideration to the objectives of denunciation and deterrence of\nsuch conduct.718.2…(a) a sentence should be increased or\nreduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances\nrelating to the offence or the offender, and, without limiting the generality\nof the foregoing,…(ii.1) evidence that the offender, in\ncommitting the offence, abused a person under the age of eighteen years;(iii) evidence that the offender, in\ncommitting the offence, abused a position of trust or authority in relation to\nthe victim.…shall be deemed to be aggravating\ncircumstances.[65]Although the act itself\nis not as serious as some offences of this nature, the existence of the above\nreferred to aggravating factors requires a sentence more profound than the\nmandatory one year minimum.[66]The Crown’s suggestion\nof 18 months for each count strikes the right balance and amounts to a fit and\nproper sentence in the circumstances.[67]Generally speaking, and\nsubject to the principle of totality, offences that occur on separate occasions\nagainst separate victims will attract a consecutive sentence. See Leroux,\nat para 94. To make the sentences concurrent in this case would, in effect,\nmean that no sentence at all was imposed for one of the offences. Therefore\nCounts 2 and 3 should attract a sentence of 18 months on each count, to be\nserved consecutively.(b)Count 6[68]The offender must now\nalso be sentenced for the possession of approximately 9,775 child pornographic\nimages and videos. This, as I pointed out earlier, is in addition to the\napproximately 3,000 other images and videos for which he has already been\nsentenced.[69]The possession of 9,775\n“unique” image or video files represents the victimization of 9,775 children.\nGranted, in the context of this count, the offender did nothing other than view\nthe material. The uninformed may say, “What is the harm of simply viewing some pictures\nor some videos?” As the offender now recognizes the very existence of child\npornography is inherently harmful to children and society. The Supreme Court of\nCanada in R v Sharpe, 2001 SCC 2 (CanLII), at paras 28 and 158, [2001] 1 SCR 45, put\nit this way:28 … no one denies that\nchild pornography involves the exploitation of children. The links between\npossession of child pornography and harm to children are arguably more\nattenuated than are the links between the manufacture and distribution of child\npornography and harm to children. However, possession of child pornography\ncontributes to the market for child pornography, a market which in turn drives\nproduction involving the exploitation of children. Possession of child\npornography may facilitate the seduction and grooming of victims and may break\ndown inhibitions or incite potential offences.…158The very existence of child pornography, as it is\ndefined by s. 163.1(1) of the Criminal Code, is inherently harmful to children\nand to society. This harm exists independently of dissemination or any risk of\ndissemination and flows directly from the existence of the pornographic\nrepresentations, which on their own violate the dignity and equality rights of\nchildren. The harm of child pornography is inherent because degrading,\ndehumanizing, and objectifying depictions of children, by their very existence,\nundermine the Charter rights of children and other members of society. Child\npornography eroticises the inferior social, economic, and sexual status of\nchildren. It preys on preexisting inequalities.[70]Today, possession of\nchild pornography, if prosecuted by indictment, attracts a minimum term of\nimprisonment of one year. The maximum term of imprisonment is 10 years. At the\ntime of the commission of the offence, convictions for indictable offences\nrequired a minimum of 45 days in jail; the maximum was five years in jail. As\nstated earlier, the law is clear that the offender must be sentenced according\nto the law that existed at the time the offences were committed. However, the\nincrease in the minimum and maximum penalties signals the seriousness with\nwhich Parliament views this type of offence.[71]The act of amassing\nthis quantity of child pornography requires a stiff sentence to send the\nmessage that the commission of this type of offence will result in a lengthy\nperiod of incarceration. Although, as has already been said, there is no\nspecific prison term that is automatically associated with a particular\nquantity of child pornography; penitentiary terms are now the norm. Counsel for\nboth the Crown and defence filed case authorities with this court. All of those\ndecisions were reviewed, and in some respects studied. I do not intend to list\nthem here. They are on the court file. Decisions such as Pattison and R\nv Stupnikoff, 2013 SKPC 57 (CanLII), 416 Sask R 307, and the decisions referred to therein,\nwere instructive. Although the precise term of incarceration tends to vary\nthere appears to be a general upward trend. I am also mindful of s. 718.2(b)\nthat directs that a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar\noffenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.[72]Complicating the sentencing\nof this offender for this charge is the fact that he has already been sentenced\nfor possessing similar (albeit far less in quantity) images/videos on other\ndevices that were seized on November 23, 2011. How does that circumstance factor\ninto this sentencing? Strictly speaking, in theory, the Crown could lay\na separate charge for each piece of child pornography allegedly possessed by an\noffender. Typically the Crown does not do that. However, the fact that the\nCrown generally does not do so, does not mean that the offender should get some\ntype of “bulk discount”. See R v Andrukonis, 2012 ABCA 148 (CanLII), 524 AR 306.\nHowever, notwithstanding this general concept, the previous circumstances must\nbe factored in. But how?[73]In Leroux, the Saskatchewan\nCourt of Appeal addressed a situation that raised similar considerations. In\n1998 Mr. Leroux was convicted of sexually assaulting 14 boys between 1968 and\n1979. He was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment.[74]After serving that\nsentence, several other complainants stepped forward alleging similar sexual\nabuse during a similar period of time. At para. 60 Caldwell J.A. speaking\nfor the court determined that the simple fact of the existence of the previous\nsentence is not mitigating per se but is “… something that must be\nworked into the mix of considerations”. In that case, however, he noted that, “…\ngiven what is already in the mix in this case, it has no appreciable effect on\nsentence here”.[75]A similar conclusion\nwas arrived at by the Manitoba Court of Appeal in R v James, 2013 MBCA\n14 (CanLII), 288 Man R (2d) 269 [James]. In 1997 the offender was convicted of\nsexually abusing two boys while he was their hockey coach. He received a\nsentence of 3-1/2 years in prison. Then, 14 years later, in 2011, two other\nboys, who had also been coached by the offender came forward and alleged sexual\nabuse in a similar fashion in roughly the same time frame. The Manitoba Court\nof Appeal found that it was an error for the sentencing judge to have approached\nthe second sentencing by hypothesizing what the total sentence would have been\nin 1997 had the two new allegations been included in the sentencing at that\ntime. The appeal court found that the starting point was not what would have\nhappened in 1997, but rather the focus should have been on the offences before\nthe court at that time. At para. 57 the court said:57 What happened in 1997 was clearly relevant\ninformation for consideration by the judge in determining what an appropriate\nsentence would be in respect of the offences against [the two new\ncomplainants], but it was an error to give that factor the pre-eminent focus\nwhich she did.[76]I extract from these\ntwo decisions the principle that the focus must be on the present offences and\nthat the previous disposition ought to be considered, albeit, not unduly so.[77]Applying this concept\nand taking into account all the factors that I am required to consider as\noutlined in s. 718 of the Criminal Code leads me to the conclusion that\nthe Crown’s position of two years, consecutive is appropriate. This factors in\nthe circumstance that the offender has been subject to some legal process since\nthe day of his original arrest on November 23, 2011, a period of four years,\nfour months, 24 days. A good portion of that time has been in custody serving\nhis sentence and on remand awaiting disposition of these charges.[78]He has not reoffended,\nhas successfully completed programs aimed at his rehabilitation and has expressed\nwhat I believe to be genuine remorse.[79]Accordingly, I believe\nthat the appropriate sentence, before applying the principle of totality, for\nthis offence is two years, consecutive.(c)Count 1[80]Both the Crown and\ndefence agree that 12 months concurrent is the appropriate disposition for Count\n1. Many of the elements of this count are also present in the other counts. For\ninstance, this count includes possession of the videos that the offender is\nalready being sentenced for under Counts 2 and 3 – making child pornography.\nAlthough the additional 16 video/images are different than those included in Count\n6 and were stored in a different place, there is a sufficient nexus between\nCount 1 and Count 6 to justify a concurrent sentence.[81]Accordingly, I believe\nthat the appropriate sentence for Count 1 is 12 months incarceration,\nconcurrent.VIII.APPLICATION OF THE TOTALITY PRINCIPLE[82]The principle of\ntotality may be applied where consecutive sentences are imposed. In James,\nthe Manitoba Court of Appeal, at para. 61, said:61 … the principle of totality is considered\nwhere consecutive sentences are imposed and where, before the sentence is finally\ndetermined, a “last look” is taken to determine that the cumulative or\naggregate sentence which would otherwise be imposed does not exceed the overall\nculpability of the offender.[83]The principle of\ntotality is conceptually related to the “Fundamental principle” of sentencing\nset forth in s. 718.1 of the Criminal Code, and at least one of the “Other\nsentencing principles” listed in s. 718.2(c). These sections read as follows:Fundamental principle718.1A\nsentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of\nresponsibility of the offender.Other sentencing principles718.2 …(c) where consecutive sentences are imposed,\nthe combined sentence should not be unduly long or harsh.[84]When discussing this\nconcept the Manitoba Court of Appeal offered the following helpful comments, at\nparas. 62 and 63:62In\nR. v. M. (C.A.), Lamer C.J.C. wrote with approval of the comments of D.\nA. Thomas in Principles of Sentencing, 2d ed. (London: Heinemann\nEducational Books Ltd., 1979) at 56, and of the comments of Clayton C. Ruby in Sentencing,\n4th ed. (Markham: Butterworths Canada Ltd., 1994) at 44-45. Lamer C.J.C. wrote\n(at para. 42):In the context of consecutive sentences,\nthis general principle of proportionality expresses itself through the more\nparticular form of the “totality principle”. The totality principle, in short,\nrequires a sentencing judge who orders an offender to serve consecutive\nsentences for multiple offences to ensure that the cumulative sentence rendered\ndoes not exceed the overall culpability of the offender. As D. A. Thomas\ndescribes the principle in Principles of Sentencing (2nd ed.\n1979), at p. 56:The effect of the totality principle is to require a\nsentencer who has passed a series of sentences, each properly calculated in\nrelation to the offence for which it is imposed and each properly made\nconsecutive in accordance with the principles governing consecutive sentences,\nto review the aggregate sentence and consider whether the aggregate sentence is\n“just and appropriate”.Clayton Ruby articulates the principle\nin the following terms in his treatise, Sentencing, supra, at pp.\n44-45:The purpose is to ensure that a series of sentences, each\nproperly imposed in relation to the offence to which it relates, is in\naggregate “just and appropriate”. A cumulative sentence may offend the totality\nprinciple if the aggregate sentence is substantially above the normal level of\na sentence for the most serious of the individual offences involved, or if its\neffect is to impose on the offender “a crushing sentence” not in keeping with\nhis record and prospects.63The application\nof the totality principle necessitates a consideration by a sentencing judge of\nthe gravity of the offences, the offender’s degree of guilt or moral\nblameworthiness with respect to the crimes committed, and the harm done to the\nvictim or victims.[85]Consideration\nrespecting pre-sentence credit ought only be applied after addressing totality.\nSee R v Constant, 2013 MBCA 97 (CanLII), 299 Man R (2d) 196. Accordingly, it is\nnecessary to first apply the totality principle, and then make the pre-sentence\ncredit adjustment.[86]Taking a “last look” in\nthe context of the application of the totality principle requires an\nexamination of a number of factors including the gravity of the offences, the\noffender’s degree of guilt, the harm done to the victims, and the offender’s\npersonal circumstances. Here, the gravity and degree of guilt is high and the\nharm to the victims is significant. On the other hand, the offender, who has\nhad the weight of his wrongful conduct on his shoulders for almost 4-1/2 years,\nhas worked hard towards rehabilitation. He has no previous criminal record\nother than for the earlier related convictions and has a bright future. To impose\na further five year sentence would amount to an overly harsh and crushing\nsentence not in keeping with his prospects and the principle of\nproportionality.[87]In my view the\napplication of the totality principle should operate to reduce the aggregate\nsentence of 60 months (five years) to 53 months, less one day. Then, applying\nthe remand credit adjustment, the 53 months, less one day, is reduced further\nby 29 months to 24 months, less one day. A “totality” principle reduction from\nthe aggregate sentence of seven months, one day, results in a go-forward\nsentence of two years, less one day. This term of incarceration is fair and\ntakes into account two other important considerations.[88]Firstly, a sentence of\ntwo years less one day means that the offender will serve the rest of his\nsentence in a provincial jail rather than a federal penitentiary. Keeping the\noffender out of the federal penitentiary system will benefit both the offender\nand society in general by reducing the odds that his continued rehabilitation\nwill be hampered in the harsh federal setting. Secondly, reducing the aggregate\nsentence in this way permits the court to impose probation, additional to the\nincarceration – a sanction not available for sentences of incarceration over\ntwo years by operation of s. 731(1)(b). A probation order of three years would\nbe, in my view, most appropriate. It permits a further level of control to best\nensure that the possibility of recidivism is reduced. Especially considering\nthe offender’s age and positive prospects, reducing the aggregate sentence by a\nfurther seven months, one day, and replacing it with three years probation\nresults in a sentence that must closely balance all the considerations and principles\nthat I am required to take into account in crafting the best possible sentence\nin all of the circumstances.[89]Even with this\nadjustment, the net effect is that the offender will have spent the vast\nmajority of his 20s in jail.IX.SENTENCE[90]I find that the\nappropriate sentence for this offender to be:Count 2:18 monthsCount 3:18 months, consecutiveCount 6:17 months, less one day,\nconsecutiveCount 1:12 months, concurrent.[91]The aggregate period of\nincarceration, is therefore, 53 months, less one day, incarceration.[92]This total is reduced\nby 29 months, which represents the time the offender spent in pre-sentence\ncustody on these charges. This results in an actual sentence, on a go-forward\nbasis, from today, of two years less one day. Of course, and just to be clear,\nthis is over and above the two years less one day sentence he has already\nserved for related offences.[93]In addition, the offender\nwill be placed on probation for three years. The terms of the probation order\nshall be the same as those ordered by the Honourable Judge Agnew on January 21,\n2013, attached as Appendix “A” herein. I know counsel spent some time in\ndrafting these provisions. I have reviewed them and find them to be appropriate\nhere.X.ANCILLARY ORDERS[94]I make the following\nancillary orders:(a)The\noffences under consideration are primary designated offences within the meaning\nof the Criminal Code. Therefore there shall be a DNA order pursuant to\ns. 487.051(1) of the Criminal Code in Form 5.03, authorizing the\ntaking of samples from the offender for the purpose of DNA analysis.(b)The\noffences under consideration are designated offences within the meaning of s.\n490 of the Criminal Code. Therefore, there will also be an order in Form\n52, requiring the offender to comply with the SOIRA, pursuant to\ns. 490.013. Since the offender has plead guilty to more than one\ndesignated offence the order herein made applies for life.(c)The\nCrown also seeks a lifetime prohibition order pursuant to s. 161 of the Criminal\nCode. That section requires that when sentencing offenders for these types\nof offences that the court consider whether the offender should be prohibited\nfrom certain activities, such as attending a public swimming area where young\npeople are reasonably expected to be. This discretionary prohibition may be for\nlife, or a lesser period if the court considers it desirable. A lifetime\nprohibition order, as requested by the Crown is too harsh and is a\ndisproportionate response to the circumstances here. A five year prohibition\norder strikes the correct balance. Accordingly, using the provisions of s. 161\nin effect at the time the offences were committed, I hereby prohibit the offender\nfrom:i)attending\na public park or public swimming area where persons under the age of 16 years\nare present or can reasonably be expected to be present, or a daycare centre,\nschool ground, playground or community centre, unless while\nin the presence of a sober responsible adult who is aware of his conviction;ii)seeking,\nobtaining or continuing any employment, whether or not the employment is\nremunerated, or becoming or being a volunteer in a capacity, that involves\nbeing in a position of trust or authority towards persons under the age of 16\nyears; oriii)using a\ncomputer system within the meaning of ss. 342.1(2) for the purpose of\ncommunicating with a person under the age of 16 years;for a period of\nfive years from his release from imprisonment.(d)There\nshall also be a forfeiture order pursuant to s. 490.1 of the Criminal Code,\nin the form of the draft order filed and attached as Appendix “B” herein, by\nthe Crown forfeiting the following items to the Crown:1.PE9 Dell Laptop XPS L5C2X with\nhard drive, serial number H86HSQ1, with hard drive serial number WXB1A6147554;2.PE16 DataLocker Enterprise\nEncrypted hard drive, serial number DL0207K09002925; and3.PE18\nDataLocker external drive serial number 3000850.(e)These\noffences occurred prior to October 24, 2013, the day on which the ability of a\njudge to waive imposition of victim’s surcharges was restricted. In view of the\nfact that the offender will continue to be incarcerated, the victim surcharge\notherwise payable pursuant to s. 737(5) is waived.(f)Finally,\nthere will be an order releasing all exhibits filed by the Crown in this\nproceeding to the Saskatoon Police Service for their proper disposal, upon\nexpiry of all appeal periods. In the meantime all documents already ordered\nsealed by the court, shall remain sealed.[95]Does the Crown wish to\nstay the remaining charges?C.J.Q.B.M.D. POPESCUL"}

Nordheimer of the\nSuperior Court of Justice dated January 10, 2002.E N D O R S E M E N T[1]The appellant was convicted of dangerous driving\ncausing death and dangerous driving causing bodily harm.The charges arose out\nof a car accident which occurred on a city street in Toronto.The appellant\nwas driving at an excessive speed on a wet road and lost control of his\nvehicle.The appellant appeals his conviction and the sentence of two years\nless a day imposed by the trial judge.[2]The appellant advances two grounds of appeal on\nthe conviction appeal.He contends that the trial judge erred in holding that\nthe appellant’s right under s. 11(b) of the Charter had not been\ninfringed.The appellant also argues that the trial erred in his\ninterpretation of s. 577 of the Criminal Code and should have found that\nthe Attorney General had no power to consent to the preferring of the\nindictment.The appellant had been committed for trial but, that committal had\nbeen quashed by a judge of the Superior Court.The Attorney General then\npreferred an indictment under s. 577(a).[3]The trial judge addressed the two arguments\nadvanced on appeal in careful and detailed reasons.We agree with those\nreasons and do not propose to add anything to his analysis of the s. 11(b)\nclaim.For the reasons set out by the trial judge we reject that claim.[4]With respect to the interpretation of s. 577(a)\nof the Criminal Code as it read at the time of the trial, like the trial\njudge, we agree with the interpretation of that section found in R. v.\nCharlie (1998), 1998 CanLII 4145 (BC CA), 126 C.C.C. (3d) 513 (B.C. C.A.) and R. v. Ewen\n(2000), 2000 SKCA 36 (CanLII), 144 C.C.C. (3d) 277 (Sask. C.A.).In those cases, the courts held that\nwhere a committal for trial was quashed, it could not be said that a\npreliminary inquiry had been held for the purpose of s. 577(a) of the Criminal\nCode.The Attorney General or his Deputy were, therefore, authorized to\nconsent to the preferment of the indictment.[5]Section 577 of the Criminal Code limits\nthe power of the prosecutor to prefer an indictment set out in s. 574.We read\ns. 577 as providing that where there has been no judicial determination that\nthere is a prima facie case against an accused, an indictment can be\npreferred against the accused only where the Attorney General or the Deputy\nAttorney General personally consents to the preferment of the indictment.This\nlimitation is intended to give the accused added protection from unwarranted\nprosecution absent a judicial determination that a trial is justified.The\ninterpretation of s. 577 in R. v. Charlie, supra, is consistent with the\npurpose of s. 577.We agree with the trial judge that the Attorney General had\nthe authority to prefer this indictment under s. 577(a).[6]As to sentence, the trial judge erred the\nprinciple in holding that a conditional sentence would not be appropriate\nbecause he could not be assured that there was a sufficient structure that\nwould ensure obedience to the conditions.In fairness, the trial judge did not\nhave the benefit of this court’s decision in R. v. Nault (2002), 2002 CanLII 44945 (ON CA), 59 O.R.\n(3d) 388.We are not convinced that this error did not infect the trial\njudge’s findings respecting the need for deterrence and denunciation.It\ntherefore falls to this court to determine the appropriate sentence.[7]We are not persuaded that this is the proper\ncase for a conditional sentence given the serious conduct that led to the\noffence.In our view, given the appellant’s good character, minimal driving\nrecord, the fact that alcohol played no role in the accident and the relatively\nbrief nature of the bad driving, an appropriate sentence would be fifteen\nmonths imprisonment.[8]Accordingly, leave to appeal sentence is\ngranted, the appeal is allowed and the sentence is reduced to fifteen months\nimprisonment.The driving prohibition as imposed by the trial judge will\nstand.Given the time the appellant has been on bail pending appeal, we see no\nneed for probation and that part of the sentence will be set aside.“Doherty\nJ.A.”“John\nLaskin J.A.”“M.\nRosenberg J.A.”"}

He received a suspended\nsentence. He appealed his conviction and sentence to the Summary Conviction\nAppeal Court. Both appeals were dismissed. Mr. Sohal now seeks leave to appeal\nhis sentence.The Circumstances of the Offence and the\nOffender[2]The case arose from an incident that occurred on\na sidewalk in Brampton. Several motorists witnessed the applicant and the\ncomplainant (his girlfriend) in an altercation. The witnesses saw the applicant\ngrab the complainant’s arm and then strike her. Some of them pulled over to assist\nthe complainant.[3]The applicant was 22 years old at the time of\nsentencing. He had no prior criminal record. The applicant came to Canada from\nIndia in 2012 on a student visa. As a result of the Immigration and Refugee\nProtection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, his conviction makes him inadmissible based\non criminality. We are advised that the applicant will be deported on May 31,\n2017.[4]The sentencing judge was aware of the\napplicant’s immigration status. He was not persuaded that a discharge, which\nwould avoid the immigration problems accompanying a conviction, was a fit\nsentence for this incident of domestic violence. He entered a conviction and\nimposed a suspended sentence with nine months of probation. The Summary\nConviction Appeal Court Judge (“SCACJ”) agreed and dismissed the appeal against\nsentence.Analysis[5]The applicant argues that leave to appeal should\nbe granted because the SCACJ erred in: (1) relying on aggravating factors that\nwere not relied upon by the sentencing judge; and (2) misapplying the law as it\nrelates to the immigration consequences faced by the appellant. Applying the\nprinciples in R. v. R.R. (2008), 2008 ONCA 497 (CanLII), 90 O.R. (3d) 641, we would not\ngrant leave to appeal on either ground.(1)Aggravating Factors[6]In his reasons for dismissing the appeal, the\nSCACJ mentioned that the offence occurred in a public space and “ceased only\nafter the intervention of a few Good Samaritans.” The SCACJ also mentioned that\none of the witnesses said that, in the aftermath of the assault, the applicant\nattempted to justify his actions on the basis of his own cultural beliefs. He\nconsidered this to be an additional aggravating factor.[7]In referring to the Good Samaritans, the\nlanguage used by the SCACJ may have been imprecise. The trial judge did not\nfind that the assault stopped because others physically intervened or\nrestrained the applicant. However, it is clear that those who responded to what\nthey saw did so with the purpose of assisting the complainant and preventing\nfurther problems.[8]We agree that the SCACJ erred in relying upon an\nimputed cultural justification as an aggravating factor. The Crown did not rely\nupon it as an aggravating factor. The trial judge did not find that the\napplicant said these words. He did not consider this factor in sentencing the\napplicant.[9]In all of the circumstances, these references in\nthe reasons of the SCACJ were inconsequential. They had no tangible impact on\nhis review of the fitness of the sentence that was imposed. The trial judge’s\nreasons for sentence show that he applied the proper principles and the\nsentence imposed is owed deference. There was simply no basis for the SCACJ to\nintervene, nor is there any basis for this court to interfere. Consequently,\nleave is denied on this ground.(2)Immigration Consequences[10]The applicant argues that the SCACJ misapplied\nthe law relating to the impact of the applicant’s immigration status on the\nfitness of the sentence. We disagree.[11]Although the SCACJ failed to mention R. v.\nPham, 2013 SCC 15 (CanLII), [2013] 1 S.C.R. 739, which had been referred to during\nsubmissions, he considered a number of earlier cases that addressed this issue.\nOne of the authorities he relied on was R. v. Hamilton (2004), 2004 CanLII 11188 (ON CA), 71 O.R.\n(3d) 1 (C.A.). The reasoning in that case that was expressly adopted by the\nSupreme Court in Pham, at para. 19.[12]The failure to cite Pham was\ninconsequential. The SCACJ was satisfied that the sentencing judge gave\nappropriate consideration to the applicant’s immigration status. The applicant’s\nimmigration consequences were given serious consideration by both judges: see R.\nv. McKenzie, 2017 ONCA 128 (CanLII), 35 C.R. (7th) 216, para. 35. Neither judge was\npersuaded that it ought to have resulted in a more lenient disposition. We see\nno basis to intervene.Disposition[13]Leave to appeal is denied.“Paul Rouleau J.A.”“G.T.

His convictions on the charges of invitation to sexual touching and sexual assault were stayed. The accused met the 13-year-old complainant on an Internet chat room site and asked her how old she was. She told him that she was 14. He never again inquired about her age notwithstanding many comments she made which should have caused him to make additional inquiries about her age, including a statement that she was in grade 9. He repeatedly encouraged her to expose her naked breasts while he masturbated [page482] and exposed his genitals to her by webcam. He recorded and saved the images. When the complainant's mother discovered the accused's telephone number on her telephone bill and learned that the complainant had met the accused in a chat room, the mother called the accused, told him that the complainant was \"way underage\" and warned him that she would call the police if the contact persisted. The accused and the complainant continued to communicate over the Internet, and the accused arranged a clandestine meeting with the complainant at a hotel, where they engaged in various sexual acts, short of sexual intercourse. The accused was 24 years old at the time of the offences and had no criminal record. He was sentenced to a total of 23 months' incarceration (18 months for Internet luring, four months consecutive for sexual interference, one month consecutive for possession of child pornography and one month concurrent for indecent exposure), less two-for-one credit for 73 days of pre-sentence custody, followed by three years' probation. He appealed the convictions, arguing that the trial judge erred in rejecting the limited defence of mistake of age. He also appealed the sentence.Held, the appeal should be dismissed.The trial judge was fully alert to the fact that s. 172.1(4) of the Criminal Code required the accused to take \"reasonable steps\" to ascertain the complainant's age, while s. 150.1(4) required him to take \"all reasonable steps\". He correctly concluded that the accused's conduct in relation to ascertaining the complainant's age met neither of those standards. The trial judge also did not err in employing the equivalent of a due diligence test in assessing whether the accused took reasonable steps to ascertain the complainant's age. Section 172.1(4) requires an accused who claims mistake of age to have exercised a degree of care in ascertaining a complainant's age that a reasonable person in the circumstances would have exercised. To the extent that the trial judge's reasons could be read as requiring the accused to be highly sceptical of the complainant's assertion that she was 14 years old, there was no error in light of the many and varied red flags that the complainant may not have been 14 years old.The trial judge expressly took the duration and conditions of the accused's restrictive bail into account as a mitigating factor in imposing sentence. He was not required to engage in a precise mathematical calculation of the credit to be given for pre-sentence bail. The mitigating weight to be assigned to pre- sentence bail, if any, is a discretionary matter for the sentencing judge. Nor was the overall sentence unfit. The accused was persistent and relentless in his pursuit of sexual gratification from the complainant, and his conduct was consistent with grooming her. Grooming and possession of the child pornography in the context of Internet luring constitutes an aggravating feature when determining a fit sentence for the offence of luring.APPEAL by the accused from the conviction entered by R.J.

Krongold, for appellant.Deborah Calderwood, for respondent.The judgment of the court was delivered byCRONK J.A.:--I. Introduction[1] The appellant, Bogdan Dragos, was convicted of Internetluring, sexual interference, indecent exposure, sexual assault,invitation to sexual touching and possession of childpornography. His convictions on the charges of invitation tosexual touching and sexual assault were stayed on the basis ofR. v. Kienapple, 1974 CanLII 14 (SCC), [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729, [1974] S.C.J. No. 76. Hewas sentenced to a total of 23 months' imprisonment, lesscredit for 73 days of pre-sentence custody on a two-for-onebasis, plus three years' probation. He appeals from hisconvictions on all [page484] counts, except for the possessionof child pornography count to which he pleaded guilty, [SeeNote 1 below] and against sentence.[2] For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss both theconviction and the sentence appeals.II. Facts[3] The appellant met the complainant, \"E.B.\", on an Internetchat room site in late September or early October of 2006.During their first encounter on the chat room site, theappellant asked E.B. how old she was. She told him she was 14years old. In fact, she was only 13 years of age. This was theonly time that the appellant inquired of E.B. about her age.[4] In their initial online conversation, the appellant toldE.B. that he was 18 years old. He subsequently disclosed to herthat he was actually 24 years of age.[5] For the next three and one-half months, the appellant andE.B. communicated regularly over the Internet using the MSNchat service. At trial, approximately 1,000 pages of theirelectronic exchanges were admitted into evidence. Thesecommunications contain examples of explicit sexual language,and incidents in which the appellant repeatedly encouraged E.B.to expose her naked breasts to him while he masturbated andexposed his genitals to her by webcam. When E.B. did expose herbreasts, the appellant recorded the images by webcam and savedthem on his computer. There is no suggestion that hedisseminated these images to anyone else.[6] Throughout her contacts with the appellant, E.B. tried topresent herself as older than she actually was. Whenregistering on the chat room site, she indicated that she was14 years old, one year older than her true age. Although shewas in grade 8, she told the appellant that she was in grade 9.In her numerous MSN messages, she indicated that she hadpreviously dated \"older guys\", used sexually explicit \"streetlanguage\", implied that she was sexually experienced andsuggested -- notwithstanding her age -- that her weight wassimilar to that of an 11-year-old.[7] In December 2006, E.B.'s mother discovered long-distancetelephone calls to the appellant's telephone number on herphone bill. She called the number and spoke with the appellant.[page485] On discovering that the appellant had met E.B. ina chat room, E.B.'s mother told the appellant that E.B. was\"way underage\". She also told him that he was to have nofurther contact with E.B. and warned that if she saw his numberon her phone bill again, she would call the police. At the timeof this call, E.B.'s mother was unaware of the extent andsexual nature of the communications between E.B. and theappellant.[8] Contrary to E.B.'s mother's clear directions to theappellant, the appellant and E.B. continued to communicate overthe Internet and the appellant arranged to meet E.B. in January2007 at a hotel near E.B.'s home for a sexual encounter. E.B.attended the rendezvous, as agreed.[9] While alone together in a hotel room, the appellant andE.B. removed their clothes and participated in various sexualacts and sexual touching, but did not engage in sexualintercourse. The police arrived while the appellant and E.B.were still undressed and in the hotel room. They were taken tothe police station, the appellant was arrested and both gavevideotaped statements to the police. In his statement, theappellant said that he had stopped short of having intercoursewith E.B. because they both \"felt bad about it\" but that they\"did everything else\".III. Limited Defence of Mistake of Age[10] At trial, the defence theory was that the appellant atall times had an honest but mistaken belief that E.B. was 14years of age. Relying on E.B.'s statement to him that she was14 years old, the fact that they met on an Internet chat sitefor people 14 years old and older, E.B.'s claims that she wasin grade 9 and that she had dated older guys, and her use ofsexualized language in their communications, the appellantmaintained that he had taken sufficient steps in thecircumstances to ascertain E.B.'s actual age.[11] The central issue, therefore, was whether the Crown hadproved beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant failed totake sufficient steps in all the circumstances to ascertainE.B.'s age.[12] Under the relevant provisions of the Criminal Code,R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, the requisite legal standards for thedetermination of the sufficiency of steps taken to ascertain acomplainant's age arguably vary according to the offencealleged. Thus, at the relevant times, in respect of theoffences of sexual interference (s. 151), invitation to sexualtouching (s. 152) and indecent exposure (s. 173(2)), s.150.1(4) of the Code stated:150.1(4) It is not a defence to a charge under section 151or 152 . . . or 173(2) . . . that the accused believed thatthe complainant was fourteen [page486] years of age or moreat the time the offence is alleged to have been committedunless the accused took all reasonable steps to ascertain theage of the complainant. [See Note 2 below](Emphasis added)[13] In contrast, in respect of the offence of child Internetluring (s. 172.1(1)(c)), s. 172.1(4) of the Code provided inmaterial part as follows:172.1(4) It is not a defence to a charge [of Internetluring under s. 172.1(1)(c)] that the accused believed thatthe person . . . was at least . . . fourteen years of age. . . unless the accused took reasonable steps to ascertainthe age of the person.(Emphasis added)[14] Sections 150.1(4) and 172.1(4) of the Code thusestablish a limited defence of mistaken belief in the age of acomplainant. For the class of offences contemplated under thatprovision, s. 150.1(4) creates this limited defence where theaccused took \"all reasonable steps\" (emphasis added) toascertain the age of the complainant. In relation to theoffence of child Internet luring, s. 172.1(4) contemplates adefence of mistake of age on proof that the accused took\"reasonable steps\" to ascertain the age of the recipient ofthe electronic communication.[15] In this case, the appellant argued in his factum thatthe difference in the wording of ss. 150.1(4) and 172.1(4) ofthe Code indicates that different standards apply for theassessment of the sufficiency of steps taken to ascertain acomplainant's age, depending on the nature of the offencecharged. However, as I will explain, during oral argument theappellant resiled somewhat from this position, contendinggenerally that the trial judge erred by applying the \"allreasonable steps\" standard, based on a due diligence approach,to the Internet luring charge. In contrast, the Crownmaintained that the nature of the distinction between thestandards in these provisions, if any, is irrelevant in thiscase.IV. Trial Judge's Decision[16] The trial judge found that the Crown had established theactus reus of the sex offences charged to the requisitecriminal standard of proof. In his view, expressed at para. 4of his reasons [page487] [2010 ONSC 3093 (CanLII), [2010] O.J. No. 2764 (S.C.J.)], thesole issue was whether the Crown had also proven beyond areasonable doubt that the appellant \"failed to take allreasonable steps, or reasonable steps for Count #5 [theInternet luring charge], to ascertain the age of [E.B.]\".[17] The trial judge concluded, at para. 50 of his reasons,that the appellant \"did not take any steps let alone reasonablesteps\" to ascertain E.B.'s age after she initially told himthat she was 14 years of age. He found, at para. 50:[R]elying [on] the complainant's language and statementsindicating that she could be 14 years of age or older did notconstitute taking reasonable steps or all reasonable steps toascertain her true age in all the circumstances, especiallyafter being warned by her mother to stop all contact or shewould call the police and stating that the complainant wasway too young for him.[18] The trial judge summarized his conclusion on theInternet luring charge in this fashion, at para. 55:The [appellant] made no further inquiries and sought noadditional identification evidence other than an initial proforma inquiry as to the complainant's age. I find that theCrown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the[appellant] did not take \"reasonable steps\" or \"allreasonable steps\" to ascertain the age of the person andreasonable steps would include more than an initial pro formaquestion and reliance on statements made on an MSN internetchat line that indicated [E.B.] could be 14 years of age.V. Issues[19] There are two main issues on the conviction appeal:(1) Did the trial judge err in law by using the wrong test forassessing the sufficiency of the appellant's steps toascertain E.B.'s age (a) by applying the \"all reasonable steps\" rather than the\"reasonable steps\" standard in relation to theInternet luring charge; or (b) by applying a \"due diligence\", rather than a reasonablebelief, requirement in assessing the appellant'sconduct?(2) Did the trial judge further err in assessing thesufficiency of the appellant's steps to ascertain E.B.'sage (a) by failing to conduct the contextual analysis requiredunder ss. 150.1(4) and 172.1(4) of the Code; [page488] (b) by holding, in effect, that the appellant should haveapproached E.B.'s assertion of her age with a highdegree of scepticism; and (c) by requiring evidence of active conduct by theappellant to ascertain E.B.'s age?[20] The sole issue on the sentence appeal is whether thetrial judge erred by failing to reduce the appellant's overallsentence to take account of the strict terms and duration ofthe appellant's bail, contrary to R. v. Downes (2006), 2006 CanLII 3957 (ON CA), 79 O.R.(3d) 321, [2006] O.J. No. 555 (C.A.).VI. Analysis (1) Conviction appeal (i) Trial judge did not apply the wrong legal testsunder ss. 172.1(4) and 150.1(4) of the Code (a) \"Reasonable steps\" or \"all reasonable steps\"[21] As I have said, the appellant initially argued that thetrial judge erred in his assessment of the sufficiency of theappellant's steps to ascertain E.B.'s age by treating thestandards of \"all reasonable steps\" under s. 150.1(4) and\"reasonable steps\" under s. 172.1(4) of the Code asinterchangeable. During oral argument, he took no firm positionon whether there is a meaningful distinction between thesestandards, arguing generally that the trial judge erred byapplying the \"all reasonable steps\" standard, based on a duediligence approach, to the Internet luring charge.[22] I would reject both arguments. The trial judge's reasonsconfirm that he was fully alert to the difference in languagebetween the standards established under ss. 150.1(4) and172.1(4) of the Code. At the beginning of his reasons, at para.4 [2010 ONSC 3093 (CanLII), [2010] O.J. No. 2764 (S.C.J.)], the trial judge set out theissue to be decided in the case, stating: \"The issue to bedecided is whether the Crown has proven beyond a reasonabledoubt that [the appellant] failed to take all reasonable steps,or reasonable steps for count #5 [the Internet luring charge],to ascertain the age of the complainant.\"[23] Then, at the outset of the analysis section of hisreasons, at para. 40, the trial judge again indicated that the\"reasonable steps\" standard applied under s. 172.1(4) of theCode to the Internet luring charge (count 5). Further, at para.41, he noted that the \"all reasonable steps\" standard appliedunder s. 150.1(4) of the Code to the offences of sexual assault(count 1), sexual [page489] interference (count 2),invitation to sexual touching (count 3) and indecent exposure(count 6).[24] Thus, the trial judge was mindful of the differentlyexpressed thresholds under ss. 150.1(4) and 172.1(4) of theCode for proof of the sufficiency of steps taken to ascertain acomplainant's age.[25] I accept that it might have been preferable if the trialjudge had distinguished more clearly in his reasons between hisconsideration of s. 150.1(4), on the one hand, and s. 172.1(4)of the Code, on the other hand. That said, I agree with theCrown's submission that, in this case, any distinction betweenthe applicable standards under ss. 150.1(4) and 172.1(4) of theCode is of no moment.[26] I say this because, read as a whole, the trial judge'sreasons reveal that he ultimately concluded that theappellant's conduct in relation to ascertaining E.B.'s age metneither of the standards under ss. 150.1(4) and 172.1(4) of theCode. Recall his holding, at para. 50, that the appellant'sreliance on E.B.'s language and statements as confirmation thatshe was 14 years of age or older \"did not constitute takingreasonable steps or all reasonable steps to ascertain her trueage in the circumstances\" (emphasis added).[27] Moreover, the trial judge concluded, at para. 55 [2010 ONSC 3093 (CanLII), [2010]O.J. No. 2764 (S.C.J.)], that \"the Crown has proven beyond areasonable doubt that the accused did not take 'reasonablesteps' or 'all reasonable steps' to ascertain the age of theperson\" (emphasis added). He continued, at para. 57, that hewas not satisfied that \"the evidence introduced at trial raisesa reasonable doubt that the accused took reasonable steps orall reasonable steps to ascertain the age of [E.B.]\" (emphasisadded).[28] Thus, the trial judge found that the defence of mistakeof age was not made out because the applicable \"reasonablesteps\" threshold under s. 172.1(4) of the Code had not beenmet, just as the \"all reasonable steps\" standard under s.150.1(4) of the Code equally had not been satisfied. In thesecircumstances, as the Crown submits, it was unnecessary for thetrial judge to separately outline his interpretation andapplication of the standards established under s. 150.1(4) (inrelation to counts 1, 2, 3 and 6) and s. 172.1(4) (in relationto count 5). This case did not require a detailed analysis ofthe distinction, if any, between the two standards. Nor is suchan analysis required for the disposition of this appeal. On thetrial judge's unchallenged factual findings, the appellant'sconduct fell short of meeting either standard. [page490] (b) Due diligence or reasonable belief[29] The appellant further argues that the trial judge erredby employing the equivalent of a due diligence test, instead ofa reasonable belief test, in assessing whether the appellanttook reasonable steps to ascertain E.B.'s age. Morespecifically, he contends that the trial judge erred byinterpreting the phrases \"reasonable steps\" and \"all reasonablesteps\" under ss. 172.1(4) and 150.1(4) of the Code as mandatingan inquiry as to those steps that a reasonable person wouldhave taken to ascertain E.B.'s age, rather than an evaluationof whether a reasonable person could have believed that E.B.was 14 years of age on the basis of the information availableto the appellant.[30] I would also reject this argument.[31] In various parts of his reasons, the trial judgereferred to the steps that a reasonable person would have takenin the circumstances to ascertain E.B.'s age, in contrast tothe appellant's conduct. This approach did not reflect legalerror.[32] Relying on this court's decision in R. v. Thain, [2009]O.J. No. 1022, 2009 ONCA 223 (CanLII), the trial judge held [2010 ONSC 3093 (CanLII), [2010] O.J.No. 2764 (S.C.J.)], at para. 43, that the \"reasonableness ofthe steps taken to ascertain the age of the person must beassessed in context\". He further held, at paras. 46 and 47,that whether \"reasonable steps\" or \"all reasonable steps\" weretaken must be assessed on an objective, reasonable personbasis. These observations accord with the controlling legalprinciples. What constitutes \"reasonable steps\" in a given caseis a fact-specific inquiry that turns on the circumstances ofthe case.[33] The Supreme Court of Canada has described the s.150.1(4) \"all reasonable steps\" requirement as a \"due diligencedefence\": R. v. Hess; R. v. Nguyen, 1990 CanLII 89 (SCC), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 906, [1990]S.C.J. No. 91. Similarly, the British Columbia Court of Appealhas interpreted the applicable test under s. 150.1(4) as askingwhat steps \"a reasonable person would take in thecircumstances\" to ascertain a complainant's age: R. v. P.(L.T.), 1997 CanLII 12464 (BC CA), [1997] B.C.J. No. 24, 113 C.C.C. (3d) 42 (C.A.), atpara. 20. See, also, R. v. Hayes, [1991] A.J. No. 1232, 12W.C.B. (2d) 457 (Q.B.).[34] The appellant contends that the s. 172.1(4) \"reasonablesteps\" requirement applicable to the Internet luring chargemust mean something less strict. He points to the SupremeCourt's statement in R. v. Levigne, [2010] 2 S.C.R. 3, [2010]S.C.J. No. 25, 2010 SCC 25 (CanLII), at para. 31, that the s. 172.1(4)reasonable steps requirement \"was enacted by Parliament toforeclose exculpatory claims of ignorance or mistake that areentirely devoid of an objective evidentiary basis\" (emphasisadded). In the [page491] appellant's submission, this statementmeans that the reasonable steps requirement is met by proof ofsome objective basis on which a reasonable person could makethe same mistake of age asserted by the accused.[35] In my view, s. 172.1(4) requires an accused who claimsmistake of age to have exercised a degree of care inascertaining a complainant's age that a reasonable person inthe circumstances would have exercised. I say this for thefollowing reasons.[36] I note, first, that in Levigne, the Supreme Court upheldconvictions for child Internet luring, holding that the defenceof mistake of age is not available when an accused has failedto take \"the reasonable steps he was required by law to take\":see paras. 36-38 (emphasis in original).[37] Second, the plain language of s. 172.1(4) focuses onwhether an accused \"took reasonable steps\" to ascertain the ageof the complainant, not whether there was an objective basisfor the accused's honest belief in the complainant's age. AsLevigne confirms, at para. 41, s. 172.1(4) requires both thatreal steps be taken to ascertain the age of the person withwhom an accused is communicating and that those steps be\"reasonable\" in the circumstances.[38] Third, the statutory purpose of s. 172.1, the Internetluring provision of the Code, weighs in favour of aconstruction of \"reasonable steps\" that protects children byrequiring an accused to take more, rather than fewer,precautions in ascertaining a complainant's age.[39] Fourth, the \"reasonable steps\" language of s. 172.1(4)may be analogized to the requirement under s. 273.2(b) of theCode that an accused \"take reasonable steps, in thecircumstances known to the accused at the time, to ascertainthat the complainant was consenting\" in order to make out adefence of an honest but mistaken belief in consent against acharge of sexual assault. See R. v. A. (J.), [2011] 2 S.C.R.440, [2011] S.C.J. No. 28, 2011 SCC 28 (CanLII). This court has heldthat this provision \"requires the accused to act as areasonable person would in the circumstances by takingreasonable steps to ascertain whether the complainant wasconsenting\": R. v. Cornejo (2003), 2003 CanLII 26893 (ON CA), 68 O.R. (3d) 117, [2003]O.J. No. 4517 (C.A.), at para. 22, leave to appeal to S.C.C.refused [2004] S.C.C.A. No. 32.[40] The similarity in language between ss. 172.1(4) and273.2(b) of the Code lends further support to the conclusionthat a due diligence formulation of the \"reasonable steps\"requirement is appropriate in the s. 172.1(4) context, as it isunder s. 273.2(b). [page492][41] Finally, contrary to the appellant's submission, I seenothing in this court's decision in Thain that is inconsistentwith the application of a due diligence approach to the\"reasonable steps\" requirement of s. 172.1(4). As the trialjudge noted, Thain holds, at para. 37, that \"the reasonablenessof the steps taken to ascertain the age of the person must beassessed in context\". The contextual analysis mandated by Thainin no way conflicts with an assessment of the steps areasonable person would take in the circumstances to ascertainthe age of a complainant.[42] Accordingly, this ground of appeal also fails. (ii) Trial judge did not err in his assessment of thesufficiency of the appellant's steps to ascertainE.B.'s age (a) Requisite contextual analysis[43] The appellant attacks the trial judge's assessment ofthe sufficiency of his steps to ascertain E.B.'s age on severalfronts. He submits, first, that the trial judge essentiallyfailed to conduct the requisite contextual analysis todetermine if the appellant took \"all reasonable steps\" (inrelation to counts 1, 2, 3 and 6) and \"reasonable steps\" (inrelation to count 5, the Internet luring charge) to ascertainE.B.'s age. I disagree.[44] The trial judge recognized that the Crown bore the onusof proving that the appellant failed to take sufficient stepsto determine E.B.'s actual age and, as I have mentioned, heexpressly adverted to the objective and contextual nature ofthe sufficiency inquiry.[45] The trial judge's reasons indicate that he carefullyconsidered all the circumstances surrounding and the context inwhich the appellant's interactions with E.B. unfolded. Forexample, at para. 17 [2010 ONSC 3093 (CanLII), [2010] O.J. No. 2764 (S.C.J.)], the trialjudge described the evidence of E.B.'s consistent efforts toportray herself as older than she in fact was and, at paras. 23and 36, the steps taken by the appellant to ascertain E.B.'sage.[46] After doing so, the trial judge, at para. 39, set out 14factors that, in his view, indicated that the appellant hadfailed to take \"all reasonable steps\" to ascertain E.B.'s age.He then specifically addressed the evidence establishing thatthe appellant failed to take \"reasonable steps\" to ascertainE.B.'s age. This included evidence that(a) there was a significant age difference between theappellant (24 years of age) and E.B. (ostensibly 14 yearsof age) (para. 39(e)); [page493](b) the appellant failed to take further steps to ascertainE.B.'s age after he received a warning from E.B.'s motherthat E.B. was \"way too young\" (paras. 39(i), 49, 50 and52);(c) the appellant also failed to make further inquiries aboutE.B.'s age even after he was warned by E.B.'s mother thatif he contacted E.B. again, she would contact the police (paras. 39(i), 49, 50 and 52);(d) the appellant's communications with E.B. were mostly by MSNchats on the computer (para. 49);(e) E.B. might be under age because she was very small and hadthe body weight of an 11-year-old (para. 49); and(f) the appellant's sole inquiry about E.B.'s age, when hefirst met E.B. on the Internet chat room, was a pro forma,rather than an earnest, inquiry (para. 51).On the facts of this case, these were proper considerations inthe sufficiency inquiry.[47] Further, in assessing whether the steps taken by theappellant to ascertain E.B.'s age were sufficient to constitute\"reasonable steps\" within the meaning of s. 172.1(4) of theCode, the trial judge held, at para. 53 [2010 ONSC 3093 (CanLII), [2010] O.J. No. 2764(S.C.J.)]:The complainant looked young enough and small enough (shewas the weight of an 11 year old) to raise a suspicion aboutwhether or not she was 14 years old. Where in addition theaccused has met the young person on an anonymous internetchat site, where children who are under 14 years of age maybe participating, where there is a large age differencebetween them, where the accused was warned that thecomplainant was way too young and that she would call thepolice if he continued to contact the complainant, and hecontinued in secret. In these circumstances, I find that theCrown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accusedfailed to take reasonable steps to ascertain the age of E.B.(Emphasis added)[48] When the trial judge's reasons are carefullyscrutinized, it is clear that he took account of the fullcontext and circumstances in which the appellant's interactionswith E.B. took place for the purpose of determining thesufficiency of the appellant's efforts to ascertain her age.This ground of appeal therefore also fails. (b) Requirement for scepticism concerning E.B.'sasserted age[49] I reach a similar conclusion concerning the appellant'sclaim that the trial judge erred by holding, in effect, thatthe [page494] appellant should have approached E.B.'s assertionthat she was 14 years old with a high degree of scepticism.[50] The appellant submits that many of the circumstances ofthis case could have led a reasonable person to infer, as theappellant says he did, that E.B. was telling the truth when shesaid that she was 14 years old.[51] Again, I disagree. In my opinion, on any objectivestandard, the circumstances surrounding the appellant'sinteractions with E.B. were replete with warning signsregarding the truthfulness of E.B.'s claim that she was 14years of age.[52] The appellant met E.B. on a website that, by its natureand context, was attractive to young people. Further, thewebsite and the chat room were anonymous, containing noassurance of the accuracy of any postings. The appellanthimself lied about his age on the chat room, in order to appearyounger than he in fact was.[53] Moreover, from the beginning of his interactions withE.B., the appellant knew that there was a significantdifference in age between them: even if E.B. was 14 years ofage, as she claimed, she would have been ten years younger thanthe appellant.[54] And, again to the appellant's knowledge, E.B. was slightin build and young in appearance. The appellant viewed E.B. bywebcam and, later, in person, when they met at a hotel room inJanuary 2007. E.B. herself told the appellant that she had thebody of an 11-year-old.[55] In addition, the numerous chat records admitted at trialreveal that the appellant was fixated on E.B.'s diminutive sizeand appearance. They also reveal E.B.'s immaturity and the factthat she and the appellant discussed her friendships withpersons in grades 6 and 7.[56] Finally, this is a case where the accused was explicitlywarned that he was associating with an underage girl. E.B.'smother told the appellant that her daughter was underage, that,in effect, the appellant should have nothing further to do withher, and that, if she again discovered through her phone billsthat the appellant and E.B. had been in contact, she would callthe police.[57] Although the appellant contends that these starkwarnings from E.B.'s mother meant only that E.B. was under 18,rather than 14, years of age, the intended meaning of E.B.'smother's remarks is irrelevant. The important point is that theappellant was clearly and bluntly told that E.B. was too youngfor him and continued contact between the appellant and E.B.would trigger police involvement. [page495][58] I recognize that E.B.'s mother did not tell theappellant E.B.'s precise age. Nonetheless, in my opinion, it isinconceivable that her warnings to the appellant, whichdirectly called E.B.'s age into question, would not have givena reasonable person in the circumstances cause to doubt E.B.'sassertion of her age. Standing alone, these warnings weresufficient to put a reasonable person on further inquiryregarding E.B.'s actual age.[59] Thus, there were many, and varied, \"red flags\" that E.B.may not have been 14 years of age, as she claimed. To theextent, therefore, that the trial judge's reasons may be readas requiring the appellant to be highly sceptical of E.B.'sassertion that she was 14 years of age, I see no error. Indeed,taken together, the factors that I have describedoverwhelmingly support the conclusion that, in this case,sufficient steps to determine E.B.'s age necessarily includedheightened inquiry and scepticism regarding her professed age. (c) Requirement for active steps[60] The appellant also asserts that the trial judge erred inhis analysis of the sufficiency of the appellant's conduct byinterpreting the requirement of \"reasonable steps\" under s.172.1(4) of the Code as requiring active, rather than merelypassive, steps to ascertain E.B.'s age. He relies on severalpassages from the trial judge's reasons in support of thisassertion. For example, at para. 55 of the reasons [2010 ONSC 3093 (CanLII), [2010] O.J.No. 2764 (S.C.J.)], the trial judge found that the appellant\"made no further inquiries and sought no additionalidentification evidence other than an initial pro forma inquiryas to the complainant's age\". Further, at para. 56, the trialjudge stated:Where there is a substantial age difference between twopersons, one of whom is a young person, who meet on ananonymous internet chat group site and where there is apossibility that one is less than the age of 14 then I findtaking reasonable steps to ascertain the age of the youngerperson requires the accused to take steps beyond merelyrelying on a statement made on the internet by the youngperson that she is 14 years old.[61] The appellant submits that these and similar comments inthe reasons are tantamount to a finding that an accused musttake active steps to ascertain a complainant's age as aprerequisite to mounting the threshold of \"reasonable steps\"under s. 172.1(4). This, the appellant says, constitutes anartificial distinction between things an accused actively doesand information that he or she receives concerning acomplainant's age. The appellant argues that for the purpose ofthe limited defence of mistaken belief as to a complainant'sage, an accused [page496] is entitled to rely on informationconveyed to him or her, whether or not it is actively soughtout.[62] I do not accept that the trial judge erred in the mannerasserted by the appellant. Put simply, I do not read the trialjudge's challenged comments as holding that, as a matter oflaw, proof of active steps by an accused to ascertain acomplainant's age is a precondition to satisfying the\"reasonable steps\" standard set out in s. 172.1(4) of theCode. Rather, the trial judge determined the sufficiency of thesteps taken by the appellant to ascertain E.B.'s age on anobjective basis, in the light of the particular circumstancesand context of this case. This is what he was required to do.[63] I agree that the appellant was entitled to rely onE.B.'s representation of her age, when they first met on theInternet chat room, as one indicator of E.B.'s age. I did notunderstand the Crown to argue otherwise. Nor do the trialjudge's reasons suggest to the contrary.[64] I also agree that the appellant was entitled to rely onE.B.'s other actions in aid of her effort to appear 14 years ofage (for example, her statement that she was in grade 9, heruse of sexually explicit language in her communications withthe appellant and her claim that she had dated \"older guys\").[65] However, that does not end the matter. The question iswhether, on the totality of the circumstances, the appellant'sactions to determine E.B.'s age were sufficient to meet the\"reasonable steps\" standard established by s. 172.1(4) ofthe Code. The determination of this question required carefulexamination of all the circumstances surrounding theappellant's interactions with E.B. As I have already indicated,in my view, this is precisely the type of inquiry undertaken bythe trial judge.[66] The trial judge concluded that further steps by theappellant were required to meet the reasonableness standardunder s. 172.1(4) of the Code. I see no basis for interferencewith this conclusion. The full circumstances of this case,examined objectively, mandated further inquiry by the appellantregarding E.B.'s age. I have already described the multiple\"red flags\" suggesting that E.B.'s representation of her agemay be unreliable and that she may have been untruthfulregarding her age.[67] In particular, the warnings about E.B.'s age andpotential police involvement received by the appellant fromE.B.'s mother cried out for further steps by the appellant toascertain E.B.'s true age. In the absence of those steps, onthe facts here, the trial judge was fully justified inconcluding that the appellant had failed to make out thedefence of mistake of age regarding E.B. [page497] (2) Sentence appeal[68] The appellant grew up in a large religious family insouthern Ontario. He was the ninth of 17 children. The evidencebefore the trial judge on sentencing indicated that, by age 24,the appellant had never had a serious romantic relationship orengaged in sexual intercourse. He was described in his pre-sentence report as \"quiet and reserved\". He had no priorcriminal record or history of anti-social behaviour.[69] The appellant was arrested on January 19, 2007, detainedin custody and released on bail on April 2, 2007. Under theterms of his pre-sentence bail, he could not be out of his homeafter 9:00 p.m. in the evening and at all other times had to beaccompanied by a surety when he left his house. He remainedunder these strict bail terms for almost four years, until hewas sentenced on February 8, 2011.[70] The appellant says that his bail terms were akin to\"house arrest\" conditions. Relying on the decision of thiscourt in Downes, he argues that the strict terms and thelengthy duration of his pre-sentence bail warranted a reductionof 12 months from his total sentence of 23 months'imprisonment. He submits that the trial judge erred in hissentencing analysis by failing to take account of theappellant's \"house arrest\"-type bail in mitigation of sentence.[71] In Downes, this court held, at para. 33:[T]ime spent under stringent bail conditions, especiallyunder house arrest, must be taken into account as a relevantmitigating circumstance. However, like any potentialmitigating circumstance, there will be variations in itspotential impact on the sentence and the circumstances maydictate that little or no credit should be given for pre-sentence house arrest . . . [I]t is incumbent on thesentencing judge to explain why he or she has decided not totake pre-sentence house arrest into account. The failure todo so will constitute an error in principle[.][72] Subsequently, in R. v. Lawes, [2007] O.J. No. 50, 2007ONCA 10 (CanLII), at para. 10, and in R. v. Hunjan, [2007] O.J. No. 520,2007 ONCA 102 (CanLII), this court clarified that a sentencing judge'sfailure to refer in his or her reasons to bail conditions doesnot automatically constitute an error in principle.[73] And, in R. v. Ijam (2007), 87 O.R. (3d) 81, [2007] O.J.No. 3395, 2007 ONCA 597 (CanLII), at para. 36, this court held thatbail, even with stringent conditions, and pre-trial custody arenot to be regarded as equivalents in every case. MacPhersonJ.A., writing for a majority of a five-person panel of thiscourt on this issue, stated, at para. 37:[T]here will be cases -- Downes, with long-term house arrestbail conditions, is one -- where a sentencing judge shouldgive mitigation effect to pre-trial [page498] bail. However,there will be many other cases -- Lawes and Hunjan areexamples -- where this factor should attract little, if anyweight.[74] In this case, at trial, the Crown sought a totalsentence of three years' imprisonment (two years' imprisonmenton the Internet luring charge and a further 12 months'imprisonment on the remaining charges). The defence urged asentence of 12 months' imprisonment, less two-for-one creditfor pre-trial custody and less further credit of six or sevenmonths for time spent on restrictive bail conditions. If thisdefence submission had prevailed, the appellant's overallsentence may well have been in the order of one or two months'imprisonment.[75] The trial judge sentenced the appellant as follows:-- Internet luring -- 18 months' imprisonment, plus threeyears' probation;-- sexual interference -- four months' imprisonment,consecutive;-- possession of child pornography -- one month's imprisonment,consecutive;-- indecent exposure -- one month's imprisonment, concurrent tothe sentence on the possession of child pornography.Total: 23 months' imprisonment, plus three years' probation.[76] The appellant submits that, in crafting these sentences,the trial judge erred by declining, despite the defence requestat trial, to give the appellant any credit for the time spenton stringent bail conditions and to explain why such credit wasinappropriate. I would reject this submission.[77] To begin, while I accept that the appellant's bail termswere strict, he was not subject to house arrest bail.Nonetheless, in accordance with Downes and its progeny, I agreewith the appellant's submission that the terms and duration ofhis pre-sentence bail were relevant mitigating circumstances onsentencing. I did not understand the Crown to argue otherwise.[78] That said, I do not agree that the trial judge failed totake account of and afford the appellant's restrictive bail anymitigation effect. In my opinion, the trial judge's sentencingreasons undercut this contention.[79] When outlining the parties' positions on sentence, thetrial judge expressly noted [2011 ONSC 183 (CanLII), [2011] O.J. No. 536 (S.C.J.), atpara. 19]: \"The defence argues that a period of twelve monthsin jail would be appropriate with credit for the lengthy periodthat the accused has been subject to strict conditions while onbail.\" [page499] Thus, the trial judge was fully cognizant ofthe defence request for a reduction of the appellant's overallsentence based on his strict bail conditions.[80] The trial judge next reviewed ten mitigating and nineaggravating factors relevant to sentencing. He described thesecond mitigating factor as follows [at para. 21]: \"[Theappellant] followed strict bail terms for a lengthy periodwithout any breaches.\"[81] Then, after addressing the applicable principles ofsentencing and some of the authorities pertinent to the offenceof Internet luring, the trial judge imposed a sentence of 18months' imprisonment, plus three years' probation, on theInternet luring charge. He noted that this sentence reflectedthe mid-point of the range of 12 months' to two years'imprisonment mentioned by this court in R. v. Jarvis, 2006 CanLII 27300 (ON CA), [2006]O.J. No. 3241, 211 C.C.C. (3d) 20 (C.A.), at para. 31, asapplicable to the offence of child luring. As the partiesacknowledged during oral argument, this court recently held inR. v. Woodward (2011), 107 O.R. (3d) 81, [2011] O.J. No. 4216,2011 ONCA 610 (CanLII), at para. 58, that to the extent that Jarvis maybe read as establishing an appropriate range of sentence forchild luring -- a construction of Jarvis that this court didnot accept in Woodward -- this range needs to be revisedupwards given the 2007 amendments to the Code, doubling themaximum punishment for luring from five years to ten years.[82] After referring to Jarvis, the trial judge stated, atpara. 32 [2011 ONSC 183 (CanLII), [2011] O.J. No. 536 (S.C.J.)]:I have not given the maximum of the range due to the factthat the accused has no record and has taken active steps toobtain counselling and is at a low risk of reoffending. Theaccused has also been subject to strict bail conditions forthree and a half years without any breach.(Emphasis added)[83] The appellant argues that the above-quoted passage fromthe trial judge's sentencing reasons indicates that he tookaccount of the appellant's compliance with his bail terms as amitigating factor but that he failed to accord the restrictivenature and duration of the appellant's bail any mitigatingeffect.[84] I disagree. In my opinion, this is an inaccuratecharacterization of the sentencing reasons. There is no setformulaic language or magic phraseology for taking cognizanceof strict and lengthy bail terms as a mitigating factor onsentencing. Nor should there be. Downes and the cases thatfollowed it contain no suggestion of such a rigid andunrealistic approach to this issue. They do not require aprecise mathematical calculation of the credit to be given forpre-sentence bail. Nor do they mandate [page500] the manner inwhich a sentencing judge must consider restrictive bailconditions. They simply require that, in a proper case,mitigation effect should be given to pre-sentence bail. In thefinal analysis, the mitigating weight to be assigned to pre-sentence bail, if any, is a discretionary matter for thesentencing judge.[85] In this case, the trial judge expressly adverted to thelength of the appellant's pre-sentence bail (three times) andto the stringent nature of the terms of bail (also threetimes). Further, when explaining why he declined to impose asentence at the high end of what he understood to be theapplicable range for child luring, the trial judge specificallyreferenced the nature and duration of the appellant's bail, aswell as his compliance with it, as warranting a reduction insentence.[86] The appellant essentially contends that the trial judgeshould have said more in his sentencing reasons about theappellant's bail or phrased his consideration of this factordifferently. However, the trial judge was not required to doso. When the trial judge's sentencing reasons are read as awhole and in the context of the parties' positions on sentence,I think it indisputable that the appellant received mitigationcredit for the restrictive nature and duration of his pre-sentence bail. The trial judge made no error in principle inhis treatment of this issue.[87] Nor is the overall sentence imposed unfit. Thecircumstances of the appellant's luring of E.B. were serious.They included the pursuit of a vulnerable child, for sexualpurposes, over a sustained period (more than three and one-halfmonths), repeated pleas by the appellant for E.B. to expose herbreasts to him while he masturbated and exposed his genitalsvia webcam, the recording by the appellant of the images ofE.B. exposing her breasts, and a clandestine encounter in ahotel room (despite warnings from E.B.'s mother), where varioussexual acts short of intercourse were performed.[88] On the trial judge's findings, the appellant waspersistent and relentless in his pursuit of sexualgratification from E.B., and his conduct was consistent withgrooming E.B. As this court held in Woodward, at para. 43,grooming constitutes an aggravating feature in the offence ofluring. Woodward also holds, at para. 76, that in sentencingadult offenders for the exploitation of innocent children:While the effects of a conviction on the offender and theoffender's prospects for rehabilitation will always warrantconsideration, the objectives of denunciation, deterrence,and the need to separate sexual predators from society forsociety's well-being and the well-being of our children musttake precedence. [page501][89] Further, the appellant pleaded guilty to possession ofchild pornography, an aggravating feature in the context ofluring based on Jarvis, and was also found guilty of theadditional offences of sexual interference, indecent exposure,sexual assault and invitation to sexual touching. Theseoffences, even without the luring charge, call for asubstantial term of imprisonment.[90] The overall sentence imposed here was well within therange of sentences imposed for similar offences and similaroffenders. Indeed, in my opinion, it might well be viewed aslenient in all the circumstances.[91] I therefore conclude that the sentencing judge made noerror in principle and the overall sentence imposed wasentirely fit.VII. Disposition[92] For the reasons given, I would dismiss both theconviction and the sentence appeals.Appeal dismissed.Notes----------------Note 1: The appellant pleaded guilty to one count ofpossession of child pornography. Two other counts of possessionof child pornography were withdrawn at the request of theCrown.Note 2: In these reasons, I refer to those provisions of theCode in force at the time of the offences at issue in thiscase. Section 150.1(4) has since been amended to reflect theincreased age of 16 years for consent: Tackling Violent CrimeAct, S.C. 2008, c. 6, s. 54.----------------"}

He\npled guilty in Provincial Court to two charges, one under s. 344(b) and\nthe other under s. 733.1(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. The sentencing\njudge rejected a joint recommendation of imprisonment for terms totaling 33\nmonths, and imposed a term of 45 months for the robbery and one of two months\nfor breach of probation, the latter to be served concurrently.[2]Mr. Guignard applies for leave to appeal against the sentence for\nrobbery. He contends that the sentencing judge committed reversible error in finding,\nwithout supporting evidence, that the robbery was premeditated and in rejecting\nthe parties’ common submission. Counsel for the respondent was also counsel for\nthe Crown at the sentencing hearing. Not surprisingly, he also takes issue with\nthe sentencing judge’s rejection of the joint recommendation.[3]We allow the application for leave, but dismiss the appeal for the\nreasons that follow.I.The\nFactual Context[4]Shortly after midnight on July 23, 2004, Mr. Guignard attended at a bar in\nCampbellton where he passed the better part of an hour drinking beer, playing the\ncoin machines and sitting at a table. On his way out, Mr. Guignard told the\nbartender that: “tonight’s your lucky night.” Within the hour, he was back,\nbrandishing a knife and requiring that all the cash on hand be turned over to\nhim. Fearing for her life, the bartender complied. As she was handing Mr.\nGuignard the money (approx. $1,200), he told her to “take a good look at my\nface”. He left after warning the bartender not to call the police for another\nten minutes.[5]Information obtained in the robbery’s immediate aftermath quickly led police\ninvestigators to Mr. Guignard’s doorstep. However, they shied away from an\narrest at that time because Mr. Guignard did not fit the description provided\nby the bartender. They subsequently discovered that this was so because Mr.\nGuignard had shaved his head upon his return home following the robbery, a\nshort time before their attendance at his residence.[6]Most of the stolen money was never recovered.[7]The bar owner filed a victim impact statement in which he pointed out\nthat his loss was not covered by insurance and he reminded the sentencing judge\nof the risk of physical and psychological harm to the bartender posed by Mr.\nGuignard’s actions. The bar owner went on to add that Mr. Guignard’s crime was\nhampering his attempts at recruiting new employees.[8]In the court below, Mr. Guignard admitted to the following record of criminal\nconvictions:Place of OffenceDate of SentenceChargeSentenceSaint John, NB08/28/2002CC 342(3)Restitution - $1,900.00Probation – 2 yearsSuspended SentenceSaint John, NB08/28/2002CC 145(5)Probation – 1 yearSuspended SentenceSaint John, NB08/28/2002CC 463(c)Probation – 2 yearsSuspended SentenceBeresford, NB03/22/2004CC 355(b)(ii)Fine - $500.00; Surcharge -$0.00Saint John, NB03/24/2004CC 253(b)Fine - $1,000.00; Surcharge -$150.00Prohibition – 1 year (Operatinga motor vehicle/aircraft/vessel/railway)Saint John, NB03/24/2004CC 145(2)Provincialjail – 10 days[9]As noted, Mr. Guignard pled guilty and the Crown joined with the Defence\nin recommending a sentence of imprisonment for terms totaling 33 months.[10]The sentencing judge allowed a 2:1 credit (3 months) for time served\n(1.5 months) and, as noted, sentenced Mr. Guignard to imprisonment for 45\nmonths on the robbery charge.[11]As mentioned, counsel for the respondent takes the position that Mr.\nGuignard’s complaints are well founded. He joins Mr. Guignard in urging this\nCourt to substitute the sentence jointly proposed by the parties for the one\nimposed in the lower court. For the reasons that follow, we decline that\ninvitation.II.Analysis\nand DecisionA.The\nStandard of Review[12]The applicable standard is articulated in R. v. LeBlanc\n(G.A.) (2003), 2003 NBCA 75 (CanLII), 264 N.B.R. (2d) 341 (C.A.) at para. 17:A number of recent decisions including, among others, R. v.\nH.S.L. (2000), 2000 NBCA 54 (CanLII), 231 N.B.R. (2d) 358; 597 A.P.R. 358 (C.A.), at para. 28, R. v. Parent (D.)\n(2001), 2001 NBCA 60 (CanLII), 236 N.B.R. (2d) 370; 611 A.P.R. 370 (C.A.), at para. 8, R. v. R.P. (2001), 2001 NBCA 115 (CanLII), 245 N.B.R. (2d) 179; 636\nA.P.R. 179 (C.A.), at para. 11,\nR. v. Daigle (M.), [2002] N.B.R. (2d) (Supp.) No. 4 (C.A.), at para. 8, R. v. Kerton (R.E.) et al. (2002), 2002 NBCA 40 (CanLII), 250 N.B.R. (2d) 177;\n650 A.P.R. 177 (C.A.), at para. 25, and R. v. Kuriya (B.),\n2003 NBCA 63 (CanLII), [2003] N.B.J. No. 336; 261 N.B.R. (2d) 153; 685 A.P.R. 153 (C.A.), at paras. 20-21, stand for the\nproposition that intervention on appeal against sentence is inappropriate\nunless at least one of the following questions is answered affirmatively: (1)\nIs the sentence the result of an error of law? (2) Did the sentencing judge err\nin principle in the exercise of his or her discretion? (3) Is the sentence\nclearly unreasonable having regard to the fundamental purpose and objectives of\nsentencing (s. 718), as well as the principles enunciated in sections 718.1 and\n718.2 of the Criminal Code?[13]In our view, none of those questions can be answered affirmatively in\nthe case at bar.B.Premeditation[14]The sentencing judge found the robbery had been premeditated. Both Mr.\nGuignard and counsel for the Crown take issue with that finding, contending it\nis without evidentiary foundation. We do not share that view.[15]In our judgment, the primary facts set out above fully justify the\ninference that Mr. Guignard planned the robbery beforehand. It follows that the\nsentencing judge did not commit reversible error in making the impugned finding\nof premeditation.[16]Spur of the moment decisions to steal while armed with a weapon must be\nrare indeed. The uncontested facts of the present case argue with such\ncompelling force in favor of premeditation that we are at a loss to understand the\nobjection of counsel for the respondent to the sentencing judge’s finding on\npoint.C.The\nJoint Recommendation[17]In R. v. LeBlanc (G.A.), at para. 23, the Court recognized that\njoint recommendations on sentence “provide important guidance and carry\nconsiderable weight.” Joint recommendations express the views of those charged\nwith the primary responsibility of furthering the best interests of the accused\nand those of society as a whole during the sentencing process. As such, those\nrecommendations, while not legally binding, deserve serious consideration and\nought not to be disregarded lightly by sentencing judges.[18]In our view, a joint recommendation on sentence should be followed unless\nit is unreasonable. In that regard, we endorse the views of Fish, J.A. (as he\nthen was) in R. v. Douglas (2002), 162 C.C.C. (3d) 37 (Qc.C.A.) at\nparas. 42-43 and 51:Canadian appellate courts\nhave expressed in different ways the standard for determining when trial judges\nmay properly reject joint submissions on sentence accompanied by negotiated\nadmissions of guilt.Whatever the language used,\nthe standard is meant to be an exacting one. Appellate courts, increasingly in\nrecent years, have stated time and again that trial judges should not reject\njointly proposed sentences unless they are “unreasonable”, “contrary to the\npublic interest”, “unfit”, or “would bring the administration of justice into\ndisrepute”.[...]In my view, a reasonable joint submission cannot be said to “bring\nthe administration of justice into disrepute”. An unreasonable joint\nsubmission, on the other hand, is surely “contrary to the public interest”.\nAccordingly, though it is purposively framed in striking and evocative terms, I\ndo not believe that the Ontario\nstandard departs substantially from the test of reasonableness articulated by\nother courts, including our own. [R. v. Proulx, [2001] Q.J. No. 1485\n(QL) (Que. C.A.).] Their shared\nconceptual foundation is that the interests of justice are well served by the\nacceptance of a joint submission on sentence accompanied by a negotiated plea\nof guilty -- provided, of course, that the sentence jointly proposed falls\nwithin the acceptable range and the plea is warranted by the facts admitted.[19]In the case at bar, the sentencing judge concluded that the parties’\njoint recommendation called for the imposition of an unreasonable sentence. He\ncame to that view having regard to several aggravating circumstances, including\nthe fact that Mr. Guignard’s actions were premeditated, that those actions\nplaced the bartender’s life at risk, that most of the loot was not recovered, that\nMr. Guignard was on probation at the time of the robbery and that his record of\nprior criminal offences points to a troubling disinclination to abide by the\nlaw.[20]The judge also concluded - rightly in our view - that those aggravating\ncircumstances, viewed cumulatively, indicated that the recommendation in\nquestion strayed to an intolerable extent from the guidelines provided by this\nCourt in a number of decisions dealing with the subject of fit sentences for robbery.\nThese include R. v. Matthews (1983), 45 N.B.R. (2d) 265 (C.A.), R. v.\nBasque (G.) (1999), 1999 CanLII 9448 (NB CA), 211 N.B.R. (2d) 273 (C.A.) and R. v. Baldwin\n(M.) (2000), 2000 CanLII 20398 (NB CA), 232 N.B.R. (2d) 240 (C.A.). We point out that in Basque\nthe term of imprisonment imposed in the first instance (2 years) was not\nchallenged on appeal. That clearly emerges from paragraph 3 of the Court’s\nreasons for judgment. The only issue requiring adjudication in Basque\nwas whether the 2-year term of imprisonment should be served in the community\nor in jail. We emphasize that the Court did not give its imprimatur to the\nterm of imprisonment imposed in that case.[21]We are in full agreement with the reasons given by the sentencing judge to\nexplain his decision not to follow the parties’ joint recommendation on sentence.III.Disposition[22]For the reasons outlined above, the appeal against sentence is\ndismissed. While that decision disposes of the matter before the Court, we\nthink it appropriate to add the following.[23]Whenever an appeal against sentence is taken on the ground that the\nsentencing judge committed reversible error in not giving effect to a joint\nrecommendation on sentence, we question whether counsel who concurred in the\nrecommendation on behalf of the Crown should act as counsel for the Attorney-General\non the application for leave to appeal and the appeal. Counsel for the\nAttorney-General needs to focus on the following issue: Did the sentencing\njudge commit reversible error in disregarding the joint recommendation?Assuming the sentencing judge applied the standard articulated in these\nreasons, that issue will be resolved by answering the following question: Did\nthe sentencing judge commit reversible error in concluding that the sentence\njointly proposed fell outside the acceptable range? When counsel for the Attorney-General\non appeal is the very Crown counsel whose recommendation was discarded by the\nsentencing judge as unreasonable, it is unlikely that he or she will take a\ndispassionately objective view of the merits of the appeal against sentence.____________________________________J.

exceptional circumstances.2The appellant, at all\nrelevant times, was a 22-year-old student from Ghana attending Brandon\nUniversity.On December 4, 2000 he pled guilty to one count of possess weapon\ndangerous to the public peace, one count of uttering threats, and one of\nforcible confinement.On behalf of the appellant the Provincial Court was\nurged to consider a conditional discharge.Instead the judge imposed a\nconditional sentence of 12 months on each count to be served concurrently.The\nconditions of sentence were extensive and strict.3This is not the kind of\nsentence which would normally invite appellate intervention or, perhaps, even\nprompt an appeal.It is the special, almost bizarre, circumstances that led\nthis court to the unanimous conclusion that the trial judge erred in saying:“It’s my view that a conditional discharge in any form is not available for a\ncrime of this magnitude.It is contrary to the public interest.”4The appeal was allowed from\nthe bench.A conditional discharge was ordered accompanied by a two-year\nprobation order.The probation order was identical to that attached to the\noriginal conditional sentence.5Following are the brief\nwritten reasons which the court undertook to deliver.6On September 28, 1999 the\nappellant was living in the student residence at Brandon University.He came\nto this country under a policy endorsed by Brandon University and the\ngovernment of Ghana.He had been in Canada for only three weeks.That day he\nreceived a devastating e-mail message from his home in Ghana advising him that\nten of his friends, including relatives, had been killed.Although this news\nsubsequently turned out to be false, it shattered the appellant’s emotions and\ncaused him to feel personally guilty for what was alleged to have happened back\nhome.He went to the student lounge where he began to drink excessively until\nhe was very intoxicated.There is no suggestion that this was typical\nbehaviour for him.7The appellant, at some\npoint, attended to the room of a friend where he apparently planned to kill\nhimself.In his impaired state he also decided that he wanted to say farewell\nto other persons whom he had come to know.8There is no point going into\ndetail as to how the group of students ended up in one room or about every\ndetail of what happened.What is important to know is that the appellant became\nangry and irrational.He has little recollection and offers no justification\nfor what happened.9He refused to allow the\ncomplainants to leave.He continued to speak of killing himself and eventually\npicked up some knives which he held to his own chest and also made threats\ntowards the female complainants.Fortunately, before anything more violent\noccurred, the police arrived and the appellant was taken to the Brandon General\nHospital.10There is no doubt that the\nincident briefly described was terrifying or that it traumatized the\ncomplainants as they described in their victim impact statements.11Neither is there any denial\nthat the appellant’s behaviour was completely out of character.He has no\ncriminal record of any kind in Canada or in his homeland, and the many\nfavourable letters of reference that were tendered to the court describe an\nintelligent, ambitious, socially well-adjusted young man with a promising\nfuture.The trial judge was generally aware of these mitigating factors.However, he did indicate at the beginning of the hearing that he had “looked\nover the documents” but “I can’t say that I’ve been over them carefully.I\nsimply haven’t had the time.”Another mitigating factor of which the judge was\naware but appears to have been emphasized more in this court was the effect of\nthe entry of a conviction upon his immigration status.12Mr. Simmonds, counsel for\nthe appellant, assured the court that his client had a student visa only, that\nhe was definitely not a landed immigrant, and that immigration authorities had\nconfirmed that if a conviction for an indictable offence is entered, there will\nbe no option but to deport the appellant.The significance of the conditional\ndischarge is that under sec. 730(3) of the Criminal Code it is\nstipulated that if a court orders that an offender be discharged, that offender\nshall be deemed not to have been convicted of the offence.The importance of\nthis difference is abundantly clear.13In dealing with this\nsentence appeal we are, in fact, determining whether the appellant, with his\nfine past and promising future, and notwithstanding his genuine remorse, is\ngoing to have his prospects for a useful and successful future substantially\ncurtailed.14We must, of course, do this\nwithout ignoring the seriousness of the offences which bring him before the\nCanadian courts.15There is no purpose to an\nextensive review of the authorities that were cited, nor do we ignore the\nrespect to which a trial judge is entitled in the exercise of his discretion.Nonetheless, we believe that no more need be said than to express our view that\nthe trial judge failed to take into account all of the circumstances pertaining\nto the appellant and that he imposed a sentence that was unduly harsh.__________________________\nJ.A.I agree:__________________________\nJ.A.I

Ratushny of the Superior Court of Justice dated April 4, 2005.E N D O R S E M E N T[1]We are satisfied that the trial judge did not\nmisapprehend the facts.However, in our view, the trial judge erred in\nprinciple in two respects.[2]First, the trial judge held that the appellant’s\nplea to manslaughter fully accounted for the mitigating effect of the\nappellant’s intoxication at the time of the offence.We agree with Ms. Wheeler\nand Mr. Goddard that this holding is inconsistent with the decision of the\nSupreme Court of Canada in R. v. Stone, 1999 CanLII 688 (SCC), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 290.[3]Second, the trial judge erred in failing to give\nadequate weight to the appellant’s aboriginal status in accordance with s.\n718.2(e) of the Criminal Code and the decisions of the Supreme Court of\nCanada in R. v. Gladue, 1999 CanLII 679 (SCC), [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688 and R. v. Wells,\n2000 SCC 10 (CanLII), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 207.Although the appellant, like many native offenders, does\nnot reside on a reserve, the principles enunciated in those cases apply.See Gladue\nat paras. 90 and 91.The court is required to take judicial notice of\nthe systemic and background factors and the approach to sentencing that is\nrelevant to aboriginal offenders.See Gladue at para. 83.In any\nevent, we note that the appellant’s background of verbal, physical and\nemotional abuse at the hands of his stepfather and his own early abuse of\nalcohol and drugs is consistent with the systemic conditions that have plagued\nthe First Nations’ people.[4]Finally, the restorative approach need not take\nplace within or be specific to the aboriginal community.See Gladue at\npara. 92.There is the kind of plan in place contemplated by Gladue\nthat will assist the appellant with his treatment for substance abuse and to\nupgrade his education so that he may obtain employment.[5]While this was a very grave offence, the\nappellant, who was heavily intoxicated, was only a party to the offence and did\nnot administer any of the fatal blows.The appellant has no prior record for\ncrimes of violence and his longest prior sentence of imprisonment was four\nmonths in 1999.[6]Accordingly, we would grant leave to appeal,\nallow the appeal and reduce the sentence to fifteen months imprisonment.In\naddition to the credit of three years and nine months for pre-sentence custody\nthis is an effective sentence of five years imprisonment.[7]The appellant will also be placed on probation\nfor twelve months on the statutory terms and on condition that upon release he\nreport within two working days to a probation officer at Brockville and\nthereafter as required for the purpose of facilitating his attendance at Brock\nCottage and attendance at Algonquin College.The person releasing the\nappellant will comply with the provisions of s. 732.1(5) of the Criminal\nCode.Signed:“M.

Hambly of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting without\na jury.ENDORSEMENT[1]This is a sentence appeal. The appellant was\nconvicted after a guilty plea of fraud over $5,000 when, as a bank employee, he\ndisclosed personal financial information of bank clients to third party\nfraudsters, causing a loss of $500,000 to the bank and its exposure to civil\nliability of over $3 million. The appellant was sentenced to a term of\nimprisonment of two years less a day and a DNA order was imposed.[2]The appellant seeks a conditional sentence of\nthe same length. A conditional sentence is available because the offence was\ncommitted before the amendments to the Criminal\nCode, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, removing that option for\nfraud over $5,000. In the alternative, he seeks a reduction of his sentence to\n18 months.[3]The appellant also seeks to set aside the DNA\norder made by the sentencing judge.[4]The appellant makes three arguments on appeal.\nHe also seeks to introduce fresh evidence on his appeal.[5]First, the appellant says that the sentencing\njudge, in refusing a conditional sentence, failed to give effect to mitigating\nfactors. We disagree. The sentencing judge took into account the mitigating\nfactors of the appellant’s age, his drug addiction at the time of the offence\nand his completion of a drug rehabilitation program before sentencing, the\nabsence of a criminal record and the appellant’s strong support from his family\nand friends.[6]As the sentencing judge noted, the appellant\npleaded guilty in the face of overwhelming evidence. His plea occurred after a\npreliminary inquiry and a voluntariness voir dire. In these\ncircumstances, the guilty plea would not have been a significant mitigating\nfactor. In any event, there is nothing in the reasons or sentence itself to\nsuggest the guilty plea was ignored by the sentencing judge.[7]As for the suggestion that the appellant was\nentitled to a conditional sentence because he did not benefit from the fraud, in\nthe initial investigation by his employer, the appellant claimed his fraud had\nbeen motivated by threats to his girlfriend’s safety, while he advised the\nauthor of the pre-sentence report that the fraud was to pay off his drug debts.\nThe sentencing judge, based on his factual findings, rejected the appellant’s “girlfriend”\nstory. In any event, he did not treat greed as an aggravating factor.\nNevertheless, he accepted the role of the appellant’s drug addiction in the\nfraud and took that into account.[8]The primary sentencing objectives for this\noffence are general deterrence and denunciation. It is only when there are\nexceptional mitigating circumstances that a significant fraud with breach of\ntrust would warrant a conditional sentence. No such circumstances existed here.\nAccordingly, we reject this ground of appeal.[9]Second, the appellant says the sentencing judge\ngave insufficient reasons to explain the sentence. His focus, however, is on\nthe judge’s rejection of the “girlfriend” story.[10]The reasons for sentence were entirely\nsufficient and clear. There was no evidence to support what the appellant\ninitially said to his employer, which was contradicted by his own account to\nthe probation officer. The sentencing judge was entitled to regard the\nexplanation as “preposterous”, having regard to the appellant’s inability to\nprovide any information about the girlfriend’s current whereabouts. This ground\nof appeal is therefore rejected.[11]The fresh evidence confirms that the appellant\nhas successfully completed a substance use program and a harm reduction\nworkshop offered by Correctional Services, and has earned a high school level\nfour credit. While the appellant is to be commended for pursuing these courses\nand continuing his efforts toward rehabilitation, they have no material effect\non his sentence.[12]This was a large scale fraud that attracted a\nsignificant sentence. It had a serious financial impact on the bank and the\ntheft of customer identities affected numerous bank clients. All relevant\nfactors were taken into consideration in imposing a sentence of two years less\na day in prison. The sentence reveals no errors. But for the mitigating\nfactors, a penitentiary sentence would have been justified.[13]Finally, we would not interfere with the\ndecision to impose a DNA order. This was within the discretion of the\nsentencing judge, who gave reasons for the order. Having rejected the defence\ncontention that the appellant posed no risk of reoffending, the sentencing\njudge properly considered that the DNA order might well deter the appellant in\nthe future and that DNA evidence could be used in his apprehension. There is no\nreason to interfere with this discretionary order.[14]For these reasons, leave to appeal sentence is\ngranted and the appeal is dismissed.“Robert\nJ.

L.M., 2008 SCC 31 (CanLII): absent an error in principle, failure to consider a\nrelevant factor, or an overemphasis of the appropriate factors, a court of\nappeal should only intervene to vary a sentence imposed at trial if the\nsentence is demonstrably unfit.[14]The only matter relating to the\nfacts that requires comment arises from the Appellant’s submission that the\nsentencing judge found or assumed that he had hit T. with the golf club hard\nenough for the head of the club to fly off.[15]At the sentencing hearing, Crown\ncounsel initially read in as facts that the victim was awakened by the\nAppellant beating him with a golf club and that almost a week later the victim\ngave the police the head of a golf club that he claimed to have found in his\nroom.The police believed the head to belong to the club the Appellant beat\nthe victim with.[16]Defence counsel told the\nsentencing judge that the Appellant admitted that he hit the victim twice with\nthe golf club, one more time with the handle and then with his hands.Crown\ncounsel accepted those facts.However, even though it was not in the facts\nread in or agreed to, Crown counsel said in her submissions on sentence that\nthe Appellant swung and hit the victim so hard with the golf club that the head\nof the club came off.Although the Appellant’s admission that he hit the\nvictim with the golf club and then with the handle might lead to the inference\nthat at some point during the beating the head had come off, to say that the\nhead coming off was caused by the Appellant swinging the club and hitting the\nvictim went well beyond the facts put before the sentencing judge.[17]The sentencing judge did not,\nhowever, take up Crown counsel’s suggestion that the Appellant hit the victim\nso hard that the head of the club came off.She stated that “whether some of\nthe hits were with the golf club, some of the hits were with the handle, some\nof the hits were with your hands, it really does not make that much difference\nin the grand scheme of things”.There is no indication that the sentencing\njudge accepted that the Appellant had hit so hard with the club that the head\ncame off or treated that as an aggravating factor.[18]The sentencing judge found that\nalthough the total sentence sought by the Crown was not outside the usual\nrange, that might not be appropriate for a first offender.She considered\nwhether a community based sentence would be appropriate, but ruled it out\nbecause absent any indication that the Appellant had brought himself under\ncontrol, she was of the view that the community would be endangered.[19]The mitigating factors are the\nguilty plea, the lack of a criminal record and the Appellant’s relative\nyouthfulness.[20]It is an aggravating factor that\nthe Appellant attacked T. while he was in his own home, asleep.It is also an\naggravating factor that after being released on a recognizance for the assault\nwith a weapon and while awaiting trial, less than three months later the\nAppellant committed the second assault, which in itself involved two separate\nattacks on one individual.Neither this nor the earlier assault with a weapon\nwas minor; both involved considerable violence. While the breaches of\nrecognizance did not involve violence or threats, the breach involving C. was\nparticularly blatant in that it was not brief contact.[21]Although there were some positive\naspects to the pre-sentence report, the author of the report noted that while\nthe Appellant took responsibility, he expressed no remorse for the assault with\na weapon.There is no reference in the report to the second assault so it is\nunclear whether the author was aware of it.[22]The sentencing judge considered\nboth the mitigating and the aggravating factors.She did not fail to consider\nanything relevant, nor did she overemphasize any factor.[23]Sentences for non-sexual assaults\nare very fact-specific.In this case, on balancing the seriousness of the\noffences and the mitigating and aggravating factors, a ten month term of\nincarceration is not outside the range of sentences for this type of violent\nbehaviour.The term of probation imposed was appropriately intended to assist\nin the Appellant’s rehabilitation by including a clause for counselling and\nprograms to address anger management.The sentence as a whole addresses\nrehabilitation as well as denunciation and deterrence.[24]The Appellant says that the sentence\nhas had and will have a negative effect on some other aspects of his life, in\nparticular his plans for a career in the military.It is clear to me from the\nAppellant’s very thorough submissions, that since being sentenced he has given\na great deal of thought to his situation and the impact on his life of the\noffences he committed.That is to his credit.That being said, however, the\ninformation provided to the sentencing judge was less definite than the\nAppellant’s assertion on the appeal that he was in the process of entering the\narmed forces.The pre-sentence report indicates that although he took\ntraining in 2009, he declined the position he was offered with the military;\nhis counsel’s submissions on sentence referred to a number of different employment\noptions the Appellant was considering.The sentencing judge did not ignore the\nAppellant’s plans, as he submits, in that his plans were uncertain.[25]Even if the Appellant has decided\nsince then that entering the military is the way to go, that is not a factor\nthat can now affect the sentence that was imposed by the sentencing judge.It\ndoes not make the sentence unfit.Nor is the length of time before the\nAppellant might be granted a pardon an appropriate consideration.[26]In all the circumstances, the\nsentences imposed are not unfit and the appeal from sentence is therefore\ndismissed.V.A.

(N.W.)))Judgmentdelivered:(YoungPerson, Accused) Appellant)September 5,2008MONNIN J.A.1This is an appeal\nfrom a sentence imposed under the provisions of the Youth Criminal Justice\nAct (the Act) following a plea of guilty to a charge of first degree\nmurder.2The sentence\nimposed on the accused was the maximum sentence prescribed under the Act,\nnamely one of ten years, of which the first six years were to be served\nin custody to be followed by four years to be served under supervision in the\ncommunity.3The accused, who\nspent 238 days in custody prior to his plea and imposition of sentence, appeals\non the basis that under the provisions of s. 38(3) of the Act, he\nshould have received a credit for his pre-disposition detention and therefore\nthe custody portion of his sentence should have been less than the six years\nimposed.That section reads:Factors to be considered(3) In determining a youth sentence, the youth justice\ncourt shall take into account.....(d) the time spent in detention by\nthe young person as a result of the offence;.....4The plea and\nsentence came about as a result of a joint recommendation that the accused not\nbe transferred to adult court and that a ten-year sentence be imposed.The\njoint recommendation, however, was unclear as to how that ten-year period was\nto be broken down.The Crown argued that notwithstanding the provisions of s.\n38(3) of the Act, the sentence should be one of six years’ custody,\nwhilst the accused argued that the time served should be deducted from that\nperiod.5In imposing his\nsentence, the sentencing judge said:The young offender has spent time in detention\nand that time should be acknowledged.I do so now but I do not give that time\nany extra credit.….I do not think that time in detention should result in\nless time in custody because of the circumstances of the offence and the\nconsequences of the offence.6The sentence to\nbe imposed for first degree murder is set out in s. 42(2)(q) and (r)\nof the Act.The section provides:Youth sentence(2) When a youth\njustice court finds a young person guilty of an offence and is imposing a youth\nsentence, the court shall, subject to this section, impose any one of the\nfollowing sanctions or any number of them that are not inconsistent with each\nother and, if the offence is first degree murder or second degree murder within\nthe meaning of section 231 of the Criminal Code, the court shall impose\na sanction set out in paragraph (q) or subparagraph (r)(ii) or\n(iii) and may impose any other of the sanctions set out in this subsection that\nthe court considers appropriate:.....(q) order the\nyoung person to serve a sentence not to exceed(i) in the case of\nfirst degree murder, ten years comprised of(A) a committal to\ncustody, to be served continuously, for a period that must not, subject to\nsubsection 104(1) (continuation of custody), exceed six years from the date of\ncommittal, and(B) a placement\nunder conditional supervision to be served in the community in accordance with\nsection 105, and.....(r) subject to subsection (7), make an intensive\nrehabilitative custody and supervision order in respect of the young person(i) that is\nfor a specified period that must not exceed(A) two years from\nthe date of committal, or(B) if the young\nperson is found guilty of an offence for which the punishment provided by the Criminal\nCode or any other Act of Parliament is imprisonment for life, three years\nfrom the date of committal,and that\norders the young person to be committed into a continuous period of intensive\nrehabilitative custody for the first portion of the sentence and, subject to\nsubsection 104(1) (continuation of custody), to serve the remainder under\nconditional supervision in the community in accordance with section 105,(ii) that is\nfor a specified period that must not exceed, in the case of first degree\nmurder, ten years from the date of committal, comprising(A) a committal to\nintensive rehabilitative custody, to be served continuously, for a period that\nmust not exceed six years from the date of committal, and(B) subject to\nsubsection 104(1) (continuation of custody), a placement under conditional\nsupervision to be served in the community in accordance with section 105, …7In arguing that\nhe should have received a credit for time in custody, the accused relies on R.\nv. K.E.J.L., 2006 MBCA 120 (CanLII), 208 Man.R. (2d) 185, and R. v. K.C., 2007\nMBCA 117 (CanLII), 220 Man.R. (2d) 191, two decisions from this court.As well, he\nrelies on R. v.\nB. (T.) (2006),\n2006 CanLII 4487 (ON CA), 78 O.R. (3d) 721 (C.A.), a decision referred to with approval in R. v.\nK.E.J.L., and a\nrecent decision from the British Columbia Supreme Court, R. v. Van Buskirk, 2007 BCSC 1924 (CanLII), which also relied on R. v. B. (T.).8The Crown’s reply to the accused’s argument is\nthat the consideration of the time in custody requirement under s. 38(3) of the\nAct is but one of the factors to be considered under all of the\nprovisions of s. 38 and that such a requirement is to be given no preferred\nstatus over other sections of the Act.9Cases subsequent\nto those relied upon by the accused would seem to give credence to the Crown’s\nargument.10The most recent\nof those decisions is from the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. B. (D.),\n2008 SCC 25 (CanLII), 231 C.C.C. (3d) 338.Although the case does not speak directly to\nthe issue before us, there appears to be a tacit acceptance by all members of\nthe court, whether in the majority or the minority, that a youth justice court\njudge may impose the maximum sentence even when the offender had already spent\nsignificant time in pre-sentence custody.The Supreme Court of Canada upheld\nthe sentencing judge’s decision, which stated (at para. 14):You are to be the\nsubject of an intensive rehabilitative custody and supervision order for a\nperiod of three years, and committed into a continuous period of intensive\nrehabilitative custody for a period of thirty months and serve the remainder of\nthe sentence under conditional supervision in the community in accordance with\ns. 105 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act.In my view the\nmaximum period of a youth sentence is necessary to achieve the desired ends of\nthe rehabilitation programme, and for that reason I have not given credit for\nthe one year period of pre-trial custody.11It also appears that the Ontario Court of Appeal\nhas altered its approach to this issue following its decision in R. v. B.\n(T.).In R. v. E.L. (2006), 2006 CanLII 12290 (ON CA), 210 O.A.C. 124, a 17-year-old offender pled guilty to first\ndegree murder and to using a firearm during the commission of an indictable\noffence.Based on counsel’s joint recommendation, the youth justice court\njudge sentenced the accused to six years’ closed custody and two years’\ncommunity supervision on the murder charge and 14 months’ closed custody and\nseven months’ community supervision on the weapons charge.In imposing these\nsentences, the youth justice court judge gave the accused three months’ credit\nfor the 17.5 months he spent in pre-sentence detention.On appeal, the accused\nargued that the youth justice court judge erred by failing to give him credit\nfor all of the time he spent in pre-sentence detention.The court rejected\nthat argument, saying (at paras. 9-10):….In our view, properly read, this\ncourt’s decision in T.B. confirms that s. 38(3)(d) obliges a youth\njustice court in all cases to take the time spent in detention by a young\nperson as a result of the offence in issue into account in fashioning a\nsentence.This does not mean, however, that in taking such detention into\naccount, the youth justice court does not have discretion to determine the\nappropriate credit to be given.T.B. recognizes that it is only in an\nexceptional case, such as this one, where a court should exercise that\ndiscretion to reduce the credit given below one to one.In light of the joint submission in this\ncase and the extensive negotiations concerning the rehabilitative needs of the\nappellant, we are satisfied that the youth court justice made no error and that\nthe sentence imposed is fit. ….12That same court reached a similar result in R. v. Ferriman, 2007 ONCA 710 (CanLII).In that case, the accused was found guilty of manslaughter.He was sentenced\nas an adult; the sentence imposed was two years less a day incarceration and\nthree years of probation.The accused spent three years in pre-sentence\ndetention.The accused sought to have his sentence reduced to one year in\nlight of his lengthy pre-sentence detention.The court stated (at para. 8):Finally, we see no merit in the submission\nthat the trial judge erred in failing to give enhanced credit for pre-trial\ncustody.…. The trial judge looked at all the circumstances and fashioned a\nsentence that was appropriate, including allowing the appellant to remain in a\nprovincial youth facility.13Most recently, the Ontario Court of Appeal again\naddressed this issue in R. v. D.W., 2008 ONCA 268 (CanLII).The case involved\nthe offence of second degree murder.Because he thought he had to deduct the\ntime the accused spent in pre-sentence detention, the sentencing judge chose to\nsentence the accused as an adult rather than as a youth.The Ontario Court of\nAppeal held that this was an error.The court stated (at paras. 2-3):In concluding that a youth sentence would\nnot sufficiently hold the appellant accountable for his admittedly heinous\noffence, the trial judge determined that he was required to give the appellant\nfull credit for the two and a half years he had already spent in pre-trial\ncustody.The trial judge then concluded that a further eighteen months in\ncustody would neither hold the appellant sufficiently accountable nor promote\nhis rehabilitation.The trial judge’s approach was in error\nbecause although he was required to take pre-trial custody into account, he was\nnot required to directly deduct the time spent in pre-trial custody.Instead,\nthe trial judge had broad discretion to take pre-trial custody into account as\na consideration in deciding whether the appellant would serve a youth or an\nadult sentence.14In the result, the court allowed the appeal, set\naside the original sentence and instead imposed the maximum youth sentence for\nsecond degree murder, without any additional credit for the two-and-a-half\nyears the accused spent in pre-sentence detention.15Another recent appellate judgment on this issue,\nconsistent with this more recent trend in the Ontario jurisprudence, was\nrendered by the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal in R. v. L. (J.R.), 2007\nNSCA 62 (CanLII), 221 C.C.C. (3d) 278.In that case, the accused pled guilty to several\noffences arising out of a violent home invasion.He was sentenced to six\nmonths’ deferred custody and 18 months’ probation.He also spent 16 days in\npre-sentence detention.It was therefore argued that “since JRL served 16 days\nin pre-sentence custody a six month deferred custody order was not permitted.Pre-trial custody has to be taken into account and if it had been in this case,\nthe maximum period of deferred custody was exceeded” (at para. 23).As further\nexplained, the Crown argued that “since credit must be given for the 16 days\nspent on remand, the sentence was, in effect, six months and 16 days, which is\nillegal” (at para. 41).In reaching its decision, the court noted the contrast\nbetween R. v. B. (T.) and R. v. E.L.It chose not\nto follow R. v. B. (T.).Roscoe J.A. stated (at paras. 47-48):…. In my view, the time spent in\npre-sentence detention can be “taken into account” without expressly giving\nspecific credit for time served by deducting the number of days or some ratio\nof that number from the number of days of a custodial sentence.When the\nsentence imposed is not a custodial sentence to be served in an institution,\ntaking the remand time into account does not necessarily have to result in a\ndeduction in the length of sentence.It can be taken into account by reducing\nthe type or severity of the sentence.Although the judge in this case erred in\nprinciple because he did not specifically take the remand period into account,\ngiven the brevity of the remand, it is not an error that should necessarily\ncause a change of disposition if the sentence is otherwise fit. …. To deduct\nthe 16 days from the six month deferred custody portion of the sentence would\nmake little sense at this point, now that it has been completely served.16Another decision that appears to follow the\nOntario Court of Appeal’s more recent treatment of this issue is that of R.\nv. B. (L.A.), 2007 ONCJ 538 (CanLII).In that case, the 14-year-old accused pled guilty to second degree\nmurder.The accused spent close to two years in pre-sentence detention.As\nnoted, “both the Crown and defence jointly submit that should L.A.B. be\nsentenced as a youth, the sentence imposed should be the maximum sentence\navailable for a youth found guilty of second degree murder in addition to\npre-trial custody” (at para. 62).Watson J. held as follows (at para. 73):The maximum sentence of seven years is the\nmost serious punishment provided by law for the offence of second degree murder\ncommitted by one who is to be treated as a youth.I have taken the time spent\nin pre-trial detention into consideration in determining the section 72 issue\nas a factor in my conclusion that the maximum youth sentence would be\nsufficient to hold L.A.B. accountable.… I need not take it into account again\nin determining the length of the youth sentence to be imposed.17There is one\nfurther area that merits consideration and that is from cases decided under the\nCriminal Code itself.In R. v. S. J. L., 2005 BCSC 177 (CanLII), Bouck J. held that “[t]he Criminal\nCode cases are helpful in deciding how Youth Court judges should determine\nwhether the offender should get credit for their pre-trial detention and how a\njudge should calculate that credit” (at para. 48).Indeed the Ontario Court of\nAppeal in R. v. B. (T.) relied on R. v. Wust, 2000 SCC 18 (CanLII), [2000]\n1 S.C.R. 455, and R. v. Fice, 2005 SCC 32 (CanLII), [2005] 1 S.C.R. 742 to reach\ntheir decision.One such recent case is that of R. v. Mathieu; R. v.\nSt-Germain; R. v. Jin; R. v. Monière, 2008 SCC 21 (CanLII), 231 C.C.C. (3d)\n1.18Fish J., writing for a\nunanimous court, set out the issue to be addressed in that appeal in these\nwords (at para. 1):The question on which these four appeals\nturn is whether a sentence of imprisonment of less than two years is exactly\nthat – a sentence of less than two years – within the meaning of the Criminal\nCode even where the judge would have imposed a penitentiary term but for\nthe offender’s pre-sentence custody (sometimes referred to as “pre-trial\ncustody”).19The court answered this\nquestion in the affirmative.In the four cases on appeal, the offenders had\nall spent significant amounts of time in pre-sentence custody.For this\nreason, the judges imposed custodial sentences of less than two years; but for\nthe pre-sentence custody, the judges would all have imposed penitentiary\nterms.The issue was whether the judges were allowed to make the probation\norders that they did.As Fish J. summarized, “[i]n short, I find that the term\nof imprisonment in each case is the term imposed by the judge at the time of\nsentence.The offender’s prior detention is merely one factor taken into\naccount by the judge in determining that sentence” (at para. 6).Importantly,\nFish J. characterized the court’s prior decisions in Wust and Fice as\nexceptions (at para. 7):Although it is possible, on an exceptional\nbasis, to treat the time spent in pre-sentence custody as part of the term of\nimprisonment imposed at the time of sentence – in the context of a minimum\nsentence, for example, or of a conditional sentence – these are\nexceptions that prove the rule.As to minimum sentences, see R. v. Wust,\n[2000] 1 S.C.R. 455, 2000 SCC 18 (CanLII), 143 C.C.C. (3d) 129, 184 D.L.R. (4th)\n385; regarding conditional sentences, see R. v. Fice, [2005] 1 S.C.R.\n742, 2005 SCC 32 (CanLII), 196 C.C.C. (3d) 97, 252 D.L.R. (4th) 575.20Fish J. noted that “[i]n virtue of s. 719(4), a\nterm of imprisonment commences ‘on the day on which the convicted person is\narrested and taken into custody under the sentence’.….Pre-sentence custody\ncan thus hardly form part of a sentence that has not yet commenced” (at para.\n14).21And further (at para. 19):Manifestly, the words “imprisonment for a\nterm not exceeding two years” used by Parliament in s. 731(1)(b) refer\nto the custodial term imposed at the time of sentence – the actual term of\nimprisonment imposed by the court after taking into account any time spent in\npre-sentence custody.22It is therefore conceivable, in my view, that\nthese recent comments by the Supreme Court of Canada also call into question\nthe holding of the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. B. (T.), which\nrelied on both Wust and Fice.23On the basis of the cases to which I have\nreferred, I am unable to conclude that the sentencing judge erred when he\ndeclined to grant the accused any credit for the time he served in pre-sentence\ndetention.Those cases lead to the inescapable conclusion that a sentencing\njudge must consider the time spent in detention in determining an appropriate\nsentence – which he did – but that he is not bound to, especially in cases where\nthe maximum sentence or near maximum sentence is imposed, give any credit to an\naccused for that time spent in detention – which is what the judge did in this\ncase.24Accordingly, I\nwould dismiss the appeal.J.A.I agree:C.J.M.I agree:J.A."}

At a later date, he also admitted his\nguilt to the summary conviction offence of using a firearm without reasonable\nprecautions for the safety of others. Following a sentence hearing on both\nconvictions, the judge imposed the following sentences:-for\nthe assault: 8 months incarceration, probation for three years with conditions\nthat he report to a probation officer, refrain from being in possession of any\nfirearm and to attend such clinics for alcohol rehabilitation as deemed\nadvisable by the probation officer and finally, pursuant to s.100 of the Criminal Code, an order\nprohibiting him from possessing any firearm or ammunition for a term of ten\nyears and an order confiscating three firearms including the one used in the\ncommission of the offence.-at\nthe same time, he imposed a concurrent sentence of 4 months imprisonment for\nthe summary conviction offence. That sentence was reduced to time served by a\nJudge of the Court of Queen's Bench sitting on appeal.Mr. Coughlin appeals from the conviction and seeks\nleave to appeal the sentence imposed for the indictable offence.On the appeal from conviction for the offence of\nassault causing bodily harm, counsel for Coughlin argued that the intermingling\nof an indictable offence and a summary[Page 2]conviction offence in the sentencing process rendered\nthe conviction for assault invalid. Counsel did not point out any authorities\nin direct support of this proposition.The two guilty pleas occurred at different times. The\nconvictions were validly entered. There was one sentence hearing but two\ndifferent sentences. The trial judge distinguished between both offences and\ndid not confuse them. I would dismiss the appeal from conviction.Leave to appeal sentence is sought on the following\ngrounds:1.I was not given an opportunity to\nspeak on sentence to both charges.2.The trial judge erred in\nspeculating on matters not before him which unduly and improperly effected the\nsentence.3.There was no legal justification\nfor an order in forfeiting all my guns.4.The trial judge failed to\ndistinguish between the information with two (2) counts, one (1) of which was\nwithdrawn and the new information.5.The trial judge failed to take\ninto consideration the mitigating circumstances of:i.the accused being a cripple\n(i.e., one leg);ii.the son badly beating up his\nfather;iii.the son had been told to leave\nhis father's battery alone.I would grant leave to appeal sentence.[Page 3]The judge found there had been \"growing\nantagonism\" between the appellant and his 20 year old son. On the day of\nthe offence, Mr. Coughlin, who has only one leg, saw his son removing a battery\nfrom his [the father's] car. When the son did not stop as demanded, Mr.\nCoughlin went in the house and returned with a shotgun. He fired a shot in the\nground to scare his son away from the car. The son ignored the warning, and\ncontinued to remove the battery.Mr. Coughlin then approached his son and struck him\nin the face with the butt of the shotgun breaking some teeth and cutting the\ninside of his mouth. The son took the gun away from his father and broke it. He\nthen struck his father in the face several times. The two are now reconciled,\nand the son has moved away from home. At the time of these incidents, Mr.\nCoughlin was under the influence of alcohol. The father paid $3,000 for\ntreatment to his son's teeth.In the circumstances, I am of the opinion that the\nsentence of eight months is excessive. The trial judge failed to consider\ncertain mitigating factors. Particularly, the fact that the dispute had been\ngoing on for a while between the father and the son. The son was younger and\nstronger. The father paid for the medical and dental repairs. Moreover, the\nCrown did not prove that the son owned the battery so that in effect a weaker and\ncrippled father was attempting to protect his property from a rebellious son.\nThus, the judge should have considered that the guilt resulted from the use of\nexcessive force in a defensive way, rather than force from an aggressive act.In fact, if the son had not attempted to take the\nbattery from his father's car, or had heeded the warning shot, there would have\nbeen no injury and no criminal act by the[Page 4]father. The same factor applies for the alcohol. It\njust happened that Mr. Coughlin was under the influence of liquor when his son\ndecided to take the battery.In my opinion, a person who creates a situation by\nhis criminal conduct cannot be heard to complain if the victim overreacts and\nuses excessive force against him. That is also a factor to be considered by the\njudge who imposes a sentence on the user of excessive force.The appellant was previously convicted of two summary\nconviction offences of impaired driving, and one offence against the Excise Act involving tobacco. The trial judge, correctly, made\nno comment other than that there was no previous record of violence.In addition, the judge made an order of prohibition\npursuant to s.100 (1) of the Code, prohibiting Mr. Coughlin\nfrom possessing any firearms or ammunition for the minimum period of ten years.\nSuch an order, before the section was amended, was mandatory. Now the judge\nmust consider the factors provided in ss.(1.1) (1.2) and (1.3). In order to do\nthis, he must give the accused an opportunity to establish some of these\nfactors. That opportunity was not given in this case. The order of prohibition\nmust be quashed as having been made without jurisdiction.This latter point was not raised in the Notice of\nAppeal, but because it goes to jurisdiction it is proper to consider it on\nappeal. See Salhany, Canadian Criminal Procedure 6th Ed. (Aurora: Canada Law Book, 1994) at 9-37.\nMoreover, the Crown presented arguments on the point. See also Thibodeau v. Clavet (1975), 11 N.B.R. (2d) 32 (N.B.C.A.).[Page 5]Since, in this case, there is already in the\nprobation order an order of prohibition with respect to firearms, and\nconsidering the circumstances, I would not make any order pursuant to s.100.The last ground of appeal involves the Order\nforfeiting to the Crown three firearms owned by Mr. Coughlin. The Order was\nmade pursuant to s.491(1) of the Criminal Code. That section authorizes forfeiture of a weapon\ndetermined by a court to have been used \"in the commission of an offence\".\nIn this case, only one firearm was used in the commission of an offence, the 12\ngauge shotgun.Accordingly, I would set aside the order of\nforfeiture as it applies to the two .22 rifles. They may be returned to Mr.\nCoughlin upon the expiration of the probation order or be turned over to a\nperson lawfully entitled to have a firearm as directed by Mr. Coughlin.For these reasons, I would allow the appeal from\nsentence, set aside the sentence of imprisonment and direct that the imposition\nof sentence be suspended. I would maintain the three years probation order and\nthe forfeiture order for the 12 gauge shotgun. I would quash the order pursuant\nto s.100 of the Code and set aside the part of the forfeiture order which\ndeals with the two .22 rifles.[S]J.-C. ANGERS, J.A.I CONCUR:[S]PATRICK A. A. RYAN, J.A.HOYT, C.J.N.B.I have read the decision of Mr. Justice Angers and I\nagree with him that the appeal from conviction should be dismissed and that the\nappeal against the forfeiture Order made under the provisions of s.491 of the Criminal Code of\nCanada be allowed. I would not,\nhowever, allow the appeal against the sentence of eight months imprisonment\nimposed by Cain, P.C.J. for assault contrary to s.267(1)(b) of the Criminal Code.Mr. Coughlin, who was drinking at the time of this\nincident, became involved in a dispute with his son over an automobile battery.\nAccording to the uncontradicted statement of facts made by Crown counsel at the\nsentencing hearing, the dispute occurred in the yard of Mr. Coughlin's home.\nMr. Coughlin went into his house where he obtained a 12 gauge shotgun. He\nreturned to the yard with the gun. He then loaded the gun, pointed it at his\nson and fired a shot \"at the ground a few feet\" from where his son\nwas standing. When this effort to scare his son failed, Mr. Coughlin struck his\nson on the side of his face with the butt of the shotgun, breaking several\nteeth and causing a laceration inside his son's mouth.This is Mr. Coughlin's first conviction for an\noffence involving violence. He had, however, been convicted for three other\noffences in the previous four years. Two of the offences, like this incident,\ninvolved alcohol. In my view, the sentence of eight months imposed by the sentencing\nJudge was well within the range for this offence in the circumstances that\nexisted here. The Judge's finding that the assault was premeditated is\nsupported by the uncontradicted facts related by Crown counsel. Mr. Coughlin\nleft the dispute to get a shotgun, returned with it, loaded it, pointed it at\nhis son and then fired it a few feet from his son. He then struck him in the\nface with the butt of the gun. However much Mr. Coughlin's judgment may have\nbeen clouded by alcohol, it appears that he[Page 2]had no difficulty in executing his plan. No matter\nhow much he believed himself to be in the right about the automobile battery,\nhe cannot take the law into his own hands.I would also uphold the Judge's Order made under\ns.100(1) of the Criminal Code.\nThe Order prohibits Mr. Coughlin\nfrom possessing a firearm or ammunition for ten years. Parenthetically, I would\nnote that this issue was not raised in either Mr. Coughlin's Notice of Appeal\nor Submission. If an offence involves violence for which ten years or more\nimprisonment may be imposed, a s.100(1) order is mandatory, unless the accused\ncan satisfy the judge that he or she is within the exemption created by\ns.100(1.1) of the Code.During the sentencing hearing, Crown counsel drew s.100\nto the Court's attention and, although it was unnecessary to do so as the\nprohibition is mandatory, he asked for a firearm prohibition. Mr. Coughlin was\nthus specifically put on notice that such an order could be made. In spite of\nthat, neither Mr. Coughlin nor his counsel, when they spoke, attempted to\nsatisfy the Court that Mr. Coughlin should be exempted. I agree with Mr.\nJustice Angers that before a firearm prohibition is imposed, the accused must\nhave an opportunity to satisfy the court that he falls within the exemption\ncreated by s.100(1.1). But when an accused, as happened here, does not take\nthat opportunity, he cannot later complain.For the above reasons, I would dismiss the appeal\nagainst sentence.[S]CHIEF\nJUSTICE OF NEW BRUNSWICK"}

MATTEODefendant______________________________________________________________________SENTENCE______________________________________________________________________Introduction[1]On September 7th 2017, defendant Lino P. Matteo\nwas found guilty of having contravened the Securities Act, namely\nsections 196 and 197[1],\nand section 202[2]\nwith reference to section 208. That judgment should be considered as if recited\nat length in the present sentence.[2]An investigation followed the bankruptcy, in\n2006, of Mount Real Corporation (MRC), whose chief executive\nofficer was the defendant at the relevant period of 2000 to 2005.[3]Although the defendant attested that MRC’s\nfinancial statements complied with the Generally Accepted Accounting\nPrinciples (GAAP), the evidence showed beyond any doubt that the\nfinancial situation of MRC during that period could not have been as\npublished in any of its financial statements. A great number of investors were attracted\nto a formidable but false performance.[4]The fact that MRC was conducted in total\ndisregard of the applicable GAAP resulted in liabilities of $135 million\nincluding the investors’ promissory notes. The investors’ proof of claims\ntotalled $108 million.[5]Following\nan application for a class action settlement order[3], the settling\ndefendants have contributed the aggregate sum of $43,236,431 intended to\ncompensate the class action members for their loss.[6]Lino Matteo is not one of\nthe settling defendants. It is now 12 years that Mr. Matteo is\nbefore different courts and it is not over.[7]His conviction and sentence in what was called the Cinar\ncase are pending before the Quebec Court of Appeal[4] and the notice of appeal of\nmy judgment rendered on September 7th 2017 was filed on November 3rd 2017 in the\nSuperior Court.[8]On June 22nd 2016[5],\ndefendant was sentenced to serve 7 years and 11 months following his conviction\nby a jury on one count of having defrauded Cinar Corporation, four\ncounts of forgery and four of uttering forged documents. Except for the count\nof fraud, the counts for which he was found guilty by a jury cover the period of\nDecember 1st 1997 to December 31st 2000.[9]The issues addressed in the present instance span from 2000 to\n2005. Unlike the case of R. c. Lacroix[6], where\nVincent Lacroix faced penal and criminal charges stemming from the same\nfacts, the penal accusations here stem from facts that are different from the Cinar\ncase and the period is also different.[10]In the decision mentioned above, the Honourable\nRichard Wagner, now sitting on the Supreme Court of Canada, dismissed a Requête\nen res judicata et en arrêt des procédures,\nwhereby Vincent Lacroix\nargued that his conviction of the penal accusations prevented a criminal\ntrial on the same facts. Although the Tribunal was of the opinion that Lacroix\nhad established a sufficient factual link with some of the penal charges and\nthe criminal ones, he had not established a sufficient legal link between\nthe two legislations, namely the Criminal Code and the Securities Act.[11]In rejecting Lacroix’s motion, Judge Wagner also\nconcluded that in some circumstances, which existed in that case, the same\nbehaviour based on the same facts could attract different infractions and\naccusations.[12]He upheld the criminal charges to which Vincent\nLacroix pleaded guilty a month after the decision. He imposed on Lacroix a\nsentence of 13 years to be served consecutively to that of 5 years less a day\npronounced by the Court of Appeal following Lacroix’s successful sentence\nappeal of the decision rendered on January 28th 2008 by my colleague the\nhonourable Claude Leblond.[13]Invoking section 241 of the Quebec Code of\npenal procedure, the AMF is seeking a sentence of 5 years less a day,\nconsecutive to the one imposed by the Superior Court[7] on June 22nd 2016 along with\nmultiple fines totalling close to $5 million for the defendant Lino P.\nMatteo.[14]Defendant is of the opinion that section 241\ndoes not apply since he is not in detention presently, having been released by the\nCourt of Appeal pending his conviction appeal in the Cinar case.[15]In releasing the defendant on December 13th 2016,\nthe Honourable Nicholas Kasirer of the Court of Appeal said “that the immediate\nenforceability of the appellant’s conviction and sentence can legitimately\nyield to the temporary suspension of the sentence while conviction is\nunder review before this court”.[16]The sentence pronounced in June 2016 is\ntherefore temporarily suspended, not annulled. I conclude that defendant was\nsentenced for offences committed before the ones for which he was found guilty\nin September 2017. The present sentence can therefore be consecutive.Defendant’s position on sentence[17]Defendant is of the opinion that the minimum\nfine applicable in the year 2000 on each and every count should suffice in view\nof the delays it took for the prosecution and the different courts to bring his\ncases to an end. He would have suffered great prejudice since he was not\nallowed to work in his field of accounting.[18]It is to be noted that if defendant obtained his\nCertified Management Accounting designation in 1988, he lost it\nin 2008 when he was barred from the CMA’s Order. He also pleads that his\ncompliance with the bail conditions he was imposed in the fraud case of Cinar\nshould be considered as well in the present sentence.[19]He makes a parallel with the sentence of Guy\nDrouin[8],\nwhereby the latter, following a 14‑month jury trial preceded by 2 years\nof preliminary motions, was found guilty and received a conditional sentence of\n6 months.[20]When the representations on sentence were made\nin the Drouin case, the Honourable Johanne St-Gelais raised the now well-known\ndecision of the Supreme Court in Jordan, stating that the fact that the\nprosecution had decided to reunite, in the same trial, multiple chapters of the\nsame investigation, had, as a consequence, that certain accuseds were kept in\nthe same trial when they were concerned with only part of the investigation.[21]During weeks and\nmonths, they attended court during the presentation of evidence that did not concern them, to such an extent that they were authorized\nto be absent considering the impact that such a situation had on them.[22]Judge St-Gelais also took into consideration\nthe fact that elements of the investigation, although relevant, did not justify\nthe presentation of such voluminous evidence.[23]This is not at all\nthe same situation here. On June 26th 2017, I dismissed a motion for a stay of\nproceedings due to unreasonable delays filed by Laurence Henry, a co‑defendant of Matteo, and Matteo himself. In my decision, I found that the AMF\nhad tailored its different prosecutions stemming from the Mount Real\nshutdown. As well, I found that there was no other way to present the\nevidence against the administrators of MRC without having to go through\nthe extensive forensic analysis the experts had made, which meant having to go\nthrough the immense documentary evidence gathered during the investigation.Analysis[24]Reading the decision of my colleague Claude Leblond[9], who sentenced Vincent\nLacroix on January 28th 2008, I was appalled at the similarities between the two\ncases. Adopting a controlling management, Lacroix, who was the head of\ndifferent societies in the securities field and had a key role in the management\nof 27 investment vehicles, deprived investors of $115 million. He blamed\neveryone but himself and argued he had a plan that would have permitted the\ninvestors to recuperate the lost funds.[25]Lino Matteo, who was at the top of the Mount\nReal group, comprised of 88 different societies, is still convinced that had\nit not been for the intervention of the provisional administrator named by the\nMinister of Finance following a decision of the Commission des valeurs\nmobilières du Québec (CVMQ), MRC could have survived.[26]Despite the fact that defendant Matteo acknowledged\nthe liabilities of MRC in an amount of $135 million[10], to this day, he still\nclaims that the provisional administrator turned a “manageable situation into a\ndisaster”. Like Lacroix, he had a plan to save MRC. Unfortunately, it\nwas rejected by the investors and by the Superior Court.[27]In one of the judgments rendered in the context\nof Mount Real’s bankruptcy, the Honourable Jean-Yves Lalonde of the\nSuperior Court had this to say concerning MRC’s relaunching plan[11]:Malgré l’enchevêtrement corporatif\ncomplexe, un seul homme décidait de tout, Lino P. Matteo. Mount Real était\nla pierre angulaire et le siège de toutes les décisions. C’est elle qui avait\nla maîtrise de l’administration des biens de toutes ses filiales. Celles-ci ne peuvent aujourd’hui prétendre à leur\nautonomie et leur indépendance afin de soustraire de la faillite de\nMount Real des biens sur lesquels elles n’ont jamais eu de pouvoir.Et plus important encore, dans le\ncas de Sterling Services, les bons de commande (Purchase Orders) ne furent que\ndes conventions d’accommodation dont les signataires (Klein et Clément) ne\nconnaissaient aucune modalité. Tout cela n’est que fumisterie, tromperie et\nmanigance ourdie par des gens perfides et sans vergogne au mépris flagrant\nd’investisseurs, dont on a abusé de la confiance. Le droit du Québec n’accepte\npas cette manière de faire des affaires.[28]Like Vincent Lacroix, defendant Matteo blames\nthe prosecution and the experts who, according to him, failed to understand the\nbusiness model and structure of MRC.[29]In\nmy judgment, I said that what the witnesses described went beyond mere\nnegligence or mismanagement. As in the Lacroix case, it contained all\nthe elements of a premeditated and deliberate fraud in which Lino P. Matteo\nplayed a key role, showing total disregard not only for the applicable\nprinciples but for everyone who dared to slow down his ambitions. In that\nsense, his moral blameworthiness is at the highest level.[30]The example I cited in my judgment[12] concerning the MRAC\ntransaction is only one amongst many examples of Lino Matteo’s ways. What his\ninterlocutors in the Bahamas considered of utmost importance in order to\nconduct a transaction of this importance was, to Mr. Matteo, sheer ‘’stupidity’’\nhe did not have time to deal with.[31]And we have to conclude that he had no time to deal with the difficulties\nhis employees had with the investors’ or the representatives’ concerns.[32]Laraine Lyttle was an employee of Mount Real.\nOn May 4th 2005, she wrote an email[13]\nto Laurence Henry and Joseph Pettinichio which was forwarded to Lino Matteo for\ndiscussion. The subject was Cash flow. In capital letters, she writes PLEASE\nREAD and then the following:As you\nare both aware we are unable to cover our redemptions. Now it has gotten to the\npoint we cannot pay any interest owing or partial interest/redemptions for RIF\npayments. Frank Iacono has an investor, N.C.[14], who holds about 850,000.00 US and\n1.35 M Canadian we are unable to pay his 6,500 US of interest for his\nApril interest for the beginning of the month. B2B Service fee account is at\nrock bottom so if there are any purchases through them they will not be able to\nissue a cheque to us anyway. The whole situation is getting worse every day. I\nhave worked years to have a good relationship with the reps now this is in\njeopardy.And she concludes in capital letters PLEASE HELP.[33]Representatives[15]\nwrote about INTERESTS PAYMENTS due to their clients who had been waiting for\nmonths and who were expecting their money. One representative wrote she was fed\nup of playing a game of cat and mouse.[34]Another one writes[16] that after the maturity\nextension from March to June, it is time to reimburse the clients because we\nare out of excuses!!! so please let’s respect our deal. He wants answers\nand talking about his clients, he writes: Don’t wait they call the guy from\nLa Presse!!![35]To this, Lino Matteo answers the following: You\nare smiling when you are saying this… right?If you have any issues, I\nthink you should discuss with Laurence. The representative answers that he\nis not smiling at all.[36]In exhibit P-440 doc id 2674038, a June 2005\nemail addressed to Laurence Henry and cc’d to Lino P. Matteo, Laraine Lyttle\nwrites : This situation is impossible how long will I have to tell reps and\ninvestors that the records are not accessible?[37]Exhibit P-440 doc\nid 2674042 shows that on August 24th 2005, Mrs. Lyttle wrote an email to Lino\nP. Matteo, which subject was HELP. An investor, Mr. S.[17], had\nbeen in her office and would not leave without speaking to someone. She\nexplains that he holds close to $1 million in MRACS and he had an\ninterest payment of $34,000 due on August 3rd 2005. She asks defendant to\nsee him. Mr. Matteo’s answer was: Did you call Laurence?[38]She replies that the man has already spoken to\nLaurence, he is not happy with his conversation with him and she does not want\nto repeat what he said. On August 26th, defendant wrote that he would get\nan update from Laurence about this.[39]On August 29th at\n10:14 A.M., Mrs. Lyttle writes to Mr. Matteo, who shares the same office as Mrs.\nLyttle, that Mr. S. is back after having stayed for three hours the last time.[40]Here is Lino P. Matteo’s answer to the situation.\nIf he is waiting quietly, go along with your work, if not ask him to leave\nand keep the door locked.[41]What is left to think from those examples,\namongst many others, is that defendant, who self-portrayed himself as having a\ndomineering authoritarian style and someone who wanted things to be done and to\nbe done right, showed cowardliness, hiding behind others, putting on their shoulders the burden of explaining\nthe unexplainable.[42]After having lied to investors who were lured\nto invest massively in MRC and other companies of the Mount Real\ngroup, he was locking the door in order to avoid having to answer questions,\nshowing nothing else than contempt for everyone. How can someone ever think he\ncould have any preoccupation for the investors?[43]I cannot find any mitigating factors on\nsentence. And again, to this day, defendant has shown no insight or sense of\naccountability. Only that he is sorry.[44]As was said in many decisions, if the absence of\nany criminal record is usually a mitigating factor, in the context of the Securities\nAct, it has less or no value at all. After all, any ordinary citizen would\ntrust the person or company he invests his money with and would expect these people\nto have no criminal record.[45]All the aggravating factors considered in the Lacroix\ndecision are present here:1)the exceptional degree of planification and\ncomplexity of the scheme, starting with the existence̶or shall I say the non-existence̶of all those companies, many of them empty\nshells used to inflate MRC’s balloon;2)the five‑year period during which the\ninfractions were committed;3)the first-hand role of the defendant;4)the abuse of the trust and the manipulation that\naffected many people, not only investors;5)the amount of money involved and the large number\nof investors;6) The post-offence conduct,that is reflected in the\njudgment of the Honourable Jean-Yves Lalonde of the Superior Court, cited above,\nalong with the fact of blaming the provisional administrator for a situation defendant\nis personally responsible for.[46]Although the following words of the Honourable\nRichard Wagner[18]\nwere pronounced in sentencing Vincent Lacroix in a fraud case, they totally\napply in the present situation:Il est vrai que Vincent Lacroix n’a\npas été l’auteur de violence physique dans la perpétration de ses crimes. C’est\nd’ailleurs l’une des raisons pour lesquelles il a pu recouvrer sa liberté sous\ncaution en attendant la tenue de ses procès.Cependant, même si la violence\nphysique directe n’a pas accompagné ses crimes, le Tribunal est d’avis que ces\nderniers ont engendré beaucoup de violence morale aux victimes et à leur\nfamille en raison du stress, de l’insécurité et de l’incertitude pour ceux et\ncelles qui ont perdu le capital de leur vie qu’ils réservaient pour leur retraite.[47]The few testimonies I have heard from investors\nconfirmed that. Some attended large parts of the trial. If revenge has no place\nin a court of law, I can only hope that today puts an end to a sad period of\ntheir lives.[48]Mtre Bordelais for\nLino Matteo pleaded that the prosecution overcharged the accused and that two statements of offence would have sufficed: one for all\nthe false information charges over the five-year period and one englobing all the\ncounts of having aided to the distribution of securities without a prospectus\nduring the same period.[49]With respect, I don’t think this would have been\nan accurate account of what the evidence revealed at trial.[50]In my judgment, I wrote that although the public\nfinancial information transmitted took multiple forms for a given year, I excluded\nthe possibility of staying the proceedings on certain counts because each and\nevery document, disseminated each and every year to the public, had the\npotential in itself to impact on any person with the will to invest, whatever\nthe document consulted, whatever the year.[51]The same applies to all the counts concerning\nthe distribution of securities without a prospectus. Each promissory note has a\ndifferent date and involves the investment of a different person or different\ninvestments of the same person but at different times.[52]Therefore, the defendant is liable to the penalty\napplicable at the time indicated on each statement of offence. For counts 1 to\n27, a minimum fine of $5,000. On counts 28 to 75 and 267 the minimum fine of $5,000\nand the maximum penalty of 5 years less a day[19].\nFor counts 108 to 154, 156 to 163, 165 to 207, 209 to 212, 214 to 266, 268 to\n305 and 308, the minimum fine of $5,000.[53]This is a case where the sentencing objectives\nof denunciation and deterrence of the defendant, but also of others who would\nbe tempted to adopt the defendant’s way of doing business, should be\nprioritized.[54]The fact that the defendant could not work in\nhis field of accounting for the past 10 years weighs less in view of the damage\nhe caused. After having considered all the evidence, this can only be considered\nas an unavoidable consequence of his own actions if not a blessing for\npotential investors.[55]Mr. Matteo testified that in the last four years,\nhe had a few consulting projects and also that he has worked as a soccer\nreferee for the past 10 years, which had a therapeutic effect. His wife and\nsons support him and he still lives in his house. He testified that in 2005,\nhis portfolio, which was 95% linked to MRC, was evaluated at $8 million.[56]The AMF agrees that the total fine that will\nbe imposed on him is more symbolic than anything else. Apparently, Mr. Matteo\nwould not have the means to pay such a fine. Then the same question lingers: Where\ndid the investors’ money go?Although defendant testified on sentence that he\nnever transferred any money offshore, the evidence clearly showed that this was\ndone on a regular basis. Not only in the Bahamas and Barbados[20] but also in the United\nStates[21].[57]Whether or not Mr. Matteo pays the fine, the\neffect of it plus the time he will serve in jail shall have a deterrent effect\non any person wishing to build a little empire like Mr. Matteo thought he was\nbuilding.[58]Exhibit S-5 is the Tableau de la poursuivante\nquant à la peine réclamée. For counts 1 to 27,\nthe AMF is asking 4 times the minimum fine of $5,000. For counts 28\nto 75 and 267, 2 times the minimum fine of $5,000 and an\nimprisonment of 5 years less one day to be served concurrently on each count. Finally,\nfor counts 108 to 154 , 156 to 163, 165 to 207, 209 to 212, 214 to\n266, 268 to 305 and 308, 4 times the minimum fine of $5,000.[59]It is certainly an exemplary sentence. Having heard\nthis trial during many months, appreciating the whole of the evidence, the\ndefendant’s first‑hand role and character, I am convinced that it is a fit\nand legitimate sentence that takes into consideration the sentencing objectives\nof denunciation and deterrence. It is also necessary to separate defendant from\nsociety in order to promote a sense of responsibility in him and acknowledgment\nof the harm he has done[22].\nThe fact that he is sorry does not right a wrong.[60]It should not to be forgotten also that other\nadministrators of MRC are still awaiting trial.[61]It is without any hesitation that I endorse the\nrecommendation of the AMF on sentence. Consequently, on counts 1 to\n27, the defendant is sentenced to pay a fine of $20,000 on each\ncount. On counts 28 to 75 and 267, he is sentenced to pay a fine\nof $10,000 on each count and to serve 5 years less one day\nconcurrently on each count.[62]On the remaining counts 108 to 154, 156 to\n163, 165 to 207, 209 to 212, 214 to 266, 268 to 305 and 308, the defendant\nis sentenced to pay a fine of $20,000 on each count.[63]The total sentence is therefore an imprisonment\nof 5 years less a day consecutive to any other sentence and a fine of\n$4,910,000.__________________________________HÉLÈNE MORIN, J.C.Q.Mtre Stéphane POULINMtre Mairi SPRINGATEMtre Amélie ROYCounsel for the Autoritédes marchés financiers (AMF)Mtre Sylvie BORDELAISAttorney for Lino P.Matteo[1]Having aided Mount Real Corporation (MRC) to\npresent false and misleading information (75 counts).[2]Having aided subsidiaries of MRC to make distribution of securities\nwithout a prospectus (190 counts).[3]S-3.[4]500-10-006191-165.[5]S-1 and S-4.[6]2009 QCCS 4004 (CanLII).[7]The Right Honourable Pierre Labrie, J.C.S.[8]2016 QCCS 4933 (CanLII).[9]2008 QCCQ 234 (CanLII).[10]ExhibitP-611 D.[11]2007 QCCS 351 (CanLII).[12]Page 27, par. 207.[13]P-440 doc id 2674028.[14]The name is written in full in the email.[15]P-440-2674035.[16]P-440-2674036.[17]The name is written in full.[18]R. c.

(Oral):G.H.\nis before me for sentencing on a single count of assault with a weapon which\narises in something of a domestic context.G.H. and A.L. have been in a\nrelationship off and on for several years.A.L. has three children and G.H., I\nunderstand, has stood in the place of a father to those three children.However, in December of this past year, A.L. indicated that she wished them to\ntake a break from the relationship.[2]On the particular\nevening in question, G.H., having dropped off the children with A.L.’s mother,\nhappened to be passing her residence, noted an unknown vehicle there, and there\nwere some indicators to him that someone was present with her in the residence.He became angry, broke into the residence, damaging a window and a door.He\nentered into the bedroom, where he found the complainant, P.S., and asked that\nhe leave the residence.G.H. then, unfortunately, went to the kitchen, grabbed\na knife and returned to the bedroom.It is my understanding through the\npre-sentence report that this was a small steak knife.However, he confronted P.S..There was a struggle during which there was apparently an attempt to stab P.S.,\nwho was, fortunately, able to block the use of the knife.G.H. then head-butted\nhim twice in the nose area, resulting in swelling and bleeding.No other\ninjuries were reported and, in particular, the knife itself was not actually\nused in terms of cutting anyone.A.L. contacted the police and G.H. left the\nresidence.[3]He comes before the\nCourt with a prior criminal record.It is a record which is, in its entirety,\nrelated to G.H.’s significant history of drug addiction.It includes a number\nof drug-related offences and breaches, reflecting his difficulty in complying\nwith conditions at times when he is actively using.This is, as the Crown\npointed out, an offence which is serious enough that it could quite rightly\nattract a penitentiary term.[4]G.H., you need to\nunderstand that the potential for serious injury or worse, in this case, was\npretty high.I know from the Pre-Sentence Report that you are aware of that\nand that you are concerned about what you have done and the impact that it has\nhad on others.You have entered a guilty plea, which is indicative to me of remorse,\nas well.[5]I do have a joint\nsubmission before me from counsel suggesting that this matter be resolved by\nway of an 18 month conditional sentence followed by a two year probationary\nterm.As I said, this is the type of offence for which one might otherwise be looking\nat a penitentiary term.In this case, obviously, counsel, as am I, are agreed\nthat there are somewhat exceptional circumstances.[6]I have a great deal of\ninformation before me in the form of a very thorough and complete Pre-Sentence\nReport, as well as detailed letters from a number of individuals, including G.H.’s\nemployer, A.L., his mother and his step-father, all of which speak quite frankly\nabout G.H.’s history, background and his current circumstances.Of particular\nnote to me, G.H., while having had a relatively stable early upbringing,\nappears to have developed significant problems with drugs in his teens,\nfollowing the divorce of his parents.[7]Both he and A.L. have a\nhistory of struggling with drugs and coming into conflict with the law as a\nresult.However, this is one of those cases in which they both appear to be\ndoing extremely well right now in managing their addictions.G.H. spent some\ntime in custody a couple of years ago with respect to a drug-related offence,\nbut since shortly after his release he has maintained sobriety.He has been\nclean, and A.L. has as well, over two years, and it might even be more than\nthat, I think, three years now, of being clean and sober.Both of them have\nmade significant strides, but it is clear to me from the reports that doing so\nhas not been without some struggles and glitches along the way as they continue\nto work through their issues individually and, to some extent, at least before\nthis incident, together as well.[8]In considering what is\nbeing suggested here, one of the things that I think is crucial is that there\nhas been a significant reduction in G.H.’s risk level as a result of the fact\nthat he has stayed clean.I think his ability to maintain his sobriety is\ncrucial to his not coming into conflict with the law in the future.I tend to\nagree with his mother’s comment that his ability to do so may well drop\ndramatically in a custodial situation, where he is with a number of individuals\nwho struggle with similar addictions, and it is not unheard of that various\nsubstances do get smuggled into such facilities.So when I am balancing off\nthe issues that need to be addressed here, in terms of denunciation and\ndeterrence, as well as rehabilitation, I am satisfied that adopting the joint\nsubmission in allowing G.H. to serve his custodial term within the community is\nthe best balance of all of those principles.[9]Case law is clear that\na conditional sentence can meet the principles of denunciation and deterrence and,\nas I have said, in terms of G.H.’s rehabilitation, placement in the community\nwith the support that he has from his family is pretty crucial to his\ncontinuing efforts to address his addiction issues.[10]That being said, I\nwould adopt the joint submission of counsel.G.H., there will be a sentence of\n18 months with respect to the single count that you have entered a plea to.You will, however, be entitled to serve that conditionally within the\ncommunity.The terms and conditions of the conditional sentence will be as\nfollows:1.That you keep the peace and be of good\nbehaviour;2.Appear before the Court when required to do\nso by the Court;3.That you report to a Supervisor\nwithin two working days and thereafter when required by the Supervisor and in the\nmanner directed by the Supervisor;4.That you remain within the Yukon\nTerritory unless you have written permission from your Supervisor and notify\nyour Supervisor in advance of any change of name, address and promptly notify\nyour Supervisor of any change of employment or occupation;5.You are to reside as directed by\nyour Supervisor; abide by the rules of the residence and not change your\nresidence without the prior written permission of your Supervisor;[11]There does need to be a\nrestrictive house arrest component, in my view, and I do note that I have also\nconsidered the fact that you have been on house arrest for a number of months\nin passing sentence.That is one of the other factors that I think weighs in\nfavour of granting you a conditional sentence, but I am going to include the\nsame condition that you have been on as part of your conditional sentence order,\nwhich will require you to:6.Abide by a curfew by remaining within your\nplace of residence at all times except for the purposes of employment or except\nwith the prior written permission of your Conditional Sentence Supervisor, such\npermission to be carried on your person.You must present yourself at the door\nor answer the telephone during reasonable hours for curfew checks; failure to\ndo so will be a presumptive breach of this condition;You know from the past few months that\nthey will be checking.7.You are also to abstain absolutely from the possession or\nconsumption of alcohol and controlled drugs or substances except in accordance\nwith a prescription given to you by a qualified medical practitioner.You are\nto provide a sample of your breath or urine for the purposes of analysis upon\ndemand by a peace officer who has reason to believe that you may have failed to\ncomply with this condition;[12]Mr. Coffin, any issues with providing a sample\nif there are reasonable grounds?[13]MR. COFFIN:No.[14]THE COURT:I recognize\nthat you were not under the influence with respect to this offence but it is\nclear to me your risk factors go way up if you are.So I am satisfied you do\nneed to continue to abstain.8.You are not to attend any bar, tavern, liquor store, off-sales\nor other commercial premises whose primary purpose is the sale of alcohol;9.You are to take such alcohol and/or drug assessment,\ncounselling or programming as directed by your Supervisor.Attend and complete\na residential treatment program if so directed by your Supervisor;10.You are to report to Offender Services to be assessed, and\nattend and complete any recommended programming as directed by your Supervisor;11.Take such other assessment, counselling and programming as\ndirected by your Supervisor;12.You are to have no contact directly or indirectly or\ncommunication in any way with A.L., except with the prior written permission of\nyour Supervisor in consultation with Victim Services and Family and Children\nServices;That is not so\nthat you cannot have contact, it is so that contact can be monitored.I just\nwant the Supervisor to have a handle on how things are going in terms of when\nand how you should have contact.So I am not putting that there to suggest\nthat you do not have any contact, just so that it be monitored and somebody is\nkeeping an eye on things.13.You are to have no contact directly or communication in\nany way with P.S.;Having had the\ndiscussion with respect to restitution, I am going to decline to make the order\nbecause that appears to have been resolved through other means.14.You are to participate in such educational or life skills\nprogramming as directed by your Supervisor;15.Make reasonable efforts to find and maintain suitable\nemployment and provide your Supervisor with all necessary details concerning\nyour efforts;16.You are to provide your Supervisor with consents to\nrelease information with regard to your participation in any programming,\ncounselling, employment or educational activities that you have been directed\nto do pursuant to this conditional sentence order.[15]I have a question with respect to the last\nsuggested condition, that being, essentially, the weapons condition.Would\nthis not be a mandatory offence for the purposes of s. 109?[16]THE ACCUSED:I’ve already got a\nten year.[17]THE COURT:There is already one?[18]THE ACCUSED:Yeah.[19]MR. GOUAILLIER:And I think\nyou’re right, Your --[20]THE COURT:In which case, you may be\nlooking at a lifetime ban.[21]MR. COFFIN:Yeah, that’s fine.[22]THE COURT:Okay.I think pursuant\nto s. 109, that is a requirement for this offence, and because you have a\nprior, it is going to be a lifetime ban.So in addition to the conditional\nsentence, there will be a lifetime prohibition pursuant tos. 109 that you not have in your possession any firearms, ammunition or\nexplosive substances.[23]Any concerns on the conditional sentence\nconditions?[24]MR. GOUAILLIER:Yes, I have one\nthing, and, again, it’s not something I’ve discussed with A.L..On this\nmonitored contact, I wonder if there’s a requirement - it’s in the interim\nrelease conditions - for monitored access to her residence.There is a not\nattend.So whether there’s any need for a not attend unless you have\npermission from the -- and I don’t know, perhaps that’s something A.L. may --[25]THE COURT: In this case, I think I am satisfied,\nbased on the information in the report, that so long as the Supervisor is clued\ninto what is going on and how both of them are doing, in allowing them to have\ncontact, I think that is sufficient in these circumstances.Mr. Coffin, any\nconcerns about the conditional sentence conditions?[26]MR. COFFIN:No.[27]THE COURT:Okay.So the\nconditional sentence is to be followed by a probationary term of two years\nwhich will be on the following terms and conditions:1.That you keep the peace and be of good behaviour;2.Appear before the Court when required to do so by the\nCourt;3.Notify your Probation Officer in advance of any change of\nname or address and promptly notify the Probation Officer of any change of\nemployment or occupation;4.Report to a Probation Officer immediately upon completion\nof your conditional sentence and thereafter when and in the manner directed by\nthe Probation Officer;5.I am going to require that you abstain absolutely again,\nbecause of the risk factors, from the possession or consumption of alcohol and\ncontrolled drugs or substances except in accordance with a prescription given\nto you by a qualified medical practitioner;6.You are not to attend any bar, tavern, off-sales or other\ncommercial premises whose primary purpose is the sale of alcohol;7.You are to take such alcohol and drug assessment,\ncounselling or programming as directed by your Probation Officer;8.You are to report to Offender Services to be assessed,\nand attend and complete any recommended programming as directed by your\nSupervisor;9.Take such other assessment, counselling and programming\nas directed by your Supervisor;I am not going\nto include the no contact with A.L., with respect to the probationary term.I\nexpect by the time you get to that, any other issues will have been long\nresolved.However, I will include it with respect to P.S..10.Have no contact directly or indirectly or communication in\nany way with P.S.;11.Participate in such educational or life skills programming\nas directed by your Supervisor;12.Make reasonable efforts to find and maintain suitable\nemployment and provide your Supervisor with all necessary details concerning\nyour efforts;13.Provide your Supervisor with consents to release\ninformation with regard to your participation in any programming, counselling,\nemployment or educational activities you have been directed to do pursuant to\nthis probation order.[28]So it is primarily just the programming on your\nprobationary term, to continue what it is that you have already started working\non.You are working right now, though?[29]THE ACCUSED:Yeah.[30]THE COURT:Okay.There is going to\nbe a victim fine surcharge, then.I believe with the summary election it would\nbe $50.[31]MR. GOUAILLIER:Yes.[32]THE COURT:How long does he need to\npay that?[33]THE ACCUSED:Two weeks?[34]MR. COFFIN:Two weeks.[35]THE COURT:Okay.Two weeks time to\npay.[36]MR. GOUAILLIER:And this is also\na primary designated offence.[37]THE COURT:For DNA?[38]MR. GOUAILLIER:For DNA.[39]THE COURT:Okay.Then I will make\nthe order.Mr. Coffin, any submissions?[40]MR. COFFIN:No.[41]THE COURT:Then I will make the\norder that you provide such samples of your blood as are necessary for DNA\ntesting and banking.[42]The remaining counts?[43]MR. GOUAILLIER:It would be a\nstay of proceedings, Your Honour.[44]THE COURT:Okay.________________________________RUDDY\nC.J.T.C."}

FUERSTon October 15, 2010, at NEWMARKET, Ontario**********CHARGES:Possession of a Prohibited Device (x2)Possession of a Prohibited Device while ProhibitedSmuggling**********APPEARANCES:L. SaundersCounsel for the Provincial CrownN. PeelCounsel for Gordon\nYatesREASONS FOR SENTENCEFUERST,\nJ. (Orally):[1]Gordon Yates pleaded guilty to two\ncounts of possession of a prohibited device, specified respectively as a large\ncapacity cartridge magazine and a handgun barrel less than 105 millimetres in length, knowing that he was not the\nholder of a licence to possess that device; one count of possession of those\ntwo prohibited devices while he was bound by a firearms prohibition order; and\none count of smuggling firearms parts into Canada from Florida contrary to the Customs\nAct.The Circumstances of the Offences[2]In 2003 Mr. Yates moved to Canada from the United States, where he had lived for many years.He\nbrought with him a number of firearms.[3]In 2004 Mr Yates was charged\nwith several firearms offences.The charges were withdrawn when he agreed to\nand did enter into a firearms prohibition order on March 14, 2005.The order\nwas for a period of four years.[4]On October 31, 2007,\nCanadian Border Services Agency (“CBSA”) officers intercepted a package mailed\nto Mr. Yates from the UnitedStates.Its\ncontents were described as a “gun frame”.The package was put back into the\nmail for delivery.Mr. Yates picked up the package on November 6, 2007.[5]In mid-June 2008 CBSA\nofficers intercepted another package mailed to Mr. Yates from the United States.It contained two pistol slides\ncompatible with a Colt model 1911 type handgun.An investigation of Mr. Yates\ncommenced.[6]On October 14, 2008, CBSA\nofficers intercepted a third package that was mailed to Mr. Yates from the United States.Its contents were described as\n“machined upper parts” with a value of $75.They were parts for a Colt model\n1911 type handgun.Only the frames were missing.[7]From the parts in the third\npackage, OPP Senior Gunsmith Stuart Seki was able to build two complete slide\nassemblies for a Colt model 1911 type handgun.He took two rounds of 45 ACP\nammunition, removed the propellant and projectile from each, and was able to\nchamber and discharge the primers in each assembly using a common hand tool to\nstrike the firing pin.Each slide assembly met the Criminal Code\ndefinition of a “firearm”.Using a stripped Colt model 1911 type handgun frame\nthat was not part of the package, Mr. Seki was able to build a complete firearm\nin six to seven minutes.He had enough parts left over to build a second\ncomplete firearm.[8]The police executed a search\nwarrant at Mr. Yates’ home on November 7, 2008.They seized 10 frames, 17 slide\nassemblies, 6 lower receivers, 3 upper receivers, 20 handgun magazines, and 5\nrifle magazines.[9]The police also seized two\nprohibited devices.The first, a large capacity magazine was found on a\nworkbench in the garage.It appeared to be compatible with a Colt model AR-15\nassault rifle.It had the capacity to hold 30 rounds of .223 calibre\nammunition.The second prohibited device was found in a package inside Mr.\nYates’ bedroom closet.The package, which had been sent from the United States, contained a handgun slide\nassembly having a .45 calibre short barrel less than 105 millimetres in length.[10]The prohibited devices were\ncovered by the prohibition order that was still in existence.Further, Mr.\nYates was not licensed to possess firearms.[11]Mr. Yates was cooperative\nwith the police on his arrest.He told them that the October 14, 2008, package\nhad been sent to him by his ex-wife, and that on his instructions she labelled\nit as containing “machined upper parts” with a value of $75.His involvement\nin the purposeful failure to properly identify the items constitutes smuggling\nunder the Canada Customs Act.The Circumstances of Mr. Yates.[12]Mr. Yates is 45 years old.He has no prior criminal record.He is the father of four children with his\nex-wife.He is in a common law relationship with the woman he plans to marry,\nwho also has children.Two teenaged children and a young grandson live with\nthem.His fiancée reports that he is a devoted parent and grandparent.[13]Mr. Yates has a grade 10\neducation.He lived in the UnitedStates for about 15\nyears, where he operated a flooring company and also worked for a short period\nas a private investigator.He has his own flooring business at which he works\nlong hours.He employs one of his sons.He is the sole financial support of\nhis family.[14]Mr. Yates is a volunteer\nfire fighter with the Severn Township Fire Department.He was recently\npromoted to captain, and put in charge of a shift of five other individuals.He is described as reliable, with good common sense and sound judgement.He\nalso participates in various charitable fundraising activities in the\ncommunity.[15]Mr. Yates remained out of\ncustody following his arrest.Although the conditions of his release did not\ninclude onerous terms such as house arrest, there is no suggestion that he did\nnot abide by them.[16]The pre-sentence reporter\ndescribes Mr. Yates as demonstrating strong family ties, and having strong ties\nto his employment and his community.She concluded that he recognizes the\nseriousness of his offences, accepts full responsibility for his actions, and\ndemonstrates a willingness to make amends.The Positions of the Parties[17]On behalf of the Crown, Ms.\nSaunders seeks a jail term of four months on each count, all concurrent, a\nfirearms prohibition order for 10 years, and forfeiture of the items seized.She emphasizes that Mr. Yates breached a court-imposed firearms prohibition\norder by possessing an over-capacity magazine and a short handgun barrel, for\nwhich even a gun collector would have no need.She points out that he\nobviously was assembling firearms parts at his house, which was occupied by\nteenaged children and a grandchild, and that those parts could have been stolen\nhad his home been broken into.It is obvious that his keen interest in\nfirearms has continued notwithstanding the imposition of a prohibition order.This is of concern, given the prevalence of firearms-related crimes in the\ncommunity.Ms. Saunders submits that a suspended sentence and probation would\nfail to address the needs of deterrence.[18]On behalf of the defence,\nMr. Peel reminds me that Mr. Yates has no previous criminal record.Mr. Yates\nknew that he was bound by a prohibition order and that he was not licensed to\npossess any of the items.He did not intend to assemble them, however, until\nthe prohibition order expired and he had a licence.He thought that he could\nkeep them in the meantime.Some of the items had to be machined.Mr. Peel\nsuggests it is unlikely that anyone without expertise with firearms could put\nthe parts together, and he emphasizes that no powder or bullets were found at\nthe house such that there was a danger to the children or grandchild in the\nhome.Mr. Yates was cooperative with the police and arranged for them to pick\nup another package that was en route at the point of his arrest.He is the\nsole support of his family, and he contributes to his community as a volunteer\nfirefighter.He can comply with court orders.Mr. Peel seeks a suspended\nsentence and probation, with a term that Mr. Yates perform 200 hours of\ncommunity service work with the fire department.He agrees that there must be\na firearms prohibition order.He asks that the forfeiture order not take\neffect for three months so that Mr. Yates can transfer the parts to an FAC\nholder, because they have value.The Principles of Sentencing[19]The objectives of sentencing\nlong recognized at common law have been codified in Section 718 of the Criminal\nCode.They are: the denunciation of unlawful conduct, deterrence both\ngeneral and specific, the separation of the offender from society where\nnecessary, rehabilitation, reparation for harm done to the victims or the\ncommunity, and promotion of a sense of responsibility in offenders and\nacknowledgement of the harm done.[20]Section 718.1 provides that\na sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree\nof responsibility of the offender.Section 718.2 provides that a sentence\nshould be increased or decreased to account for any aggravating and mitigating\ncircumstances.It sets out various aggravating factors, none of which apply in\nthis case.It also requires that a sentence be similar to those imposed on\nsimilar offenders in similar circumstances, that the combined duration of\nconsecutive sentences not be unduly long, that an offender not be deprived of\nliberty if less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate, and that all\navailable sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances\nbe considered.Aggravating and Mitigating Factors in this\nCase[21]The aggravating factors are\nthat:1.Mr. Yates possessed not\njust one but twoprohibited devices;2.One of the prohibited\ndevices was notsimply stored at his home, but was on\naworkbench in the garage;3.He also possessed an extensive number offirearms parts.If not for his arrest,he would have had\nthe parts necessary toassemble at least\ntwo complete firearms;4.He possessed the\nprohibited devices aswell as the parts knowing\nthat he wasbound by a firearms prohibition order,to which he had consented;5.He possessed the\nprohibited devices aswell as the parts\nknowing that he wasnot licensed to possess\nthe firearms;6.Neither the prohibited\ndevices nor thefirearms parts found in\nhis home weresecured in any way.They could havebeen stolen in the event\nof a break-inand distributed for\nillicit use.[22]In mitigation I consider\nthat:1.Mr. Yates has no prior\ncriminal record;2.He was cooperative with\nthe police;3.He pleaded guilty, which is anexpression of remorse and\nwillingness toaccept responsibility for his\nactions;4.He is a hard-working\nindividual whoprovides for his family;5.He has strong family\nties and enjoys asupportive relationship\nwith hisfiancée;6.He contributes to his\ncommunity as avolunteer firefighter\nand throughcharitable activities.Analysis[23]It is apparent that Mr.\nYates has a long-standing fascination with firearms.While that in and of\nitself is not an offence, I agree with Ms. Saunders that it is a consideration\nin determining the nature of the sentence that will deter him, as well as other\nlike-minded individuals, from acquiring and possessing firearms and related\nitems while prohibited from doing so, and/or without the requisite licence.[24]It must be made clear to Mr.\nYates and to others that the firearms provisions of the Criminal Code\nand court orders imposed pursuant to them are not mere guidelines to be ignored\nat will.They apply notwithstanding the legitimacy of an owner’s interest in\nfirearms.This is a particularly important message to send in the interest of\nprotection of the public.[25]I have given serious\nconsideration to imposing a jail sentence as suggested by Ms. Saunders.I\nwould have no hesitation in imposing a jail sentence if Mr. Yates were a repeat\noffender, a participant in an organized firearms importation scheme, or the\nsubject of a negative pre-sentence report.He is none of these.Moreover, because\nhe is before me as a first offender with positive employment, family and\ncommunity ties, I must have regard to his rehabilitative prospects.These\nwould not be advanced by a custodial sentence.[26]Notwithstanding that Mr.\nYates breached a court-imposed order, he was cooperative with the police and\nhas abided by the conditions of his release while awaiting disposition of the\ncharges.I am satisfied that he now understands the necessity of abiding by\ncourt orders and that he would obey conditions of probation if he were\npermitted to remain out of custody.I am satisfied that a non-custodial\nsentence would meet the needs of general and specific deterrence, while\nencouraging his rehabilitation and underscoring his sense of responsibility for\nhis offences.[27]Mr. Yates please stand.I\nsentence you on count 7 to a suspended sentence and a period of probation of 18\nmonths.For the entire 18 months you will be bound by the statutory conditions\nof probation, and in addition the following

RUSONIK [Counsel for the respondent]:Just a second.

HeroldDated the\n17th day of June, 2015(Docket:\n12-12-33, 08-13-147, and 12-13-20)MEMORANDUM OF JUDGMENT(NOTE:This document may have been edited for\npublication)I.\nOVERVIEW[1]The appellant was\nsent to prison following a finding that she had breached a Conditional\nSentence Order [CSO], and was not given credit for the time during which\nthe CSO was suspended.[2]The sentencing\njudge’s decision to remit the appellant to prison upon her breach of a CSO\nwarrants appellate intervention; further, the appellant ought to have been\ngranted some credit for the period of time during which the conditional\nsentence order was suspended.II.\nINTRODUCTION[3]The\nappellant appeals the sentencing judge’s decision to terminate her 18-month CSO\nand commit her to custody for the remaining five months. She submits that the\nsentencing judge erred in refusing her application to adjourn the CSO breach\nhearing and further erred in law by:1.failing to\ngive meaningful or any consideration to any other sentencing option for breach\nof a CSO as set out in the Criminal Code of Canada, RSC 1985, c C-46 [Criminal\nCode], s 742.6(9) other than collapsing the order;2.failing to\nallow Defence Counsel any opportunity to make sentencing submissions concerning\nher personal circumstances and relevant Gladue[1] factors; and3.failing to\nconsider the factors listed in Criminal Code s 742.6(17) before denying\nany credit for the period of time during which the CSO was suspended - 3 months\nand 17 days.[4]Appellant’s Counsel\nconfined oral argument to the latter three grounds but did not abandon the\ncomplaint of refusing an adjournment.[5]This\nappeal is allowed. The appellant is granted 50 days’ credit for the 50 days remaining\nto be served under the CSO; consequently, the appellant has served her entire\nconditional sentence order.III.\nBACKGROUND[6]On\nJanuary 21, 2014, the appellant was initially sentenced to an 18-month CSO for\noffences of uttering threats and two counts of breaching an undertaking by\nconsuming alcohol. On February 28, 2015, the Crown alleged that she violated\nthe CSO by failing to keep the peace and be of good behaviour, upon being\ncharged with another uttering threats offence. The threats consisted of phone\ncalls made to a hotel in Resolute Bay where a witness alleged that the\nappellant made two statements to the effect: “if I do not hear from my husband,\nI will come with a rifle and shoot up my way in and shoot at the police to get\nmy kids back.” On March 1, 2015, the appellant was granted bail on the CSO\nbreach allegation and the uttering threats offence. Accordingly, prior to the\nbreach allegation, the appellant had successfully completed more than 13 months\nof her CSO, including 12 months of stringent conditions, including house\narrest.[7]June\n17, 2015, was the next regular circuit date in Resolute Bay. This date was the\nappellant’s first appearance on the CSO breach allegation.[8]The\nappellant sought to adjourn the CSO breach hearing for a further four months –\nto a date upon which the uttering threats charge could be set down for trial.\nThe Crown opposed the adjournment, submitting that under s 742.6(3)(a) of the Criminal\nCode, a breach hearing must commence within 30 days of the date\nof the offender’s arrest, or as soon as practicable thereafter. Because more\nthan three months had already passed since the appellant’s arrest, it was not\nreasonable to further delay the CSO breach hearing.[9]The\nadjournment request was refused, the Court expressing dismay that bail had been\ngranted, and finding that a seven-month delay was not an adjournment for a\n“reasonable period” under s 742.6(3.3) of the Criminal Code.[10]The\nCrown submitted that the CSO should be collapsed. The appellant did not\nchallenge the evidence, but through Defence Counsel, she submitted that the\nultimate issue at trial on the uttering threats offence would be whether\ncriminal intent could be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, in light of her\nintoxication at the time of the offence.[11]On\nthe requisite balance of probabilities, the presiding judge then found that the\nappellant had breached the CSO conditions. Without the benefit of further\nsubmissions, the presiding judge then decided that “[the appellant] is now\ngoing to have to return to custody to finish the conditional sentence. I see no\nother option.”[12]Defence\nCounsel nonetheless sought credit for the time during which the appellant had\nto wait for the Resolute Bay regular circuit date; urging the Court to\n“tighten” the conditions of the CSO, rather than collapse the entire order.\nTwice Defence Counsel attempted to provide details about the appellant’s\npersonal circumstances; twice the hearing judge denied Defence Counsel\npermission to make those submissions. Relying upon his stated assumption that Gladue\nfactors had been considered when the original CSO was imposed, the presiding\njudge reiterated that he saw no other option, but to remit the appellant to\ncustody to finish the CSO.[13]On\nAugust 15, 2015, the appellant was released on bail pending appeal. Thus,\nbetween sentencing on June 17, 2015, and her interim release pending appeal on\nAugust 15, 2015, the appellant served 60 days in custody and earned 30 days of\nremission, for a total of 90 days served of the 140 days left on the CSO\n(Appellate Counsel for the appellant noted that the Crown had only initially\nasked for 105 days for the triggering offences). There are 50 days left to be\nserved under the CSO.[14]The\nCrown respondent conceded that the sentencing judge erred in failing to\nconsider any of the enumerated sentencing options under Criminal Code s\n742.6(9), other than terminating the appellant’s CSO, and also erred in denying\nDefence Counsel the opportunity to make sentencing submissions. At the hearing\nof this appeal, the respondent further conceded that the sentencing judge\nshould have specifically considered Gladue factors at the CSO breach\nhearing. Notwithstanding these concessions, the Crown submitted that collapsing\nthe entire CSO was a fit sentence, and that no error was made in refusing the\nadjournment or denying any credit for the time period during which the CSO was\nsuspended.IV.\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW[15]Appellate\nintervention in a sentence decision is warranted where there has been a clear\nerror of principle, a failure to properly consider, or an over-emphasis of, a\nrelevant factor, or where the sentence imposed is demonstrably unfit (R v\nM(CA), 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] 1 SCR 500 at paras 89-90, 105 CCC (3d) 327; R v LM,\n2008 SCC 31 (CanLII) at para 14, [2008] 2 SCR 163).V. ANALYSIS[16]The\nhearing judge committed four errors:1) failing to consider any enumerated option under Criminal\nCode s 742.6(9), other than terminating the CSO;2) failing to permit Defence Counsel to make sentencing\nsubmissions;3) failing to consider Gladue factors relevant to\na fit sentence; and4) failing to grant any credit for the period of time\nduring which the appellant’s CSO was suspended pre-hearing.[17]These\nerrors allow this Court to consider this matter anew and resentence the\nappellant to a fit and proper sentence in consideration of all the relevant facts\nand sentencing principles. There was no error in refusing the adjournment.A.\nRefusing the adjournment request[18]A\ntrial judge has discretion to grant or refuse an adjournment, reviewable on\nappeal only to determine whether the decision was “well-founded in law” (Barrette\nv The Queen, 1976 CanLII 180 (SCC), [1977] 2 SCR 121 at 125, 68 DLR (3d) 260). Under the\nconditional sentence regime of the Criminal Code, a breach hearing is to\ncommence within 30 days following the offender’s arrest or as soon thereafter\nas practicable (Criminal Code s 742.6(3)). This timing is subject to a\ncourt’s discretion to grant adjournments “for a reasonable period” (Criminal\nCode s 742.6(3.3)). Until a determination is made as to whether or not a\nbreach has occurred, the offender’s CSO is suspended (Criminal Code s\n742.6(10)).[19]R\nv McIvor,\n2008 SCC 11 (CanLII) at para 18, [2008] 1 SCR 285, confirmed Parliament’s intention\nthat allegations of CSO violations are to be dealt with in a simplified and\nexpedited process.[20]The\nhearing judge did not err in refusing to grant an adjournment - a delay of\nseven months is not a “reasonable period”.[21]The\nfour errors can be dealt with under two main headings.(i).\nTerminating the CSO and committal to custody[22]The\nhearing judge was required to consider all of the options set out in Criminal\nCode s 742.6(9). Upon finding a CSO breach, a judge can:(a)take no action;(b)change the optional conditions;(c)suspend the conditional sentence order and direct(i)that the offender serve in custody\na portion of the unexpired sentence, and(ii)that the conditional sentence\norder resume on the offender’s release from custody, either with or without\nchanges to the optional conditions; or(d) terminate the conditional sentence\norder and direct that the offender be committed to custody until the expiration\nof the sentence.[23]In\nR v Proulx, 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII) at para 39, [2000] 1 SCR 61, Chief Justice Lamer\nsaid that where an offender breaches a CSO condition without a reasonable\nexcuse, “there should be a presumption that the offender serve the remainder in\njail.” There is some debate in the jurisprudence as to whether these comments\nwere obiter dicta.[24]For\nexample, in R v Weir, 2000 ABPC 62 (CanLII) at paras 12-13, 263\nAR 365 [Weir], Fradsham PCJ says:. .\n. I do not read R. v. Proulx, supra, as directing that any\nbreach of a conditional sentence must result in the offender serving the rest\nof his or her sentence in custody. I say this for a number of reasons:(1)\nsuch a pronouncement would, in effect, repeal subsections (a), (b), and (c) of section 742.6(9) of\nthe Criminal Code;(2)\nthe Supreme Court of Canada spoke in terms of “a presumption” which indicates\nthat such a result is not inevitable [which is more in keeping with the content\nof section 742.6(9)];(3)\nrequiring an offender to serve the remaining portion of his or her sentence in\ncustody is the maximum punishment possible (see: R. v. Proulx,\nsupra, at p. 469), and it is illogical to conclude that all offenders\nshould have imposed on them the maximum punishment permitted;(4)\nsuch an interpretation could result in a sentence being imposed which failed to\ncomply with the purpose, objectives, and principles of sentencing set forth in sections 718 to718.2 of the Criminal Code.[25]In\nmy view, if termination of the CSO complies with relevant sentencing principles\nit should be made; if not, then other options under Criminal Code s\n742.6(9) must be considered.[26]R\nv Langley (TE), 2005 BCCA 478 (CanLII) at para 13, 216 BCAC 311, sets out\nvarious factors a court ought to consider in determining whether the\npresumption of termination should be applied in an individual case. These\ninclude:. .\n. the nature of the offence; the nature, circumstances, and timing of the\nbreach; any subsequent criminal conduct and sentences for that conduct; changes\nin the plan for community supervision; the effect of termination on the\nappropriateness of the sentence for the original offence; and the offender’s\nprevious criminal record . . . the list of factors [is not] closed (See also R\nv Beaulieu, 2015 MBCA 90 (CanLII) at para 20, 125 WCB (2d) 667 [Beaulieu]).[27]Another\nimportant consideration is the length and nature of the conditional sentence,\nin comparison to that which would have been appropriate had the sentence for\nthe original offence been custodial (R v Talman, 2005 BCCA 279 (CanLII) at\npara 10, 213 BCAC 43; Weir, at para 18). Where a conditional\nsentence may be lengthier than a conventional jail sentence for a particular\noffence, an accused on a breach becomes vulnerable to serving more time in jail\nthan would have been served for the original offence had custody been imposed\nin the first instance. Here, the Crown originally sought 105 days in custody\nfor the original offences for which the CSO was imposed. In my view, this is a\nrelevant consideration, together with time served, in assessing the options for\nbreaching the CSO.[28]Nothing\non the record suggests that the hearing judge considered any option but to\nterminate the CSO and commit the appellant to custody to serve out the\nremainder of the CSO. This is an error, compounded by failing to permit Defence\nCounsel to make sentencing submissions on the appellant’s background and\ncircumstances.(ii).\nMatters relevant to sentencing[29]Sections\n723, 726, and 726.1 of the Criminal Code provide that a court shall,\nprior to imposing sentence, ask whether an offender has anything to say, give\nboth sides an opportunity to make submissions on relevant facts, and consider\nany relevant information placed before it, including the representations made\nby or on behalf of the prosecution or the offender. The record reveals that\nthese statutory obligations were not respected.[30]Counsel\nshould be afforded sufficient, and reasonable, latitude to make submissions\nrelevant to their client’s circumstances, as those may bear upon sentence. A\nsentencing court ought to avoid the appearance of impatience about the content\nor quality of counsel submissions, and ought to avoid conveying a\ndisinclination to allow counsel to be heard: “this strike[s] at the core of\nfundamental fairness in the sentencing process” (MacFarlane v R, 2014\nNBCA 35 (CanLII) at para 25, 114 WCB (2d) 585; R\nv Irvine, 2010 ABCA 212 (CanLII) at para 10, 88 WCB (2d) 721).[31]Further,\nthe record reflects no meaningful consideration of s 718.2(e) of the Criminal\nCode or the general or particular circumstances of the appellant’s\naboriginal heritage. R v Ipeelee, 2012 SCC 13 (CanLII) at paras 81-86,\n[2012] 1 SCR 433, makes clear that there is no discretion as to whether such\nfactors are to be assessed on sentencing. The principles established in Gladue\nmust be considered in every case involving an aboriginal offender. The\nappellant did not waive this requirement, nor did the sentencing court satisfy\nits duty by assuming that Gladue factors had been assessed at the\nimposition of the CSO.[32]The\nAddendum to the appellant’s factum makes plain that Gladue factors\nwere a critical consideration that bore upon any sentencing decision in this\nmatter.[33]Briefly,\nthe appellant is now in her mid-40s, born and raised in Resolute Bay. After\nbeing sexually abused at school while a young child, she was fearful of school\nand ultimately quit in grade six. Sexual assaults also occurred in adulthood.\nShe was also involved in abusive domestic relationships. She struggles with\nalcohol addiction and drug abuse, and has serious health issues including\narthritis, depression, and a personality disorder. In addition, she suffered a\ntraumatic brain injury in a car crash. She has been hospitalized for various\nmental health issues, including instances of attempted suicide.[34]The\nappellant and her husband have five children and three grandchildren – the\nthree youngest children (ages 15, 10 and 4) live at home. The threats in breach\nof the CSO began as a domestic dispute in which the appellant was drunk, her\nhusband became angry and punched her in the face. He was not charged, but\nremoved from the home, with the children, to the local hotel. When her phone\ncalls to the hotel were not put through to her husband, she eventually uttered\nthe threats, fearful for her children’s well-being.[35]Despite\nthis background, the appellant has made substantial and sustained personal\nefforts to avail herself of all available addiction and mental health\nrehabilitation in Resolute Bay, a small northern community which is vastly\nunder-resourced in this regard. She runs a successful small business at the\nlocal airport, but the needs of her children and her work are barriers to her\nability to travel to other communities to seek additional treatment and\ncounselling.[36]It may be\nhelpful to compare this case to the (unrelated) case of R v McDonald,\n2015 ABCA 108 (CanLII) at para 27, 599 AR 300, dealing with an offender’s efforts at\nrehabilitation through a drug court system; the offender failed by\nre-offending. The Court there noted that “[t]he objective of rehabilitation still\nremains even where an offender’s lengthy criminal history, coupled with a\ndurable addiction, means the hope of effective rehabilitation may be fading . .\n. .” In that case, the Crown had proposed that the entire potential sentence\nwhich had been shelved when the offender entered the drug court program should\nbe imposed by reason of failure well into the process. At para 45 the Court\nadded, in relation to breaching offenders, that: “[b]y signaling that society\nwill not simply write them off because of a lack of success this time around,\nit reinforces in offenders the ultimate goals of the program.”[37]Here\nthe sentencing judge opined that there was no alternative to collapsing the\norder. That is not necessarily so. In my view, had the foregoing factors\nbeen properly considered by the sentencing court, it would not have inevitably\nled to the conclusion that the only available option was terminating the CSO\nand committal to custody. The decision of the sentencing judge to terminate the\norder was therefore not reasonable.[38]Finally,\nin assessing whether any of the period of suspension between February 28 and\nJune 17, 2015, should have been credited as time served under the CSO, the\nsentencing judge failed to refer to or consider any of the factors specifically\nset out in the legislation when such a determination is made (Criminal Code\nss 742.6(16) and 742.6(17)). A sentencing court retains the discretionary power\nto apportion some or all of the suspended time back to the offender’s credit on\nthe CSO, if it is determined that there are “exceptional” circumstances and it\nis “in the interests of justice.” As with any discretionary power, it must be\nexercised judiciously and in keeping within the parameters of the law.[39]The\nfactors which must be considered in determining whether to exercise discretion\nto grant credit are set out in Criminal Code s 742.6(17), as follows:(a)the circumstances\nand seriousness of the breach;(b)whether not\nmaking the order would cause the offender undue hardship based on the\noffender’s personal circumstances; and(c)the\nperiod for which the offender was subject to conditions while running of the\nconditional sentence order was suspended and whether the offender complied with\nthose conditions during that period.[40]While\nsome of the circumstances of the breach were before the sentencing judge, and\nDefence Counsel was able to provide particulars as to the appellant’s strict\ncompliance with the terms of the CSO during the suspension, the sentencing\njudge erroneously disallowed all submissions relevant to the issue of “undue\nhardship based on the offender’s personal circumstances.” Again, these\ncircumstances would undoubtedly have entailed Gladue considerations.[41]Moreover,\nthe record and the Addendum to the appellant’s factum indicate a\nsignificant collateral consequence to fully collapsing the appellant’s CSO and\nordering her into custody. That is, her resulting separation from her three\nyoung children while in custody and uncertainty associated with their care.\nDefence Counsel submitted that the substitute caregiver, the grandmother, may\nnot have the stamina to handle all three children. The Addendum includes\nconfirmation by the local social worker that the appellant’s children “were\ndevastated” and their mood change was noticeable while the appellant was\nincarcerated following the termination of her CSO.[42]A\nsentencing court may take into account collateral consequences of a sentence\n“as personal circumstances of the offender” and adjust the sentence\naccordingly, in keeping with the principles of proportionality and\nindividualization (R v Pham, 2013 SCC 15 (CanLII) at paras 11-14, [2013] 1 SCR\n739 [Pham]).[43]I\necho R v Stanberry, 2015 QCCQ 1097 (CanLII) at paras 16-26, 18\nCR (7th) 87, where the Court found that it was incumbent on the sentencing\njudge to consider whether the separation of the appellant from her children “…will\nentail what can only be described today as incalculable adverse effects both\nfor the offender and her children. They are properly regarded, as the Court\nsaid in Pham, as “personal circumstances of the offender” (para 20)”.[44]In\nlight of the Addendum information put before this Court, it appears that\nthe adverse effects upon the children of a custodial sentence may have\nmagnified the severity of the sentence imposed here. Not every circumstance, of\ncourse, will warrant an adjustment in sentence. Nonetheless, the sentencing\njudge ought to have allowed submissions, and considered this aspect. There is\nno legal principle of which I am aware that would preclude such consideration.[45]The\nappellant waited three months and 17 days for her CSO breach hearing; delay\nthat was neither the fault of, nor consented to by, the appellant. Rather, the\ndelay was institutional or systemic in nature, sufficient to constitute an\n“exceptional case” (R v Bright, 2009 ABCA 56 (CanLII) at para 11, 448 AR 387, Beaulieu,\nat paras 43-59). It seems that if more than three months’ delay to the first\nhearing date provided a basis for denying the appellant’s adjournment\napplication, perhaps it ought equally to have been considered a relevant basis\nupon which to grant credit to the appellant. This balancing was not considered.[46]Very\nrecently, R v Webster, 2016 ABCA 140 (CanLII) at para 6, [2016] AJ No 481\n(QL), said that there must be a “principled reason to deny credit” for a period\nof institutional delay. Nothing in the record provides any reason as to why\ncredit should not be granted.[47]The\ninterests of justice warrant granting some credit for the period of suspension\nin this case, particularly where the appellant was fully compliant with the\nconditions of the CSO during that period. While failing to keep the peace and\nbe of good behaviour by being charged with uttering a threat is serious\nconduct, as was admitted by the appellant, such conduct must be balanced\nagainst any undue hardship to the appellant and the fact that she abided by the\nconditions of the CSO and her bail conditions during the period of suspension,\nand that the period of suspension was lengthy.VI.\nCONCLUSION[48]For\nthe reasons given, this appeal is allowed. Fifty days remain left to be served\nby the appellant under the CSO. The appellant shall receive credit for those 50\ndays, as time served when the appellant’s CSO was suspended prior to the breach\nhearing. Accordingly, the appellant has completed her CSO and has served her\nentire sentence.Appeal\nheard on May\n9, 2016Memorandum\nfiled at Iqaluit, NunavutThis\n31st day of May, 2016______________________Schutz\nJ.A.Appearances:B.

Hawke of the Ontario Court of Justice.O’Connor J.\n(ad hoc):[1]The\nappellant, Nicholas Prioriello, appeals his sentences on 32 convictions to\nwhich he pled guilty.Facts[2]The\ntotal length of the sentences was just short of 8 years in prison.He was\ngiven credit for pre-trial custody of nearly 2 years, leaving 6 years\napportioned as follows:•Five years for each of the following offences,\nall to be served concurrently:•Possession of property obtained by crime over\n$5,000 (x2)•Failure to stop for a police officer•Dangerous driving•Impaired driving•Drive while disqualified•Breach of probation (x4)•One year for each of the following offences to\nbe served, concurrently to one another, but consecutively to the above charges:•Break and enter and commit theft (non-dwelling\nhouse) (x19)•Possession of burglary tools (x3)[3]The\noffences occurred between October 17, 2008 and January 24, 2009.He broke into\n24 commercial properties in Halton, Toronto, Peel and Durham.In excess of\n$55,000 was stolen and approximately $12,000 in damages caused.As part of his\nplea bargain arrangement, no convictions were registered on other counts.On\nJanuary 23, 2009, he stole a van, drank a large quantity of alcohol and led\npolice on a high speed chase on residential and commercial streets in West\nToronto.During the chase, he drove into a police cruiser, causing an officer\nminor injuries and twice collided with snow banks.When the van broke down, he\nfled on foot.While being arrested he fought with police, resulting in an\nofficer breaking his hand.[4]The\nappellant has a lengthy criminal record, including over 120 previous\nconvictions.At the time of his arrest, he was banned for life from driving\nand was subject to two probation orders.[5]The\nCrown sought a total sentence of 5 to 6 years on the first group of offences\nand a consecutive 3 to 5 years on the second group, less the 2 year credit for\npre-trial custody.The Crown’s range was therefore 8-11 years, less 2 years or\n6 to 9 years.[6]The\ndefence argued for a net upper reformatory sentence for all offences.As\nnoted, the sentencing judge imposed a total sentence between those suggested by\nthe two counsel.[7]The\nappellant argues the sentencing judge erred in arriving at the sentences\nimposed.She failed to give sufficient weight to his mental disorders, while\noveremphasizing specific deterrence and imposing a 5 year sentence for breach\nof probation which carries a maximum sentence of 2 years.The Appellant’s Background[8]The\nappellant was 42 years old when sentenced.He exhibited behavioural problems\nas a child and spent time at a secure training school for boys where he was\nphysically and sexually abused.His sister was raped and murdered.As a young\nadult, he showed signs of schizophrenia, although it appears he has never been\nformally diagnosed.He became addicted to cocaine and began his extensive life\nof crime at an early age.His mental illnesses went untreated for many years\nuntil he began medication and psychological and psychiatric treatment programs\nin 2006.At the time of some of the offences, he had discontinued his\nmedications, begun drinking alcohol and had deteriorated badly.As is often\nthe case, the appellant did better when he adhered to his treatment programs.Discussion[9]The\nappellant argues that the sentences are excessive because the sentencing judge\nfailed to take into account his mental illness.We do not accept this\nproposition.[10]The appellant appears never to have been\nformally diagnosed with schizophrenia.He tendered no medical evidence to the\ncourt.For purposes of this discussion, however, we are prepared to accept\nthat he suffered from some form of mental illness.The sentencing judge was\nclearly sensitive to his illness as is evident in the following remarks:...What it really gets down to is that it is\nvery difficult to punish someone with a harsh or at least a long sentence when\none knows very well that there is an underlying mental illness.Being punished\nwhen you are ill is problematic.On the other hand, there are other considerations\nthat have to be brought to bear and it is not as if his mental illness is not\nsomething that could not be managed, in fact was for a short period of time,\nand it is not as if his mental illness interfered with his basic cognitive\nabilities either....Turning to the issue of mental illness, his\nlongstanding association with a psychiatrist and other supports in the\ncommunity are set out in the PSR.It appears that he is someone who suffers\nfrom schizophrenia and bi-polar disorder, and also has seizures.I am not sure\nwhat the basis of it is, but there is some suggestion of nerve damage, and\nADHD...[11]In order for a mental illness to be considered\nas a mitigating factor in sentencing, the offender must show a causal link\nbetween his illness and his criminal conduct, that is, the illness is an\nunderlying reason for his aberrant conduct:R. v. Robinson, [1974] O.J.\nNo. 585 (C.A.).[12]Further, there must be evidence that a lengthy\nsentence would have a severe negative effect on the offender such that it should\nbe reduced on compassionate grounds.[13]The evidence before the sentencing judge did not\nsupport such a conclusion in this case.Some of his offences occurred before\nhe discontinued his medications and some after.Neither of his psychologist or\npsychiatrist supported the theory of a causal link between his illness and his\nbehaviour.Further, although his psychiatrist described him as “vulnerable”,\nthere was no evidence that the negative impact of prison would reach the level\nrequired to warrant a reduced sentence.[15]The sentencing judge was very concerned about\nthe proper dispositions of this matter; she adjourned the sentencing hearing\ntwice to think further and to carefully consider the appropriate sentence,\ntaking into account the needs of the appellant and of her obligation to protect\nsociety.[16]She said:...To be frank, I have been over and over the\nmaterials a few times, have come to a situation where I actually don’t agree\nwith either party in terms of their submission.Through that process, I have\nmoments of difficulty, I would confess, even agreeing with myself.What it\nreally gets down to is that it is very difficult to punish someone with a harsh\nor at least a long sentence when one knows very well that there is an\nunderlying mental illness.Being punished when you are ill is problematic.On\nthe other hand, there are other considerations that have to be brought to bear\nand it is not as if his mental illness is not something that could not be\nmanaged, in fact was for a short period of time, and it is not as if his mental\nillness interfered with his basic cognitive abilities either.[17]The global sentence of 6 years, after the credit\nof 2 years, is a fit sentence in the circumstances of this case.The\nsentencing judge did not err in law.[18]We considered the fresh evidence that the\nappellant wished to tender about his current psychological condition and\nobserve that it would not affect our decision.[19]The appeal is dismissed.RELEASED:“DOC”“FEB 03 2012”“O’Connor\nJ.

Faria............................................................................for\nthe CrownMr. J.L. Hill.......................................................................................................for\nBrian DempseyBovard J.:[1]This is an Application by Detective Brian\nBorg, a peace officer of the City of Toronto, under s.487.055 (1) of the Criminal\nCode for an Authorization to take bodily substances for forensic DNA\nanalysis. Ms. S. Orlando and Ms. C. C. Faria appear for the Crown on the Application.Mr. J.L. Hill appears for Brian Dempsey, the subject of the Application.Disposition[2]After considering all of the evidence, the\nrelevant law and the submissions of counsel, I find that the Applicant has\nsatisfied all of the requirements of s. 487.055 (1), and that it is in the best\ninterests of the administration of justice that pursuant to that section I authorize\nin Form 5.06 the taking, from Brian Dempsey, for the purposes of forensic DNA\nanalysis, of any number of samples of bodily substances that is reasonably\nrequired for that purpose, by means of the investigative procedures described\nin subsection 487.06 (1).Background[3]On July 22, 1997 Mr. Justice Ferguson of the\nOntario Court (General Division), as it then was, sentenced Brian Dempsey to\neight years in the penitentiary for manslaughter.Mr. Dempsey’s warrant expiry\ndate was July 21, 2005.However, it was extended by two days because Mr.\nDempsey was released on statutory release on August 30, 2004 and this statutory\nrelease was suspended on September 4, 2004. He was not arrested until two days\nlater, so he was at large without authorization for those two days, and\nconsequently, his sentence was not running during those two days.Therefore,\nhis warrant expiry date had to be extended by two days to July 23, 2005.[1] This Application was filed in the\nOntario Court of Justice on July 22, 2005.Issues[4]The issues raised by defence counsel are the\nfollowing.1. The Application\nis out of time by one day.2. The Application does not comply with the spirit\nof the substantive and proce-dural requirements of s. 487.055 and\nwith the principles of fairness.3. The Crown did not prove that s. 487.055 is\nlegitimate legislation.[5]The enabling legislation pursuant to which\nDetective Borg makes his Application is s.487.055 (1) of the Criminal Code.\nI will set out the subsections that are relevant to the Application before me.487.055(1) Offenders serving\nsentencesA provincial court judge may, on ex parte\napplication made in Form 5.05, authorize in Form 5.06 the taking, for the\npurpose of forensic DNA analysis, of any number of samples of bodily substances\nthat is reasonably required for that purpose, by means of the investigative\nprocedures described in subsection 487.06(1), from a person who, before June\n30, 2000,(e) had been\nconvicted of manslaughter and, on the date of the application, is serving a\nsentence of imprisonment of at least two years for that offence.487.055(2) CertificateThe application shall be accompanied by a\ncertificate referred to in paragraph 667(1)(a) that establishes that the person\nis a person referred to in subsection (1). The certificate may be received in\nevidence without giving the notice referred to in subsection 667(4).487.055(3.1) CriteriaIn deciding whether to grant an\nauthorization under subsection (1), the court shall consider the person's\ncriminal record, the nature of the offence and the circumstances surrounding\nits commission and the impact such an authorization would have on the privacy\nand security of the person and shall give reasons for its decision.(1) Is the Application out of time?(2) Is the Application deficient substantively or procedurally?[6]These two issues are so intertwined that I\nhave to discuss them together. Defence counsel, Mr. Hill, pointed out that\nsubsection 487.055 (1) (e) requires that Mr. Dempsey be “serving a sentence of\nimprisonment of at least two years” for his manslaughter conviction on the date\nthat the Application is made. Mr. Dempsey was sentenced to eight years in\nprison on July 22, 1997.His warrant expiry date would be July 21, 2005. The Application\nwas filed with the Court on July 22, 2005; therefore, the Crown is late by one\nday.[7]The evidence that Mr. Dempsey is “serving a\nsentence of at least two years” for his manslaughter conviction is a letter\nfrom, Leslie Milbury, which is exhibit 4 to Applicant’s Affidavit. The letter\nstates:The sentence on Manslaughter\noriginally ran from 22 Jul 97 to 21 Jul 05.However, Mr. Dempsey was released\non statutory release on 30 Aug 04; the statutory release was suspended on 04\nSep 04; he was not arrested until two days later, i.e. 07 Sep 04. Consequently,\nthe end date of 21 Jul 05 had to be adjusted to 23 Jul 05 to reflect those two\ndays at large.[8]Mr. Hill concedes that if this letter is\naccepted as evidence, the Crown has satisfied all of the requirements of s.\n487.055 (1) and the Application succeeds.However, he argues that it should\nnot be accepted as evidence for the following reasons.1.It is not in the form of an Affidavit and it\nshould be, because it would make the procedure fairer.2.Ms. Milbury should have provided an explanation\nof how the warrant expiry date was calculated, and the decision sheets of the\nParole Board that suspended Mr. Dempsey’s statutory release should have been\nprovided.3.Ms. Milbury does not refer to the fact that Mr.\nDempsey’s criminal record shows that he was released on statutory release on\nNovember 20, 2002 and recommitted on February 25, 2003. She only mentions the\nstatutory release and recommittal that occurred in August and September of\n2004.[9]With regard to the first point, there is\nnothing in s. 487.055 (1) that requires that the information given by Ms.\nMilbury be in Affidavit form.And Mr. Hill did not provide any authority that\nwould require it.Neither did he present any persuasive argument that it\nshould be so.In R. v. Jackpine[2]\nMr. Justice Doherty explained the nature of these Applications.In holding that\nnotice should generally be given to the subject of the application, I do not\nmean to suggest that a proceeding under s. 487.055(1) should take on the\ntrappings of a criminal trial. I see no place for the strict application of the\nrules of evidence, the assigning of burdens of proof or the re-litigation of factual\nor legal issues decided in previous proceedings involving the offender who is\nthe subject of the application. A summary form of procedure would be\nappropriate as long as it would allow for the effective exercise of the\ndiscretion called for under the section, and would be responsive to the\nparticular issues that arise on the specific application. I would think that\nin most cases the judge can rely on transcripts from prior proceedings,\npre-sentence reports, victim impact statements and criminal records unless the\nsubject of the application, having been given an opportunity to do so, can show\ncause why the material should not be relied on by the judge. The manner in\nwhich the subject of the application can challenge the Crown material should\ndepend on the nature of the challenge and the nature of the material. I do\nnot think that cross-examination will always be necessary to afford the\nrequisite procedural fairness. Procedural matters will have to be worked out on\na case-by-case basis. (Emphasis Added)[10]Jackpine\nstands for the proposition that these Applications should proceed under much\nless stringent evidentiary requirements than do trials.I cannot see any\nreason why in the case at bar the information that Ms. Milbury gave in her\nletter, which is an exhibit to the Applicant’s Affidavit in support of the\nApplication, should be in Affidavit form.I cannot see how it would make the\nprocedure fairer as argued by Mr. Hill. It is not her Application; it is\nDetective Borg’s.[11]With regard to the second point, Ms. Milbury\ndid provide an explanation of how the warrant expiry date was calculated. She\nis the Regional Advisor for Sentence Management for the Correctional Service of\nCanada. Her qualifications to state what she did in her letter were not\nchallenged by the defence, and there is nothing before me on which I could base\na doubt about her competence to make the statements, or on which I could found\na doubt about the calculation of Mr. Dempsey’s warrant expiry date.[12]Mr. Hill further argued that Ms. Milbury did\nnot make reference to the fact that Mr. Dempsey’s criminal record (Exhibit 2 to\nDetective Borg’s Affidavit) shows that he was released on statutory release on\nNovember 20, 2002 and recommitted on February 25, 2003 for violating his\nrelease.Mr. Hill submitted that leaving this information out of her letter\nshows that she was “wrong”. However, there is nothing before me that makes this\nomission relevant to the calculation of his warrant expiry date on the\nmanslaughter conviction, therefore, I conclude that it is of no consequence to\nthe calculation that Ms. Milbury made.[13]Mr. Hill also urged me not to accept the\nCPIC print out of Mr. Dempsey’s criminal record as evidence.He analogized to\na sentencing hearing where the accused person must admit the criminal record\nbefore it is considered by the sentencing judge.[14]He suggested that the Crown should be\nrequired to produce certified copies of all warrants of committal and attach\nthem as exhibits to the Affidavit in support of the Application.First of all,\nthis is not a sentencing hearing so Mr. Hill’s analogy is flawed.Secondly, as\nDougherty J.A. stated in Jackpine (supra):…in most cases the\njudge can rely on transcripts from prior proceedings, pre-sentence reports,\nvictim impact statements and criminal records unless the subject of the\napplication, having been given an opportunity to do so, can show cause why the\nmaterial should not be relied on by the judge. (Emphasis Added)[15]I cannot see any reason not to rely on the\nCPIC print out of Mr. Dempsey’s criminal record. In addition to the CPIC print\nout, Exhibit 1 of Detective Borg’s Affidavit is the Certificate Of Conviction\nOr Discharge of Mr. Dempsey’s conviction for manslaughter on July 22, 1997.Mr. Dempsey’s fingerprints accompany this document and a named fingerprint\nexaminer certified that he was indeed convicted of that offence on that date.[16]The last point that Mr. Hill made regarding\nMs. Milbury’s letter is that she, or the Applicant, should have provided the\nParole Board’s decision sheets regarding the suspension of Mr. Dempsey’s\nstatutory release.[17]He submits that in order for two days to be\nadded to Mr. Dempsey’s manslaughter sentence, he would have had to appear\nbefore the Parole Board at a post suspension hearing. But then he said that it\nwas unlikely that such a hearing would have taken place, because Mr. Dempsey\nwas awaiting trial for possession of stolen property, for which he was\nconvicted on September 15, 2004 and received a consecutive 15 month jail term.[18]He goes on to speculate that if the Parole\nBoard cancelled the suspension, then the two extra days would not have been\nadded to his manslaughter sentence.He states that in order to prove that the\nApplication is within the statutory time limit prescribed in s. 487.055 (1),\nthe Crown has to produce the decision sheets showing that they decided to revoke\nhis statutory release before he was sentenced on the possession of stolen\nproperty charge.Because if the Parole Board revoked his statutory release,\nand the two days that he was at large were added to his manslaughter sentence\nafter he was sentenced on the possession of stolen property charge, the two\nsentences would have merged. This is important because according to R. v.\nCarrignan (2003), 2003 CanLII 19233 (ON CA), 172 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (C.A.), for the purpose of s. 487.055\n(1), consecutive sentences cannot be merged into one sentence for determining\nwhether on the date of the Application Mr. Dempsey was serving the manslaughter\nsentence.[19]I find this submission confusing in that Mr.\nHill is requesting decision sheets from a Parole Board hearing that he states\nprobably did not take place.Even assuming, without finding, that the Crown\nshould have produced the decision sheets, I do not know how the Crown can\nproduce something that, according to the defence, more likely than not does not\nexist.Furthermore, there is no authority that says that the Crown is required\nto produce every single document that might be available to establish the\ncriteria set out in s. 487.055(1).[20]If one document suffices, is not necessary\nto produce one or two additional documents that prove the same thing.In a\ndifferent set of circumstances Mr. Hill’s argument could potentially have\nmerit.But in the case before me, I find that his argument rests on the\nhypothetical and theoretical plane and, therefore, it has no specific\napplication to the case before me.I find that Ms. Milbury’s letter more than\nserves to establish Mr. Dempsey’s warrant expiry date, especially in the\nabsence of any tenable challenge to her statements. In terms of the evidentiary\nquality of Ms. Milbury’s letter, I find that it is greatly similar to a\npre-sentence report or a victim impact statement, which are documents on which Jackpine\n(Supra) said I can rely.[21]Mr. Hill also argued that adding the time\nthat elapsed between the issuance of the warrant of suspension of Mr. Dempsey’s\nstatutory release and its execution to his warrant expiry date for the\nmanslaughter sentence is an administrative act.And this should only be done\nafter the Parole Board decides to revoke his statutory release.Until the\nParole Board decides to revoke his statutory release it is not final that the\ntwo days he was at large before the warrant of suspension was executed should\nproperly be added to his sentence, because pursuant to s.135 (11) of the Corrections\nand Conditional Release Act[3],\nif the Board decides not to uphold the suspension, those two days will be\ncredited to his sentence.This also conforms with s. 128 (1) of the Act which\nstates that, “An offender who is released on…statutory release…continues, while\nentitled to be at large, to serve the sentence until its expiration according\nto law.”[22]He submitted that even after the Parole\nBoard revokes an inmate’s statutory release, the adding of the time that the\nperson was at large between the issuance of the warrant of suspension of a\nstatutory release and its execution, is an administrative penalty more akin to\na consecutive sentence than an alteration of the original sentence.On this\npoint it seems to me that if a person is sentenced to a penitentiary sentence\nand receives a statutory release which is suspended and that suspension is\nupheld by the Parole Board, the time that the person spent at large illegally\nbefore being re-incarcerated cannot count against his or her sentence.Otherwise, if the person is at large for one year, for example, and then was\ncaught, he or she would have cheated the administration of justice out of one\nyear of the sentence, and the court’s sentence would have been frustrated to\nthat extent.[23]As Ms. Faria, the Crown, argued, such a\nperson was sentenced to a term in jail fixed by the judge. If the person is\nfound to have been at large illegally, he or she has to make up that time in\norder that the judge’s sentence be completely purged.[24]Mr. Hill said that the Corrections and\nConditional Release Act does not address this problem and that there is no\nauthority on this point. In a case like the one before me, where there has been\nno conviction for unlawfully at large, and no proof that the Parole Board\nrevoked the statutory release, the time spent out of custody between the issuance\nof the warrant of suspension of the statutory release and its execution, should\nnot be added to the sentence.Therefore, the Application is out of time.[25]These are interesting arguments, but the\nCrown has produced a letter from the Regional Advisor for Sentence Management\nfor the Correctional Service of Canada that states that Mr. Dempsey’s warrant\nexpiry date was extended by two days because his statutory release was\nsuspended and he was not arrested for two days.I find that prima facie\nthis letter is credible and trustworthy and is sufficient to establish that Mr.\nDempsey’s warrant expiry date for the manslaughter conviction was extended by\nthe two days that he was at large between the issuance of the warrant of\nsuspension of his statutory release and its execution.The defence did not\ncross-examine the Applicant on his Affidavit, nor did it call evidence to\nundermine Ms. Milbury’s statements. I find that Jackpine allows me to\nrely on evidence such as Ms. Milbury’s letter, “unless the subject of the\napplication, having been given an opportunity to do so, can show cause why the\nmaterial should not be relied on…”[26]I do not agree with the defence that Mr.\nDempsey has to be found guilty of being unlawfully at large before the extension\nof his warrant expiry date would be legal. Mr. Hill did not give me any\nauthority to support this argument and based on my reading of the Corrections\nand Conditional Release Act I cannot find any such requirement before an\ninmate’s statutory release is suspended and or revoked. Mr. Hill concedes that\n“ …in calculations of warrant expiry date, the Correctional Service of Canada\nroutinely moves the warrant expiry date forward when the National Parole Board\nat a post suspension hearing revokes the conditional release of an offender by\nan amount equal to the full days between the signing of a warrant of suspension\nand the offender’s return to custody under that warrant. In Mr. Dempsey’s case\nthat period is 2 days.” [4]He argues that there is not authority in the Criminal Code or in the Corrections\nand Conditional Release Act to do this.Therefore, it is an administrative\nact that has not been challenged.[27]I find that it is quite logical not to\ncredit an inmate with time during which he or she was at liberty while his or\nher statutory release was suspended or revoked.The reasonableness of doing\nthis is so obvious that there is no need for “authority” to justify it.[28]Contrary to Mr. Hill’s argument, the adding\non of this time is not a presumption that he is guilty of the offence of being\nunlawfully at large, nor is it an “administrative extension” of the original\nsentence. It is simply the carrying out the sentence that Mr. Justice Ferguson\npassed on Mr. Dempsey by adding the two days to his warrant expiry date during\nwhich he was not legally at large.[29]It is telling that Mr. Hill does not\ncontest the new warrant expiry date for Mr. Dempsey.Rather, he argues that\nthe Crown should have produced the Parole Board’s decision sheets concerning\nits review of the suspension of his statutory release. This submission is\npremised on a contention that the Crown has to prove that the Board upheld the\nsuspension and revoked his statutory release before I can find that the two\nextra days were properly added to his warrant expiry date. Mr. Hill argued\nforcefully that I not accept Ms. Milbury’s letter, however, in the absence of\ninformation, evidence, or arguments based on more than speculation and\nconjecture that undermine Ms. Milbury’s letter, I find that the Crown is entitled\nto rely on the letter to establish that Mr. Dempsey’s warrant expiry date was\nproperly extended by the two days that he was at large without authorization\nbetween the issuance of the warrant of suspension of his statutory release and\nits execution.[30]I agree with Ms. Faria’s submission that\nin keeping with the spirit of Jackpine (Supra) these Applications should\nnot be turned into trials. Innocence is not at stake and that is an important\nfactor in why Mr. Justice Dougherty said that the proceedings under s. 487.055\n(1) should not “take on the trappings of a criminal trial” and that there is\n“no place for the strict application of the rules of evidence [or] the\nassigning of burdens of proof…”, and that, “A summary form of procedure would\nbe appropriate as long as it would allow for the effective exercise of the\ndiscretion called for under the section, and would be responsive to the particular\nissues that arise on the specific application.”[31]For the reasons stated above, I find that in\nthe case before me the evidence that the Crown adduced is sufficient for me to\neffectively exercise the discretion called for under s. 487.055 (1) and to\nadequately respond to the issue of Mr. Dempsey’s proper warrant expiry date.The Crown did not prove that s. 487.055 is legitimate legislation.[32]Mr. Hill’s last argument is that s. 487.055\n(1) is unconstitutional.He concedes that Jackpine decided that it is,\nand that I am bound by that decision.However, he makes the argument, as was\ndone in Jackpine, to preserve his right to make this argument at a later\ndate should the Supreme Court of Canada hold that it is unconstitutional.Evidently, the Supreme Court is going to decide the issue later this year.Therefore, being bound by Jackpine, I reject this argument.[33]I will not discuss the other requirements in\ns. 487.055 (1) because the defence concedes them.Disposition[34]After considering all of the evidence, the\nrelevant law and the submissions of counsel, I find that the Applicant has\nsatisfied all of the requirements of s. 487.055 (1), and that it is in the best\ninterests of the administration of justice that pursuant to that section I authorize\nin Form 5.06 the taking, from Brian Dempsey, for the purposes of forensic DNA\nanalysis, of any number of samples of bodily substances that is reasonably\nrequired for that purpose, by means of the investigative procedures described\nin subsection 487.06 (1).Released:October 17, 2005Signed: “Justice J.

G.APPELLANT / accusedv.HER MAJESTY THE QUEENRESPONDENT / prosecutrixJUDGMENT[1]On September 25, 2010, a jury convicted the appellant\nof 11 charges relating to various acts of conjugal and family violence. On\nJanuary 5, 2011, the Superior Court, District of Montreal (the Honourable\nClaude Champagne), sentenced the appellant to a total of 30 months’\nimprisonment (36 months less 3 months of detention between the verdict and\nsentencing, which were given double credit).[2]The appellant is appealing the convictions, and in\nthis regard he obtained an extension of the deadline to appeal.[1]\nHe now asks to be released from custody pending the outcome of the appeal\nproceedings.[3]This application is governed by paragraphs 679 (1)(a)\nand (3) Cr. C.:679. (1) A judge of the court of\nappeal may, in accordance with this section, release an appellant from custody\npending the determination of his appeal if,(a) in the case of an appeal to the court of\nappeal against conviction, the appellant has given notice of appeal\nor, where leave is required, notice of his application for leave to appeal\npursuant to section 678;…(3) In\nthe case of an appeal referred to in paragraph (1)(a) or (c),\nthe judge of the court of appeal may order that the appellant be released\npending the determination of his appeal if the appellant establishes that(a) the appeal or application for leave to\nappeal is not frivolous;(b) he will surrender himself into custody in\naccordance with the terms of the order; and(c) his detention is not necessary in the public\ninterest.…[4]Are the criteria, which are cumulative,\nprescribed by this section met? The appellant has the burden of establishing\nthat they are.[5]Is the appeal frivolous? As noted above, the appellant has obtained an extension of the\ndeadline to appeal. This means that a judge of this Court has already ruled\nthat the grounds of appeal are arguable, or serious if one prefers, in\naccordance with the standard set out in Lamontagne v. R., 1994 CanLII 6295 (QC CA), J.E. 95-28\n(C.A.), which has since been applied consistently by this Court. That standard is\nanalogous to the one applicable to release from custody pursuant to paragraph\n679(3)(a) Cr. C. Commenting\non this provision in Guité v. R., 2006 QCCA 905 (CanLII), [2006] R.J.Q. 2049 (C.A.), Doyon J.A. explained\nthat:[translation][7]Moreover, the applicant is not required to prove that his grounds of\nappeal are well founded. It is sufficient for him to establish that the issues\nraised are arguable (Garneau v. R., 1997 CanLII 9947 (QC CA), REJB 1997-04154, (C.A.)), and he is not required to demonstrate that\nhis grounds have a strong chance of success (R. v. S. (J.T.) (1996), 1996 ABCA 374 (CanLII), 4\nC.R. (5th) 19 (Alta. C.A.)).[8]As Rochon J.A. noted in Duhamel v. R., 2002 CanLII 41275 (QC CA), REJB 2002-35700 (C.A.), it is inappropriate for the judge seized\nof such a motion to rule on the merits of the underlying case. That said, the\njudge must answer the question regarding the frivolousness of the appeal because\nthat is one of the factors to consider. This does not, however, in any way bind\nthe bench that will hear the appeal. Therefore, I need not rule on the actual\nstrength of the grounds of appeal, which is the role of the judges seized of\nthe appeal on its merits, but solely on the frivolousness of these grounds.[6]In the circumstances, it would be inconsistent\nto conclude now that the appellant’s grounds of appeal are frivolous, considering\nthat a judge of this Court has already found them to be arguable.[7]The Crown asserts, however, that it is actually impossible\nto assess the grounds of appeal since the appellant did not join to his application\nthe relevant passages of the trial transcripts, without which the grounds of\nappeal cannot be assessed. It asserts that this is particularly true with\nrespect to the third ground as we do not know why the judge dismissed the objection\nand that, consequently, it is impossible to know whether the appellant has any\nreason to complain.[8]Further, according to the Crown, if these\ntranscripts had been filed, they would not support what the appellant now\nasserts. In regard to the first ground (discussion between the judge and a\nprospective juror), the transcripts would show that the appellant now adopts a\nposition contrary to that he took before the trial judge. With respect to the\nsecond ground, the transcripts would show that the appellant’s attorney\ndeclared that he was satisfied with the judge’s instructions to the jury and\nthe manner in which the judge managed the incident that he now criticizes.[9]In regard to the final ground of appeal, the\nCrown asserts that it lacks sufficient detail to communicate the actual issue.[10]In the circumstances, these arguments are not convincing, and the Crown’s assertion goes\ntoo far. First of all, the grounds set out in the notice of appeal are\nsufficiently detailed to allow one to form a preliminary idea and appear serious\non their face. While it is true that the appellant must demonstrate that his\ngrounds of appeal are not frivolous and must include support for this with his application,\nhe is not required to provide the equivalent of that which will be necessary to\ndecide the appeal on its merits. Yet that seems to be what the Crown is\ninsisting on here. Moreover, considering that the grounds of appeal were\nalready found to be arguable at the stage of the extension of the deadline to\nappeal, the Crown could have supported its challenge more substantially by adding\nsomething to demonstrate the frivolousness of the grounds of appeal. What has been\nput forth in this regard is not sufficient.[11]The appeal appears arguable. The first criterion\nis thus met.[12]Will the appellant surrender\nhimself into custody in accordance with the terms of the order of this Court,\nif applicable? This criterion\nis set out in paragraph 679(3)(b) Cr. C., and the Crown does not\ndispute that it is met. The appellant was released throughout the duration of\nthe trial proceedings (approximately eighteen months) and was incarcerated only\nafter the guilty verdict was rendered. He complied with the conditions imposed\non him and surrendered when so ordered without attempting to escape justice.\nThere is nothing to suggest that he would behave differently now or that there\nis a serious risk in this regard.[13]Is the detention of the appellant necessary\nin the public interest? According to Takri v. R.,\n2010 QCCA 1064 (CanLII), J.E. 2010-1060, this criterion [translation] “refers to both protection and safety of the public as well as public\nconfidence in the administration of justice, having regard to the circumstances\nof the case (R. v. Rochon, 2008 QCCA 2142 (CanLII), 2008 QCCA 2142 (C.A.)”.[14]The Crown does not dispute that the first part\nof this criterion is met. The fact that the appellant was released without incident\nthroughout the duration of the trial proceedings demonstrates that there is no\nthreat, or at least no apparent threat, to the safety of the public, including\nthat of the complainants. With respect to the complainants, it should be noted\nthat the appellant’s release from custody, if ordered, will be subject to\nconditions that the appellant will be required to strictly observe and that are\nintended to protect them. It goes without saying that any deviation from these\nconditions would be sanctioned by the appellant’s immediate incarceration.[15]With respect to the second part of this\ncriterion, however, the Crown claims that the appellant’s release from custody\nwould likely undermine public confidence in the justice system in view of the\nseriousness and the number of offences of which the appellant has been convicted,\nas well as the aggravating factors listed in the sentencing decision. At this\nstage, the appellant no longer benefits from the presumption of innocence, and\nthis should also be taken into consideration. Also to be considered is the fact\nthat the Crown, which sought a seven-year prison sentence at trial, has been\ngranted leave to appeal the sentence, which in its view is too lenient.[16]After careful consideration, the undersigned is\nnot convinced by these arguments. Rather, it seems that an informed public, aware\nthat the appeal is not frivolous and that the appellant will surrender himself\ninto custody if so ordered, would accept the appellant’s release during the\nappeal proceedings. In Pearson v. R., J.E. 90-832 (C.A.), Fish J.A. stated that:An\ninformed public, fully appreciative of the rules applicable under our system of\njustice, would in my respectful view endorse the interim release of the Appellant\nin this matter, bearing in mind that his appeal is on its face serious, that he\nappears likely to surrender if his appeal fails, certain to be unnecessarily\npunished if his appeal succeeds, and that it has not been contended that he\nwill commit further offences if he is set free.[17]These words, written in 1990, remain true 21\nyears later and are particularly appropriate in this case. It is true that the\ncrimes are inherently serious, but in the circumstances, this alone cannot\njustify keeping the appellant incarcerated during the appeal. As Doyon J.A.\nnoted in Guité v. R., supra:[translation][6]In regard to the first,\nthe crimes are serious, but the seriousness of the offence does not mean that\nthe appellant must necessarily be incarcerated pending the outcome of the\nappeal. No offence, even the most serious, is excluded.[18]As noted above, at trial the Crown sought a\nseven-year prison sentence and requested that the appellant not be eligible for\nparole until after having served half of his sentence. The sentence imposed by\nthe judge, however, in what appears to be a carefully thought-out decision, was\n36 months, which provides an indication of the objective and subjective\nseriousness of the crimes from his perspective. Moreover, the judge explicitly\nrefused to order that the appellant serve half of his sentence before being\neligible for parole. The only indisputable element that we have in this case is\nthat the trial judge presided the trial and heard the witnesses (the appellant\ndid not testify), and the sentence that he imposed in full knowledge of the\ncircumstances is presumed to be valid and just, which allows us to gauge the\nseriousness of the crimes at issue. That the Crown is appealing this sentence\nshould not lead us to conclude that his release from custody should be refused.\nMoreover, the fact that crimes of conjugal and family violence are at issue is\nnot a bar to release, as demonstrated by the abundant case law in this regard.[19]Other factors must also be considered. The\nappellant has an occupation (although he is not currently employed). If he is\nreleased, he will have a fixed address. Most of all, he did not breach the\nconditions of his release during the proceedings before the Superior Court.He\ndoes not engage in a lifestyle that could be qualified as criminal (although he\ndoes have a criminal record dating back to 1999 for having used a stolen credit\ncard). He is certainly not an exemplary citizen, but the public will bear in\nmind that if his appeal is dismissed, he will serve his sentence. The same\npublic will also bear in mind that if his appeal is allowed, he would have likely\nserved a good part of this sentence unnecessarily.[20]The third criterion of paragraph 679(3) Cr.\nC., like the first two, is also met. The appellant should therefore be released\nfrom custody, subject however to certain conditions.[21]FOR THESE REASONS, THE UNDERSIGNED:[22]GRANTS the\nappellant’s application for release from custody;[23]ORDERS that the\nappellant be released from custody on the following conditions:-Keep the peace, be of good behaviour, and appear\nbefore the court when required;-Reside at ..., City of A, Quebec;-Not change addresses without the prior\nauthorization of the Court or one of its judges;-Not leave the province of Quebec without\nthe prior authorization of the Court or one of it judges;-Inform the Court in writing of the name\nand contact information of his employer, within ten (10) days of the date of\nfinding a job;-Appear at the police station closest to\nhis residence, once a week on Wednesday, to report and sign the register,\nstarting on Wednesday, March 23, 2011;-Not be within a 100-metre radius of the\ndomicile or workplace of S.

All of them agreed to this suggestion\nand, apparently, told the police that the appellant had been driving.[8]When the police arrived at\napproximately 5:44 a.m., the appellant identified himself as the driver.Constable Bear quickly noted that the appellant was exhibiting indicia of\nimpairment and, at 6:04 a.m., demanded that he provide a breath sample.By\n6:07 a.m., Constable Bear and the appellant were on their way to the police\nstation so the appellant could provide a breath sample.The remaining four\noccupants of the vehicle were all taken to hospital to be examined for\ninjuries.[9]At the police station, Constable Bear\ncautioned the appellant and, between 6:15 a.m. and 6:23 a.m., the appellant\nmade several unsuccessful attempts to contact his lawyer.At approximately\n6:23 a.m., the appellant, when asked if he had any questions for Constable\nBear, said: “Why am I here?”Constable Bear reminded the appellant that he was\nto provide samples of his breath.At this point, the appellant recanted from\nhis statement that he had been driving.When reminded of what he had told\nConstable Bear at the scene of the accident, the appellant said: “Well, I lied\nup there.”[10]At 6:25 a.m., another constable spoke\nwith the appellant about providing breath samples.The police subsequently obtained\nbreath samples indicating that the appellant had 160 milligrams of alcohol in\n100 millilitres of blood – or twice the legal limit.[11]Although lucid at the scene, Ms. Hodder\nhad suffered a number of fractured ribs, one of which had punctured a lung and\nresulted in significant blood loss.Ms. Hodder passed away from her injuries\nshortly after arriving at the hospital.She was 16 years of age.[12]When the police became aware of Ms.\nHodder’s death, they re-warned the appellant on the charge of impaired driving\ncausing death.At this point, the appellant again told the police that he had\nnot been driving at the time of the accident.However, given that the\nstatements from the passengers all indicated that the appellant had been the\ndriver, the police were sceptical of the appellant’s second attempt to recant\nfrom his earlier statement.[13]By the time the police acted on the new\ninformation that Mr. Wiegers had been driving, they were not allowed to make a\nbreath demand upon Mr. Wiegers as the three hour window to do so had\nelapsed.While the police did obtain new witness statements and a warrant for\nany bodily substances that may have been taken from Mr. Wiegers at the\nhospital, the evidence obtained was insufficient to show intoxication or\nimpairment on his part.The police did not obtain a warned statement from Mr.\nWiegers.[14]Approximately two years later, the\npolice charged the appellant with obstruction.Analysis[15]The Supreme Court of Canada concisely\nsummarized the principles of appellate review of sentence decisions in R. v.\nL.M., 2008 SCC 31 (CanLII), [2008] 2 S.C.R. 163:[14]... [A]ppellate courts must show\ngreat deference in reviewing decisions of trial judges where appeals against\nsentence are concerned. An appellate court may not vary a sentence simply\nbecause it would have ordered a different one. The court must be ‘convinced it\nis not fit’, that is, ‘that ...the sentence [is] clearly unreasonable’ (R. v.\nShropshire, 1995 CanLII 47 (SCC), [1995] 4 S.C.R. 227, at para. 46, quoted in R. v. McDonnell,\n1997 CanLII 389 (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 948, at para. 15). This Court also made the following comment\nin R. v. M.(C.A.), 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, at para. 90:...absent an error in principle, failure to consider a relevant factor,\nor an overemphasis of the appropriate factors, a court of appeal should only\nintervene to vary [page 173] a sentence imposed at trial if the sentence is\ndemonstrably unfit.[15]Owing to the profoundly contextual\nnature of the sentencing process, in which the trier of fact has broad\ndiscretion, the standard of review to be applied by an appellate court is one\nbased on deference. The sentencing judge has ‘served on the front lines of our\ncriminal justice system’ and possesses unique qualifications in terms of\nexperience and the ability to assess the submissions of the Crown and the offender\n(M. (C.A.), at para. 91).[16]The appellant’s crime was that of wilful\nobstruction pursuant to s. 129(a) of the Criminal Code, which\nreads:129. Offences relating to public or peace\nofficerEvery one who(a)resists\nor wilfully obstructs a public officer or peace officer in the execution of his\nduty or any person lawfully acting in aid of such an officer,…is guilty of(d)an\nindictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two\nyears, or(e)an\noffence punishable on summary conviction.[17]A sentence should be proportionate to\nthe seriousness of the crime committed.Section 718.1 of the Criminal Code also\nmandates that the sentencing judge give the degree of responsibility of the\noffender equal consideration.In applying the standard of review in this\nappeal, we were of the view that the sentencing judge committed errors of\nprinciple that led to a mischaracterization of the seriousness of the offence\ncommitted by the appellant and, thus, to a mischaracterization of the moral\nculpability of the appellant.These errors in principle warranted appellate\nintervention.[18]First, the sentencing judge failed to\nconsider a relevant factor – the nature of the appellant’s offence.The facts\nof this case are peculiar.The appellant did not lie to the police to avoid\ncriminal liability, as is usually the case under s. 129(a).In this case, the\nappellant had no criminal liability to avoid.Here, the appellant lied to the\npolice in a futile attempt to preserve the insurance on his vehicle (See Transcript,\nat p. 12-13).However, aside from insurance fraud, the effect of the\nappellant’s lie was that he temporarily assumed responsibility for having\ndriven the vehicle, and he appears not to have appreciated the legal\nramifications of that assumption of responsibility. This peculiarity complicates\nthe determination of an appropriate sentence for the appellant.Sentences for\nobstruction are generally imposed contemporaneously with sentences for the\nprimary offences (from which the accused had sought to avoid criminal liability\nby obstructing the police) and are either said to run concurrent or form part\nof a global sentence.In that respect, a concurrent or global sentence of\nincarceration on a conviction for obstruction does not further the sentencing principles\nof denunciation and deterrence beyond the primary offences and, accordingly,\nthe case law is of little assistance.Here, obstruction is the only offence\nand an appropriate sentence must, of itself, fit the circumstances within the\nfundamental purpose and the principles of sentencing.[19]Second, the sentencing judge\noveremphasized two relevant factors – the seriousness of the offence and\nappellant’s moral culpability.This second error stems from the sentencing\njudge’s misapprehensions as to the evidence and the improper tying of the\nappellant’s offence to the death of Ms. Hodder.[20]Although entirely inadvertent, the\nsentencing judge was under the misapprehension that the appellant only recanted\nfrom his statement that he was the driver upon being charged with impaired\ndriving causing death (see the Transcript, at p. 6).The Crown acknowledged\nbefore us that the appellant in fact recanted from his statement before the police\nbecame aware of Ms. Hodder’s death and before the police had re-warned and\ncharged him with impaired driving causing her death.Constable Bear’s notes,\nadmitted as fresh evidence in this appeal, substantiate this fact.However, through\nno fault of his own, the sentencing judge had a different understanding of the\nfacts and one that could serve to inappropriately inflate the appellant’s moral\nculpability for the offence.[21]Similarly, by tying the appellant’s\noffence to the death of Ms. Hodder, the sentencing judge improperly determined\nthe seriousness of that offence, and inflated the appellant’s moral culpability,\non the basis of the impact of Ms. Hodder’s death on her family.The sentencing\njudge may have fallen into this error by being misdirected to the victim impact\nstatements submitted in this case.These victim impact statements were\ninappropriate as Ms. Hodder’s death, and the overwhelming loss suffered by\nMs. Hodder’s family as a result, did not arise from the commission of the\nappellant’s offence (see s. 722(1)).[22]The characterization of Ms. Hodder as\nthe victim of the appellant’s offence is fundamentally flawed and served to\noveremphasize the seriousness of the offence.The determination of the\n“seriousness” of the appellant’s crime must be tied to the offence of\nobstruction, not the traffic accident that served to precipitate the offence,\nnor its consequences.At the time he committed his offence (by lying to the\npolice) he could not have known that Ms. Hodder was fatally injured.Her death\nand its consequences cannot be properly factored into the gravity of his\nconduct for the purposes of determining the seriousness of his offence or his\nmoral blameworthiness.In other words, the sentencing judge improperly magnified\nthe gravity of the unlawful act committed by the appellant by focusing on the\ndeath of Ms. Hodder and impact of her death on her family and, thereby,\nalso inflated the appellant’s moral culpability.[23]Third, the sentencing judge incorrectly\nassumed that the appellant was at fault for Mr. Wiegers escaping criminal\nliability for impaired driving causing death.The following is found at pp.\n10-13 of the transcript:THE COURT:Thank you very much.Well, you\ncan remain standing, please.I’m going to – I’m not going to adjourn\nsentencing in this matter.I’ll simply sentence him today at this point.Certainly, it’s a very useful thing for the courts, as well as for those in\nattendance and the family and relatives to hear what you have to say, most\nparticularly because Wiegers obviously does not feel the same way.Cody\nWiegers – that’s his first name, isn’t it, Cody?MR. SCOTT:Yes, it is, Your Honour.THE COURT:-- has appeared in front of me\nalmost monthly for a long time in the last number of months.He continues to\ncommit criminal offences and continues to be under the eye of the police.I\ncan only hope for the family that some day he is going to feel like you and\nwill take responsibility for what he did, so that – so that the – our system of\njustice can be – can be complied with and he can face his – what he needs to\nface.There is, of course, no statute of limitations in Canadian law for this\nkind of offence and though – so Mr. Wiegers can run, but it remains to be seen\nhow long he can hide – he can hide, but it remains to be seen how long it will\ntake before he is charged with this particular offence.When I sentenced\nChelsea Dagenais, I was – is her name Chelsea Dagenais?Yes.MR. SCOTTThat is correct.THE COURT:I was – I know the Crown wished –\nwanted there to be a jail sentence in that situation as well, but it was a\nconditional sentence and I was a bit taken aback by that because here’s this\nyoung woman lying on the ice and snow next to Ms. Hodder who died later on in\nthe hospital, with you and Ferris – you and Wiegers convincing everybody that\nthe best thing to do would be to pretend that you were driving.She, of\ncourse, was lying dazed on the ground, on the ice just as was Hodder.And I\ndidn’t feel in those circumstances there should be a sentence of jail.Your situation is\ndifferent, as I think you – as I think you realize, just based on what you’ve\ntold me.Not only because you have a criminal record, but also because you\nknow, it’s clear that for – I guess for the reasons you said in – in your\nstatements – or your conditional – in the pre-sentence report, that you felt\nsomehow insurance was going to come into effect here.Well, of course, it\nwould. No one has insurance when you operate a vehicle while you’re impaired,\nwhether it’s you or anybody else, whether it’s your or anybody else’s vehicle.But more than that, it was a, you know, plot hatched by the two of you to try\nto –MR. FERRIS:I take full responsibility for\ndoing that.I wanted to get insurance on my truck.THE COURT:-- I see, all right.Well, yeah,\nyou’ve, no doubt, learned that that wasn’t the case.MR. FERRIS: -- I was drunk and unable to\ndecide (inaudible).THE COURT:Good, all right.And, of\ncourse, the – it was agreed to by the – the young driver who was probably just\nas happy not to be charged with impaired driving causing, at that point, bodily\nharm and later causing death.So, anyway, yeah, I\nthink that – and this is the kind of offence if – if – that goes way beyond just\ngiving a false name, of course, so which is another type of obstruction.This\n– this developed, as you know, into an investigation in which went the wrong\nway and by the time it was turned around, it was too late to get the kind of\nevidence that courts require because there has to be proof beyond a reasonable\ndoubt.We can’t just charge somebody because we think he might be guilty and\nwe think we might be able to prove it.It has to be beyond a reasonable doubt\nand you of course, admitted your part in this and thus saved – saved us – saved\nthe system from having to go to the expense and time of having to prove guilt\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.[emphasis added.][24]The Crown’s recitation of the relevant\nfacts at the sentencing hearing was as follows (Transcript, pp. 6-7):MR. SCOTT:… This [the delay in determining\nwho was driving] deflected somewhat their investigation of what truly happened\nat – at this point in time.They attempted other statements and suffice it to\nsay that the statements are somewhat vague as to what was observed with respect\nto Mr. Wiegers prior to – prior to this collision or rolling of the – of the\nvehicle.As a result, the members were unable to get a warned statement from\nhim.He would have been – his – mother attended and – and was present with him\nat the hospital.The members indicate that the time limit for them to have\nmade the demand had – had past and that the witness statements were – were such\nthat they weren’t able to pursue that.There were attempts\nfurther in the investigation.There was a warrant that was done, for any\nbodily substances that may have been taken from Mr. Wiegers at the – at the\nhospital.The only thing that could be located was a urine sample at that\npoint in time.It was sent to lab.It indicated amounts of alcohol and\nvarious drugs; however, because it was a urine sample, they were unable to\nextrapolate it back to a blood sample.My understanding of the lab reports\nthat came about was that in order for a urine sample to have been of any use to\nthe lab, they would require a – knowing when the bladder was – was emptied\nlast, what the consumption was, and – and so that direction went – nowhere as\nwell.The officers who attended the scene with the accident reconstruction,\nthey advised that the road condition was such that they even had trouble\nstanding on the road, so they were unable to give any kind of indication as to\nwhat speed the vehicle was travelling when it – when it rolled on this occasion\nas – as well.[25]On the fresh evidence available on\nappeal, we know the appellant recanted his statement just over half an hour\nafter he made it.He recanted again a few minutes later and apparently still\nwithin an hour or so of the accident.The police accepted his new story subsequent\nto Ms. Hodder’s death, but while the other passengers remained at the hospital and\nthe police obtained new statements from them; albeit, the three-hour window to\nmake a breath demand on Mr. Wiegers had elapsed.[26]From the Crown’s comments at sentencing, we infer that the witnesses did not suggest any impairment or dangerous driving on the part of Mr. Wiegers.Furthermore, the prosecutor noted that the road conditions were such\nthat accident reconstruction officers experienced difficulties standing on the\nroad could not determine what speed the vehicle had been travelling.On the\nwhole, there was no evidence before the sentencing judge or\nbefore us to indicate that Mr. Wiegers was, in fact, impaired at the time of\nthe accident or that his manner of driving was in any way remarkable.Similarly, there was no evidence to suggest that the other passengers would\nhave given damning statements if Mr. Wiegers had been the focus of the police\ninvestigation from the start or even an hour earlier, or that a breath sample\nfrom Mr. Wiegers would have indicated blood alcohol content in excess of the\nlegal limit.There was no evidentiary basis upon which to draw the inference\nthat Mr. Wiegers would have been charged with a criminal offence, but for\nthe appellant’s lie. Therefore, by concluding that Mr. Wiegers had escaped\ncriminal liability for the accident by reason of the appellant’s offence, the sentencing\njudge again improperly magnified the gravity of the appellant’s unlawful act\nand further inflated his moral culpability.[27]The appellant was 20 years old at the\ntime of the accident, and is now 23 years of age.At the time of this offence,\nthe appellant had a criminal record for offences committed while he was subject\nto the Youth Criminal Justice Act; but those earlier convictions stemmed\nfrom a single spate of criminality in 2004.At the time of sentencing, we\nunderstand the appellant had two additional convictions for impaired driving\nand assault, but we have few details and these subsequent convictions did not\nplay a large role in the Crown’s submissions before us.The pre-sentence\nreport indicates that the appellant has had addictions issues, but has taken\nsteps to resolve his issues with alcohol and drugs.The appellant is employed\nin his community.The appellant has also started post-secondary education and,\nbased on the fresh evidence admitted in this Court, is successfully pursuing\nthis education.In sum, in the 32 months between the time of the accident and\nhis sentencing, the appellant had taken some steps backwards, but for the most\npart had successfully advanced his life toward becoming a productive\nmember of society.These factors were either not put to or not taken into\naccount by the sentencing judge.[28]Section 718.1 of the Criminal Code provides\nthat a sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the\ndegree of responsibility of the offender.Sentencing judges are owed\ndeference and latitude in crafting individualized sentences that reflect the\ngravity of the offence and the moral blameworthiness of the offender; but where, as here, a sentencing judge misapprehends both\nthe gravity of the offence and the moral culpability of the offender, the\nsentencing judge commits reviewable error that warrants appellate\nintervention.We therefore granted leave, allowed the appeal\nand set aside the sentence imposed in this case.[29]In determining the fit and proper sentence\nin this case, we considered the possibility of a conditional sentencing order\npursuant to s. 742.1 of the Criminal Code:742.1 Imposing of conditional sentenceIf a person is convicted of an offence, other\nthan a serious personal injury offence as defined in section 752, a terrorism\noffence or a criminal organization offence prosecuted by way of indictment for\nwhich the maximum term of imprisonment is ten years or more or an offence\npunishable by a minimum term of imprisonment, and the court imposes a sentence\nof imprisonment of less than two years and is satisfied that the service of the\nsentence in the community would not endanger the safety of the community and\nwould be consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing\nset out in sections 718 to 718.2, the court may, for the purpose of supervising\nthe offender's behaviour in the community, order that the offender serve the sentence\nin the community, subject to the offender's compliance with the conditions\nimposed under section 742.3.[30]By its language, s. 742.1 contains four prerequisites to imposing a conditional sentence; all\nof which were satisfied on the facts of this case:(i)The\nappellant has been convicted of obstruction which is not a serious personal\ninjury, terrorism or criminal organization offence nor an offence punishable by\na minimum term of imprisonment.(ii)Under\ns. 129, obstruction is punishable by imprisonment for a term not exceeding two\nyears.(iii)The\nappellant did not commit a violent offence here and there is no suggestion that\nthe appellant would pose a danger to the safety of his community if he were to\nserve a sentence in the community.(iv)The\nappellant’s service of a conditional sentence would be consistent with the\nfundamental purpose and principles of sentencing, namely to denounce unlawful\nconduct (s. 718(a)), to deter the appellant and others from committing offences\n(s. 718(b)), to assist in rehabilitating the appellant (s. 718(d)),\nto achieve proportionality with the gravity of the offence and the degree of the\nappellant’s responsibility (s. 718.1), and to ensure that the restrictive\nsanctions imposed on the appellant are reasonable and appropriate in the\ncircumstances (s. 718.2(d) and (e)).The appellant is a young man with a short\ncriminal record, who has since become a productive member of society, and who will\nbenefit from continued employment and from remaining in his educational\nprogram.The appellant made progress in his life during the two\nyears between the date of his offence and the date he was charged with that\noffence, and that progress continues.He has acknowledged and accepted his\nmoral culpability in the circumstances.Therefore, having regard to the factors\nset forth in R. v. Proulx, 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), [2000]\n1 S.C.R. 61, we were of the view that this was an\nappropriate case for a conditional sentencing order.[31]However, while a conditional sentence is a rehabilitative form of sentence, it is\nessential that the conditions imposed are severe enough to represent\ndenunciation of the offence and to act as a deterrent to others.In R. v. Proulx\n(at para. 36), Lamer C.J.C. adopted the words of Vancise J.A. of this\nCourt, in dissent in R. v. McDonald (1997), 1997 CanLII 9710 (SK CA), 113 C.C.C. (3d) 418 (at p. 443),\nwhere Vancise J.A. said that conditional sentences were designed to “permit the\naccused to avoid imprisonment, but not to avoid punishment.”Given its\npunitive purpose, breach of a conditional sentence order should be punished\nmore severely than a breach of a probation order, which has a rehabilitative\npurpose.In Proulx, Lamer C.J.C. wrote:[39]… [W]here an offender breaches a\ncondition without reasonable excuse, there should be a presumption that the\noffender serve the remainder of his or her sentence in jail.This constant\nthreat of incarceration will help ensure that the offender complies with the\nconditions imposed: see R. v. Brady (1998), 1998 ABCA 7 (CanLII), 121 C.C.C. (3d) 504 (Alta.\nC.A.); J.V. Roberts, “Conditional Sentencing: Sword of Damocles or Pandora’s\nBox?” (1997), 2 Can. Crim. L. Rev. 183.It also assists in\ndistinguishing the conditional sentence from probation by making the\nconsequences of a breach of condition more severe.[32]In general, as a sentence, a conditional\nsentence should be severe enough to contribute to respect for the law and the\nmaintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by achieving the sentencing\nobjectives of denouncing the offender’s unlawful conduct and acting as a\ndeterrence to others while at the same time respecting Parliament’s objective\nof addressing the overuse of incarceration as a sanction.While\na conditional sentence is only a partial restriction on liberty when compared\nto a term of imprisonment, a sentence of imprisonment is subject to reduction\nthrough parole, whereas a conditional sentence of equal duration is not.With this context, a sentencing judge should not be too quick\nto discount the value of a conditional sentence as an option in cases where\npublic safety does not require imprisonment.[33]While we are agreed that incarceration\nis warranted in this case, the circumstances are such that a conditional\nsentence is an appropriate and fit sentence; provided, however, that the\nduration of the sentence and the conditions imposed constitute a significant\nrestriction on the appellant’s liberty and, thereby, serve to denounce the\nappellant’s crime and to act as a deterrent to the appellant and to those\ninclined to break the law.[34]Given the foregoing factors and\nconsiderations, we concluded that a fit and proper sentence in\nthis case would be a conditional sentence of eight months incarceration to be\nserved in the community on and subject to the mandatory conditions set forth in\ns. 742.3(1) and the following optional conditions imposed pursuant to s.\n742.3(2):1.You must not possess and must abstain from the\nconsumption of alcohol, other intoxicating substances and drugs, except in\naccordance with a medical prescription.You shall not enter any premises\nlicensed to sell alcohol or alcoholic beverages.You shall submit to alcohol\nand drug testing, as and whenever directed to do so by the court, a peace\nofficer or your supervisor.2.You must reside only at 47 – 1600 Muzzy Drive,\nPrince Albert, Saskatchewan, and may move from this residence only upon your\nreceipt in advance of written permission to do so from your supervisor. You must\nremain continuously in your residence under house arrest and, except as\notherwise provided in this Order, you shall not leave your residence except to:a.attend at court;b.report in person to your supervisor;c.attend at your place of employment;d.attend an educational program approved by your\nsupervisor;e.perform community service as required by this\nOrder;f.attend counselling or assessment programs as\ndirected by your supervisor; org.receive medical or dental treatment with prior\nwritten permission from your supervisor;or as may be\notherwise permitted by this Order or by the court or your supervisor in\nwriting.When permitted to leave your residence, you must travel promptly and directly\nfrom your residence to the place that you are attending court, working, receiving\neducation, performing community service, receiving counselling or assessment\nservices, or receiving medical or dental treatment, and, after satisfying the\npurpose for your attendance at that place, you must return promptly and\ndirectly to your residence, in each case without any intermediate stops or\ninterruptions in your travel to and from your residence.3.You must promptly present yourself at the door\nof your residence if and whenever a peace officer or your supervisor attends to\nverify that you are complying with this Order.You must answer all telephone\ncalls from peace officers and your supervisor during the times you are required\nto remain in your residence and must not do anything that would prevent a peace\nofficer or your supervisor from verifying, by means of a telephone call, that\nyou are within your residence.4.You must perform 50 hours of community service,\nas approved by your supervisor, over the period of this Order.5.You shall attend at and cooperate in alcohol- or\nsubstance-abuse counselling or assessment programs as may be directed by your\nsupervisor.If you are directed to attend a program at a residential treatment\nfacility, you shall not provide any cause for your removal from the program or\nthe facility.6.You shall immediately advise any peace officer\nwith whom you have dealings that you are subject to a conditional sentence\norder.You must carry a copy of this Order, and any written permission to\nleave your residence, with you at all times.You must, upon demand, present\nthis Order and any written permissions from your supervisor to any peace\nofficer or other individual responsible for the enforcement of this Order. You\nshall, upon demand, permit any peace officer to search (with or without\nreasonable grounds or a search warrant) your person or any vehicle you own,\nhave registered in your name or are found operating.[35]As required pursuant to s. 742.3(3)(b),\nwe explained the substance of ss. 742.3(1), 742.4 and 742.6 to the appellant\nwhile he was before us in court. The appellant acknowledged that he understood\nthe order and our explanations.[36]We hereby direct counsel for the\nappellant to provide the appellant with a copy of his conditional sentence\norder and to explain to him the procedure for applying under s. 742.4 for a\nchange to the optional conditions of his conditional sentence order."}

The victim is her daughter.[2]For a complete understanding of the relationship\nbetween the victim and her mother, the atmosphere in their family and the\nevents surrounding the offence, the Court refers to its judgment on verdict.[3]Before the offence, relations between the victim\nand Mrs Kaleki were always good.[4]In the days preceding the offence, for the first\ntime in her young life, the victim went to nightclubs. She stayed out two\nnights in a row. Because of her past, Mrs Kaleki is a worrier. She was\nconcerned about the safety of her daughter. The first night, Mrs Kaleki called\nher daughter on numerous occasions. She went to the victim’s friend’s domicile\nto look for her daughter. She even went with her husband to the police station\nto report her daughter missing. On the second night, her husband made up a\nstory that their daughter went out with his permission in order to calm Mrs\nKaleki. His story did not appease Mrs Kaleki.[5]When her daughter came home early in the\nmorning, Mrs Kaleki asked her husband to be alone with their daughter.[6]Mrs Kaleki used a cleaver, wounded the victim on\nthe nape of her neck and then struck again. The victim was seriously injured.\nAs the victim tried to leave the family home, Mrs Kaleki tried to choke her.The victim[7]The victim was nineteen years old when the\noffence was committed.[8]In 2010, she signed a victim impact statement[1]. She also testified on\nsentence.[9]She suffered injuries which required surgery.\nTendons of her right hand were cut. Stitches were needed for a wound behind her\nright ear. She was hospitalized for eleven days. For a certain period of time,\nshe suffered from a partial disability of her hand and received two or three\nsessions of physiotherapy treatments. For a certain time also, she suffered\nfrom anxiety. She is now completely healed, physically and mentally.[10]The victim got married during the proceedings.\nMrs Kaleki organized the wedding. The victim is not with her husband anymore.\nShe was welcomed back by her parents who helped her through this situation. She\nmoved back to her parents’ domicile. She is now living with Mrs Kaleki.[11]Her parents encouraged her to pursue her\neducation. She has now secured full time employment.[12]In her testimony, the victim says that her\nmother, although she does not show any memory of the event, is sorry for what\nhappened and shows remorse. Her mother is the sweetest person she knows.Her\nmother has always respected her bail conditions. She has never witnessed any\nviolent or aggressive behaviour from her mother since the event. She feels\nabsolutely no fear of her. Her mother is not a danger to anyone. She loves her\nmother. Their relationship is even better today than it was before the event.[13]The victim also gives her opinion on sentence:\nher mother does not deserve to go to jail. The victim adds that she is\ndevastated thinking that her mother could go to prison. She is the rock of the\nfamily. Nobody can take her place. Her youngest sister, who is eleven years\nold, would be heartbroken if their mother were to be sentenced to jail.[14]The victim also says that she did not press\ncharges against her mother and did not receive any pressure to testify.The accused[15]Mrs Kaleki is forty-four years old. At the time\nof the event, she was thirty-eight years old.[16]She has been married to Mr Ebrahim Ebrahimi for\ntwenty-seven years. They have four daughters. The victim is the eldest.[17]She does not work outside the house. She takes\ncare of the children and the household. She is a devoted mother.[18]She has no previous convictions.[19]She was arrested on the premises on June 13,\n2010. She was released under conditions on August 19, 2010. She was kept in\ncustody for sixty-seven days.[20]There is no evidence of any failure to comply\nwith the bail conditions.[21]Mrs Kaleki’s sister and brother wrote letters[2] vouching for her good\ncharacter as a human being and a mother.[22]A close friend of Mrs Kaleki tells the Court that\nMrs Kaleki is a loving and caring person, well respected in the community. She\nis also a good mother. Mrs Kaleki helped her to establish herself in Montréal\nwhen she arrived thirteen years ago. Mrs Kaleki looked after her son, even\nafter the event.[23]Mr Ebrahimi testifies again on sentence. Mrs\nKaleki runs their house. Three of their children are still living with their\nparents. Two are adults. The youngest has a very close relationship with her\nmother. She worries a lot about what could happen to her mother.[24]Mr Ebrahimi is still looking for answers\nconcerning the event. The woman he saw on that day is not his wife as he knows\nher. Without any doubt, Mr Ebrahimi feels that his wife does not represent a\ndanger to anyone.[25]In June 2010, the Director of Youth Protection became\ninvolved in the situation of the three other children of the family. After Mrs\nKaleki’s release on bail, the Director arranged and supervised the visitation\nbetween these children and Mrs Kaleki. On August 21, 2010, the Director decided\nthat, given the evolution of the family situation and the assessment of the\nchildren’s needs, the children were not in danger and that youth protection\nservices were no longer necessary[3].POSITION OF THE PARTIES[26]The prosecution seeks a period of incarceration\nof ten years.[27]The defence submits that a suspended sentence\nwould be appropriate given the particular circumstances of this case.THE LAW[28]The fundamental purpose of sentencing is to protect\nsociety and to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect\nfor the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society[4].[29]This purpose is met by the imposition of just\nsanctions that reflect the sentencing objectives: denunciation, general and\nspecific deterrence, separation of offenders from society, rehabilitation,\nreparation, promotion of a sense of responsibility in the offender and\nacknowledgment of the harm caused to the victim and to the community[5].[30]A sentence must be proportionate to the gravity\nof the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender[6].[31]A court that imposes a sentence shall take into\nconsideration the relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to\nthe offence or the offender[7].[32]A sentence should be similar to sentences\nimposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar\ncircumstances[8].[33]Proportionality is determined both on an\nindividual basis, that is, in relation to the accused and to the offence\ncommitted by the accused, and by comparison with sentences imposed for similar\noffences committed in similar circumstances. Individualization and parity of\nsentences must be reconciled for a sentence to be proportionate[9].[34]Proportionality requires\nthat a sentence not exceed\nwhat is just and appropriate, given the moral blameworthiness of the offender\nand the gravity of the offence. In this sense, the principle serves a limiting\nor restraining function. It also seeks to ensure that offenders are held\nresponsible for their actions and that the sentence properly reflects and\ncondemns their role in the offence and the harm they caused. The two\nperspectives on proportionality thus converge in a sentence that both speaks\nout against the offence and punishes the offender no more than is necessary[10].[35]General ranges of sentences\nfor particular offences encourage greater consistency between sentencing\ndecisions in accordance with the principle of parity.But these ranges are guidelines rather than hard and fast rules. A\njudge can order a sentence outside the range as long as it is in accordance\nwith the principles and objectives of sentencing[11].[36]The determination of a just and appropriate\nsentence is a highly individualized exercise that goes beyond a purely\nmathematical calculation. It involves a variety of factors that are difficult\nto define with precision. Everything depends on the gravity of the offence, the\noffender’s degree of responsibility and the specific circumstances of each case[12].[37]The offence of attempt to commit murder is\namongst the most serious offences. Every person who attempts to commit murder\nis liable to imprisonment for life[13].[38]In Roy v. R.[14], the Quebec Court of Appeal\nstudied the range of sentences for the offence of attempt to commit murder in\nthe context of domestic violence. Their study outlines three categories :1-sentences ofless than seven years, mostly\nvarying from four to six years, in cases in which rehabilitation is foreseeable\nor circumstances such as a guilty plea, no prior convictions or less severe\nconsequences are present[15];2- sentences from eight to fourteen years in cases in\nwhich there is the use of firearms, previous violence, psychological problems,\nparticular brutality or serious consequences;3- sentences over fifteen years in cases where\naggravating circumstances are present such as repetitive violence, previous\nthreats, harassment, planning, extreme brutality, absence of remorse or risk of\nre-offence.[39]In R. v. Martin[16], the Court of Appeal\ndiscussed a range of sentences for attempted murder offences varying from\neighteen months to eight years. Even in cases concerning accused with serious\nmental problems, the sentence should not be lower than one year[17].ANALYSIS[40]Mrs Kaleki is a beloved woman and a devoted\nmother. The offence is totally out of character.[41]The assault on the victim was violent. Her\nfather, most probably, saved her life.[42]We can find explanations for Mrs Kaleki’s\nbehaviour in the testimony of Dr Watts, particularly in the following extracts:- it’s explained by the context of her upset and distress at being\nconfronted with her daughter […] who’s (sic)behaviors had escalated in a very short\nperiod of time […].- […] her husband was upset and she had never seen him this\nupset and she kept a lot of these difficulties from him […].- in a sense that it’s consistent with an anger motive. It’s consistent\nwith a boiling over, a frustration at the situation […].[18][43]These explanations are consistent with Mrs\nKaleki’s statement to Mr Bertand after her arrest[19]:Detective-Sergeant Alex Bertrand:Okay, I think … I think that something snapped. And, you know, that’s\nwhy I asked you some questions regarding your values and all that, because I\nwant to understand, because I frankly have a hard time understanding all this.\nI have all my opinions, you know … you know … is it that, you know, something\nsnapped and you lost control?Johra Kaleki:Yes, I did.[44]Mrs Kaleki’s intention was\nto kill the victim. Consequently, her moral\nblameworthiness is significant.Mitigating\ncircumstances[45]Amongst the mitigating circumstances are the\nfacts that Mrs Kaleki has the support of her family, has no previous\nconvictions, has no history of violence, has not committed another offence\nsince and that the risk of re-offence is almost non existent.[46]The offender's remorse and regret clearly are\nmitigating factors[20].\nMrs Kalekihad expressed regret to the victim and shown remorse.[47]Compliance with bail\nconditions for a certain period of time prior to sentence may constitute a\nmitigating circumstance[21].\nMrs Kaleki was arrested on the\npremises following the assault on June 13, 2010, some five years and eight\nmonths ago. She was released on bail on August 19, 2010. Since that day, she\nhas been required to comply with conditions set forth in an undertaking. During\nthat period, she was unable to visit members of her family in Saudi Arabia and\na close friend in the United States.She was not able to visit another of her\ndaughters who has also lived in the United States since her marriage in\nSeptember 2015. During the same period, her contacts with her children were\nsupervised, although the conditions were modified over time to be less\ndemanding.This should be taken into account.[48]Although publicity is an\nordinary occurrence in our justice system and for the offender being\nstigmatized is an inevitable feature of the criminal justice process, adverse publicity can\nbe a mitigating factor[22].\nMedia articles concerning the case were produced[23]. Many refer to\nan “honour crime”. Mr Ebrahimi testified concerning the impact on his family of\nbeing associated with such a crime. Obviously, a mother attacking her daughter\nwith a cleaver will catch public attention. It is difficult to evaluate the\nimpact of such a label, but we can assume that there was some negative effect\non Mrs Kaleki and her family.[49]The victim is now living\nwith her mother at the family residence. She says that their relationship has\nnever been better. She forgives her mother and asks for clemency.An adult\nvictim's act of forgiveness is a relevant mitigating factor[24]. However, in\nany case in which a victim argues for a lesser sentence, the Court must be\nalert to the possibility that the victim is being pressured by the accused or\nothers to take such a position, and this is a particular concern where the\nvictim is a member of the accused’s family[25].In the present case, no such pressure seems to exist.[50]Nevertheless, considering\nthat sentencing an accused has a societal purpose which goes beyond the victim\nand the accused, the opinion of the victim on sentence does not discharge the\nCourt from the responsibility of determining the appropriate sentence[26].Aggravating\ncircumstances[51]The fact that the victim is Mrs Kaleki’s\ndaughter[27]\nand the use of a weapon, more than once, are aggravating circumstances.[52]The assault was not premeditated but it was not\na spontaneous reaction on the spur of the moment:Mrs Kaleki went upstairs to\nget the knife, she hid it under her t-shirt, she asked her husband to leave\nthem alone and she closed the door. She then abused her position of trust by\nkissing her daughter and asking her to fall asleep[28]. Even after being stopped\nby her husband, she chased the victim and tried to choke her.[53]The fact that, without the father’s\nintervention, the injuries suffered by the victim would probably have been more\nserious[29]\ncannot be considered as an aggravating circumstance.Conclusions[54]The prosecution insists on two cases to support\nits position: R. v. Postma[30]\nand R. v. Nabavi[31].[55]In Postma, the physical, emotional and\npsychological impacts on the victim were devastating to all aspects of her life,\nthe accused discarded incriminating evidence and there was no evidence to\nproperly assess the ongoing risk the accused posed to the public. Mrs Kaleki’s\ndaughter is now completely healed and Mrs Kaleki poses no risk to the public.\nMore significantly, the victim and Mrs Kaleki are now living together.[56]In Nabavi, the attack was premeditated,\nthe victim suffered extremely serious injuries with lasting consequences, the\nvictim and her daughter suffered serious psychological harm. The consequences\nin this case are not comparable to the present case.[57]The defence insists on Mrs Kaleki’s amnesia and\nher altered state of mind at the moment of the offence. On those issues, this\nCourt refers to the judgment on verdict: the brain was then recording and Mrs\nKaleki was not suffering from any mental illness.Mrs Kaleki’s state of mind\nat the time was similar to frustration, anger and rage. Still, it was totally\nout of character. This rage impaired her judgment.[58]The defence refers to decisions concerning the\noffence of manslaughter. The relevancy of these decisions is limited since, in\nthese cases, the accused has no intent to kill contrary to the offence of\nattempt to commit murder. The level of the offender’s moral blameworthiness is\nnot the same. Mr Justice Lamer of the Supreme Court of Canada wrote in R. v.\nLogan[32]:The\nstigma associated with a conviction for attempted murder is the same as it is\nfor murder. Such a conviction reveals that although no death ensued from the\nactions of the accused, the intent to kill was still present in his or her\nmind. The attempted murderer is no less a killer than a murderer: he may be\nlucky — the ambulance arrived early, or some other fortuitous circumstance —\nbut he still has the same killer instinct. Secondly, while a\nconviction for attempted murder does not automatically result in a life\nsentence, the offence is punishable by life and the usual penalty is very\nsevere.[59]The severity of a sentence depends not only on\nthe seriousness of the crime’s consequences, but also on the moral\nblameworthiness of the offender[33].[60]Without ignoring the other objectives,\ndenunciation and deterrence are paramount in cases of attempted murder.[61]In R. v. C.A.M., the Supreme Court\nof Canada said about denunciation:The objective of denunciation mandates that a sentence should also\ncommunicate society's condemnation of that particular offender's conduct. In\nshort, a sentence with a denunciatory element represents a symbolic, collective\nstatement that the offender's conduct should be punished for encroaching on our\nsociety's basic code of values as enshrined within our substantive criminal\nlaw.[34][62]Specific deterrence may notbe necessary to\nprevent Mrs Kaleki from re-offending,but general deterrence, using sentencing\nto send a message to discourage others from offending,is relevant.[63]While it is normal for trial judges to consider\nsentences other than imprisonment in appropriate cases, in the present case, as\nin all cases in which general or specific deterrence and denunciation must be\nemphasized, the courts have very few options other than imprisonment for\nmeeting these objectives, which are essential to the maintenance of a just,\npeaceful and law‑abiding society[35].[64]Even where a term of imprisonment is necessary,\nit should be the lightest possible sanction in the circumstances.[65]A term of imprisonment will unfortunately\ndeprive the younger daughter of her mother. This is not exceptional.\nFortunately this young girl can count on the support of her father and two\nadult sisters who are living with her.[66]In R. v. Boutin[36], the Quebec Court of Appeal\nvaried, from nine years to five years, the sentence of the accused who pleaded\nguilty to a charge of attempted murder. The accused had served four months of\npre-sentence custody. Suffering from alcoholism, jealousy and depression, the\naccused stabbed his wife who intented to divorce him. The physical intervention\nof the accused’s teenager saved the life of the victim. After the tragedy, the\naccused behaved well and improved his attitude. Since the accused seemed determined\nto succeed in his rehabilitation, the severity of the sentence imposed by the\ntrial judge would have discouraged him in his efforts.[67]Considering the gravity of the offence, all the\ncircumstances, including the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, and the\nfact that Mrs Kaleki poses little or no risk to society, a sentence of three\nyears is appropriate.[68]The time spent in pre-sentence custody,\nsixty-seven days, should be taken into account[37].A credit of one hundred days is accorded to Mrs Kaleki[38].For these reasons, the Court :CONDEMNS Mrs Johra Kaleki to\nimprisonment for a term of two years and two hundred sixty-five days;PROHIBITS Mrs Kaleki from possessing any\nprohibited firearm, restricted firearm, prohibited weapon, prohibited device,\nprohibited ammunition for life and from possessing any other firearm, crossbow,\nrestricted weapon, ammunition and explosive substance for a period of ten years\nafter her release from imprisonment;AUTHORIZES the taking of the number of\nsamples of bodily substances that is reasonably required for the purpose of\nforensic DNA analysis from Mrs Kaleki;DISPENSESMrs Kaleki from paying the\nvictim surcharge.__________________________________Yves Paradis, J.C.Q.Me Anne GauvinFor the prosecutionMe Isabel J.

Heath, for the Respondent)Respondent))- and -)))DAMIAN FERRIE)))Mr. Richard Posner, for the Appellant)Appellant))))HEARD:March 21, 2005Bracebridge, ONREASONS FOR\nJUDGMENTSHAUGHNESSY, RSJ.[1]The\nAppellant, Damian Ferrie appeals against the sentence imposed by Mr. Justice\nEvans on January 27, 2003.The Appellant plead guilty to three charges under\nthe Controlled Drugs and Substance Act.He was convicted of possession\nof ecstasy, psilocybin and marihuana contrary to ss. 4 (1) and 4 (5) of the Act.[2]The Crown\nconsents to the appeal against conviction with respect to possession of\nmarihuana and accordingly, an acquittal will be substituted in relation to the\ncharge of possession of marihuana and the sentence quashed on that charge.[3]The\nsentencing judge imposed a fine of $1,000 and the appellant was further ordered\nto pay the victim fine surcharge in the amount of $100.[4]The\nAppellant appeals against the sentence imposed by the Trial Judge.The issues\non this appeal are:(i)Was the sentence imposed by Evans J.\nunreasonable in that it was harsh and excessive?(ii)Did the Trial Judge fail to give adequate\nReasons for his decision?[5]In the\ncircumstances detailed above, the appellant maintains that the Trial Judge\nerrored and he failed to give any adequate Reasons why a conditional discharge\nwas inappropriate.BACKGROUND INFORMATION[6]On August\n3, 2002, the Appellant was visiting friends in Barrie.The Appellant and a\nnumber of other individuals traveled in the Appellant’s vehicle to the town of\nGravenhurst.The car was parked in the parking lot of Camp Shalom, a\nchildren’s summer camp.[7]The\nAppellant was aware that there was marihuana and psilocybin in his car and he\nwas also aware that there were ecstasy tablets wrapped in tin foil located in\nthe vehicle.Police Officers attended at the scene and eventually arrested the\nAppellant.[8]The\nAppellant has no criminal record and he entered a plea to all 3 charges on\nJanuary 7, 2003, which was at a relatively early point of time.[9]At the\nsentencing hearing, defense counsel submitted that the accused should receive a\nconditional discharge.TRIAL JUDGE’S REASONS FOR SENTENCE[10]The Trial Judge, in his Reasons\nfor Sentence indicates that he “gave very serious consideration to the\ndischarge provisions of the Criminal Code”.The Trial Judge goes on to\nstate that while it may be in the best interests of this offender to grant a\nconditional discharge, nevertheless, he was not persuaded that it “would be in\nthe public interest in all these circumstances to grant a discharge”.The\nTrial Judge then stated that with respect to the possession of ecstasy there\nwould be a fine in the amount of $400 and a victim fine surcharge in the amount\nof $40.On the possession of the psilocybin, there was also a fine of $400 and\na victim fine surcharge of $40.The possession of marihuana also attracted a\nfine.POSITION OF THE DEFENSE ON THIS APPEAL[11]Counsel for the Appellant submits\nthat the offender should receive a conditional discharge.It is submitted that\nthe Appellant has experienced shame and remorse for his involvement in this\noffense.It is further submitted that Appellant’s good character and the fact\nthat he had no prior criminal record are factors favouring a conditional\ndischarge.Further, counsel submits that there was an absence of any\nmaliciousness on the part of the Appellant in the commission of the offence.If anything, it is suggested that the Appellant demonstrated a series of poor\njudgment calls in relation to these offences.[12]It is further submitted by the\nDefense that a conditional discharge was an appropriate disposition which the\nSentencing Judge ought to have imposed by reason of the implications that a\ncriminal conviction has on the career of the Appellant.Counsel for the\nAppellant states that the Appellant is a registered massage therapist and in\norder to practice in that profession, he is obligated under the Massage\nTherapy Act, 1991, Ontario Regulation 864/93, Amended to O. Reg. 473/99 to\nreport any convictions.Therefore, it is the position of the Appellant that\nalternative measurers were available to the Court that would have the same\neffect of denouncing unlawful conduct, but would not be unduly harsh.[13]The Appellant further submits that\nthe Reasons for Sentence of the Trial Judge are insufficient and do not amount\nto a reasoned decision as they fail to address the most important issues raised\nby the defense.ANALYSIS[14]At the outset, it is apparent that\nthe issues raised on this appeal (with the exception of the adequacy of the\nReasons for Sentencing of the Trial Judge), are the very same matters that were\nargued before the Trial Judge.[15]Further, in the course of\nsubmissions, defense counsel cited supporting case law and referred\nspecifically to numerous cases where a conditional discharge was determined to\nbe an appropriate disposition, (including R. v. Balaski, [1995] O.J. No.\n3937; R. v. Caffrey, [1988], O.J. No. 1609; R. v. Schulhauser, 45\nW.C.B. (2d) 331; R. v. Hayes, [1999] O.J. 938).[16]I find that the Trial Judge in his\nReasons for Sentencing “gave very serious consideration” to the defense\nsubmission for a conditional discharge.The Trial Judge nevertheless rejected\nthis proposed disposition because on balance, it would not be in the “public\ninterest”.The Statement of Facts which the offender agreed are substantially\ncorrect detail that:(a)The accused was the operator of a motor vehicle\nwhich was parked in a parking lot of a children’s camp near the Town of\nGravenhurst in mid-summer when the camp was fully operational;(b)The summer camp personnel notified the Ontario\nProvincial Police that a number of young people were observed to be drinking in\na vehicle;(c)The police attended at the parking lot and\nobserved that the parked vehicle had its windows down and open beer cans were\nobserved in the car.The police officers opened the centre console apparently\nto locate registration particulars for the vehicle.In the console, there were\nobserved two baggies.The first baggy held 2.7 grams of psilocybin (also known\nas magic mushrooms).The second bag had 1 gram of marihuana.[17]The police then conducted a search\nof the surrounding area.They located 7 young people on a cliff that overlooks\nLake Muskoka.The accused apparently left the other individuals andmade an\nattempt to flee the area.In the course of doing so, the Appellant was\nobserved by Ontario Provincial Police Officers to be attempting to discard a\npackage.This package was recovered and it consisted of 4 tablets (1.1 grams)\nof what is commonly referred to as Ecstasy.[18]Accordingly, there are a number of\naggravating factors, including the place of the commission of this offense,\ncombined with the reality that both ecstasy and psilocybin are very dangerous\ndrugs that can result in death or serious physical or emotional harm to users.[19]I find that there is ample\njustification for imposing a fine and a resulting criminal record when weighing\nthe interest of the accused and the interest of the community.It is apparent\nfrom the Reasons of the Sentencing Judge that the principle of denunciation\ncould not be achieved without the imposition of a fine and a criminal record.[20]The issue here is not whether the\nSummary Conviction Appeal Judge would impose a different sentence, but whether\nthe Trial Judge errored in the circumstances.I find that the facts and\ncircumstances of the incident and the resulting sentence do not\ndemonstrate any error in fact or law on the part of the Sentencing Judge.The\nimpact that a conviction may have on the career of the Appellant is a factor\nthat was presented to the Sentencing Judge for his consideration.The Judge\nindicated that he carefully considered the request for a conditional discharge,\nhowever, he rejected the submission.There were sufficient reasons for\nrejecting a conditional discharge having regard to the public interest.It\ncannot be said that the sentence imposed by the Sentencing Judge was outside\nthe accepted parameters for this type of offense.WERE THE REASONS OF THE SENTENCING JUDGE ADEQUATE?[21]Admittedly, it would have been\npreferable if the Sentencing Judge had provided detailed Reasons for the\nsentence imposed with reference to the principles of sentencing as detailed in\nthe Criminal Code.[22]In Regina v. Sheppard\n2002 SCC 26 (CanLII), [2002], 1 S.C.R. 869, the Supreme Court of Canada states that the delivery of\nreasoned decisions is inherent in the Trial Judge’s role.Accordingly, an\naccused should not be left in doubt about why a conviction has been entered and\na sentence imposed.However, the Supreme Court states that the statutory right\nof appeal is directed at the result rather than at the reason for the result.Accordingly, not every failure or deficiency in the reasons will provide a\nground of appeal.Mr. Justice Binnie in R. v. Sheppard (para 25)\ndetails a functional test that must be applied in reviewing the Reasons for\nJudgment.If deficiencies in the Reasons do not, in\na particular case, foreclose meaningful appellate review, but allow for its\nfull exercise, the deficiency will not justify intervention under s. 686 of the\nCriminal Code.That provision limits the power of the appellate court\nto intervene to situations where it is of the opinion that (i) the verdict is\nunreasonable, (ii) the judgment is vitiated by an error of law and it cannot be\nsaid that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred or (iii)\non any ground where there has been a miscarriage of justice.[23]As Justice Binnie stated in R.\nv. Sheppard, the appellate court is “not given the power to intervene\nsimply because it thinks that the trial court did a poor job of expressing\nitself” (para 26).Therefore, the Trial Judge’s duty is satisfied by Reasons\nthat are sufficient to serve the purpose for which the duty is imposed, namely,\na decision which, having regard to the circumstances of the case, is reasonably\nintelligible to the litigants and provides the basis for meaningful appellate\nreview.[24]Finally, I take particular note of\nJustice Binnie’s comments in relation to “error of law” cases where he states\n(para 46)…..the duty to give reasons, where it\nexists, arises out of the circumstances of a particular case.Where it is\nplain from the record why an accused has been convicted or acquitted, and the\nabsence or inadequacy of reasons provides no significant impediment to the\nexercise of a right of appeal, the appeal court will not on that account\nintervene.On the other hand, where the path taken by the trial judge through\nconfused or conflicting evidence is not at all apparent, or there are difficult\nissues of law that need to be confronted, but which the trial judge has\ncircumnavigated without explanation, or where….there are conflicting theories\nfor why the trial judge might have decided as he or she did, at least some of\nwhich would clearly constitutereversible error, the appeal court may in some cases consider itself unable to give\neffect to the statutory right of appeal.In such a case, one or other of the\nparties may question the correctness of the result, but will wrongly have been\ndeprived by the absence or inadequacy of reasons of the opportunity to have the\ntrial verdict properly scrutinized on appeal.In such a case, even if the\nrecord discloses evidence that on one view could support a reasonable verdict,\nthe deficiencies in the reasons may amount to an error of law and justify\nappellate intervention.It will be for the appeal court to determine whether,\nin a particular case the deficiency in the reasons precludes it from properly\ncarrying out its appellate function.[25]I find in the present case that\nthere were two proposed dispositions for the offender.The Crown sought a fine\n(with a resulting criminal record) and the defense sought a conditional\ndischarge.The reasons indicate that the Sentencing Judge considered a\nconditional discharge, but ultimately rejected it as an appropriate\ndisposition.The record before the Court indicates that the same arguments\npresented on this Appeal were also advanced before the Sentencing Judge.While\nthe reasons of the Sentencing Judge might be described as minimal at best,\nnevertheless, it is plain from the record why the accused was given the\nsentence and the absence or inadequacy of the Reasons do not provide any\nsignificant impediment to the exercise of a meaningful appellate review.I\nfind that the sentence imposed is reasonable and there was no error at law and\nthere are no grounds to suggest that there has been a miscarriage of justice.[26]Further, while the Reasons of the\nSentencing Judge may be characterized as scant, nevertheless, the Reasons, in\nthe circumstances of this case, as disclosed in the record leaves no doubt why\nthe sentence was imposed.Further, while counsel for the Appellant has referred\nto a number of decisions where a conditional discharge was imposed,\nnevertheless, it cannot be said that the sentence imposed in this matter was\nunreasonable, an error at law, or is a miscarriage of justice.Due deference\nmust be given to the Sentencing Judge in the circumstances.[27]Accordingly, this Appeal is\ndismissed.___________________________SHAUGHNESSY RSJ.Released:April\n14, 2005"}

Armstrong and Juriansz JJ.A.April 23, 2012Criminal law -- Sentencing -- Long-term offenders -- Breach of long-term supervision order -- Pre-trial custody -- Accused sentenced to three years' imprisonment on two breaches of long- term supervision order (\"LTSO\") -- Judge intending to credit accused 1.5 days' credit for pre-sentence incarceration but calculation error resulting in accused receiving 228 days less credit than judge intended to -- Accused having served entire custodial period of sentence seeking reduction of LTSO reduced by 228 days -- Appeal dismissed -- LTSO ran during pre-sentence custody for breaches of order and appropriate that less credit being given for pre-sentence custody while LTSO in effect -- Sentence actually imposed being fit -- Appeal dismissed.The accused was convicted in 2003 of sexual assault and other offences. He was designated as a long-term offender and was sentenced to five years' incarceration. A seven-year long-term supervision order (\"LTSO\") was imposed. In 2010, the accused was convicted of two counts of breaching his LTSO. The sentencing judge sentenced him to two years' imprisonment for the first breach and one-year consecutive for the second breach. The sentencing judge intended to give the accused a credit of 1.5 days for each day in pre-sentence custody. Due to a calculation error, the accused was granted a credit of 228 days less than he otherwise would have received. The accused appealed. He was now out of custody and sought to have the 228 days applied to reduce the length of his LTSO.Held, the appeal should be dismissed.Despite the sentencing judge's factual mistake in granting the accused less credit for pre-sentence custody than he apparently intended to, the sentence actually imposed was fit. The sentencing judge noted that the accused had never completed any of the treatment programs he had started, that he did not take supervision seriously and that the risk to the public remained high. The time a long-term offender spends in pre- sentence custody cannot be regarded as \"dead time\", as the LTSO continues to run until conviction. The rationale for a seven-year LTSO was not undermined by the sentencing judge's calculation error.APPEAL by the accused from the sentence imposed by Turnbull J. of the Superior Court of Justice on March 1, 2011.

Statutes referred to Corrections and Conditional Release Act, S.C. 1992, c. 20, s.135(2) [as am.]\nJulie Santarossa, for appellant.Nadia Thomas, for respondent.The judgment of the court was delivered by[1] JURIANSZ J.A.: -- In June 2004, the appellant wasdesignated as a long-term offender (\"LTO\") and sentenced to along-term supervision order (\"LTSO\"). The order was, at thetime of sentencing, anticipated to continue to April 28, 2013.He appeals his sentence, relying on an error made by thesentencing judge in calculating his credit for pre-sentencecustody. As he was released from imprisonment on September 26,2011 on statutory release, he seeks to reduce the duration ofthe LTSO.[2] On August 23, 2010, the appellant was convicted of twocounts of breaching his LTSO. On March 1, 2011, he wassentenced to two years' imprisonment for the first breach andto one year in custody for the second breach, to be servedconsecutively. The sentencing judge stated he would be givencredit of 1.5 days for each day in \"pre-trial\" custody andcalculated that credit to be 781 days premised on the 521-dayperiod between the date of his arrest, April 28, 2009, andOctober 21, 2010. The selection of October 21, 2010 is notexplained. The appellant was convicted on August 23, 2010 andsentenced on March 1, 2011. In his reasons, the sentencingjudge stated that the appellant was found guilty on October 1,2010, but the indictment reflects that a new pre-sentencereport was ordered on that date. The appellant did not appearin court on October 21, 2010.[3] The parties agree that the sentencing judge intended togive the appellant 1.5-to-1 credit for his pre-sentencecustody. His pre-sentence custody amounts to 673 days,beginning with his arrest on April 28, 2009 and ending on March1, 2011, when he was sentenced. The proper credit calculated atthe rate of 1.5-to-1 would amount to a credit of 1,009 days.Thus, the sentencing judge granted the appellant 228 days(about 7[cents] months) less credit than he might haveotherwise received.[4] Relying on this error, the appellant, who is now out ofcustody, seeks to have the credit the judge intended to givehim applied to reduce the length of the LTSO that he iscurrently serving. If his sentence is reduced, the appellant'sLTSO, which was suspended while he served his sentence, wouldrecommence earlier and expire earlier.[5] I would grant leave to appeal his sentence, but dismissthe appeal. Notwithstanding the sentencing judge's error, Iwould not disturb the sentence he imposed. The sentenceactually imposed was fit. [page170][6] The appellant was convicted on December 1, 2003 of twocounts of sexual assault on victims he had rendered unconsciouswith a stupefying drug, one count of administering a stupefyingdrug with intent to commit sexual assault and one count ofunlawful possession of property. The offences occurred between1999 and 2003 in North Bay and involved three differentvictims. He drugged the three victims with drinks referred toas \"paralyzers\". He had sexual intercourse with the first andsecond victims after drugging them. The second victim was thewife of a friend. He drugged her while she was at work. Thethird victim was his downstairs neighbour. She had no clearmemory of the events until admitted to hospital. He had drilledholes in her apartment so he could observe her in her bedroom.For these offences, the appellant was sentenced to five years'incarceration less pre-trial custody at a 2-for-1 ratio andmade subject to a long-term supervision order for a period ofseven years following his release.[7] The long-term supervision order began to run on November9, 2005, when the appellant was released to a community carecentre, and was initially anticipated to end seven years later,on November 8, 2012. However, as the sentencing judge noted, heimmediately embarked on a course of infractions.[8] On December 1, 2005, a suspension warrant was issued andexecuted when he was found to be accessing pornography andescort service websites as well as chat rooms. The NationalParole Board of Canada issued a reprimand on January 27, 2006and returned him to the community care centre on January 30,2006.[9] Less than two months later, on March 20, 2006, a secondsuspension warrant was issued and executed when the appellantwas alleged to have had contact with another resident'sgirlfriend. He was returned to the community care centre onApril 19, 2006.[10] On May 8, 2006, the third suspension warrant was issuedand executed because the appellant was found to have violatedthe condition that he have no contact with females withoutprior authorization from his parole supervisor. He was againreleased to community care on August 15, 2006.[11] The fourth suspension warrant was issued and executed onSeptember 26, 2006, when he failed to provide detailed billingfor his cellphone charges. As well, he had failed to discloseto his parole supervisor that he had been on a trip to NorthBay in the presence of a 17-year-old female and had rented ahotel room for her. He was charged with breaching his long-termsupervision order on November 23, 2007. [page171][12] He was sentenced for that breach on July 2, 2008. Hereceived a sentence of four years' incarceration less creditfor 644 days of pre-trial custody at a ratio of 2-to-1.[13] He was released on statutory release on October 23, 2008and reached his warrant expiry on December 20, 2008, when hislong-term supervision order recommenced with a condition thathe reside at a community care centre.[14] Shortly after, on February 2, 2009, a fifth suspensionwarrant was issued and executed when the appellant was found inpossession of a computer capable of accessing the Internet anda CD containing pornographic images of young women. On April28, 2009, he was charged with the two counts of breaching hisLTSO in this case.[15] In his reasons, the sentencing judge noted that theappellant had never completed any of the treatment programs hehad started and that the risk he posed to the public remained\"high\". He did not take supervision seriously and blamedothers continuously for his circumstances and did not acceptresponsibility for his actions.[16] The appellant's effective sentence on these two countswas ten and one-half months' incarceration, given the 781 daysof credit he received. As noted, he was released six and one-half months later on September 26, 2011. His LTSO, which wassuspended during his sentence, recommenced at his warrantexpiry on January 12, 2012. If his appeal is successful, itwould end some seven and one-half months earlier than it iscurrently set to expire.[17] I agree with the Crown's submission that it should bekept in mind that the time a long-term offender spends in pre-sentence custody cannot be regarded as \"dead time\", as theLTSO continues to run until conviction. As Justice Masse put itin R. v. Nelson, [2007] O.J. No. 5704, 2007 Carswell 9456(C.J.), at paras. 30-31:[A]lthough the long-term supervision order is interruptedwhile an offender serves a sentence, it continues to rununtil such time as sentence is actually pronounced. It wouldbe an anomalous result for an offender to receive both acredit towards his long-term supervision order for pre-sentence custody as well as an enhanced credit towardssentence. That could not have been the intention ofParliament.[18] The issue has been considered by this court in oneprevious case, R. v. Ipeelee (2009), 2009 ONCA 892 (CanLII), 99 O.R. (3d) 419, [2009]O.J. No. 5402 (C.A.), at para. 10 (appeal allowed on othergrounds [2012] S.C.J. No. 13, 2012 SCC 13 (CanLII)), where the courtsaid: [page172]Did the sentencing judge err by refusing enhanced credit?The sentencing judge refused to give the appellant enhancedcredit for the six months he spent in pre-sentence custody.In the circumstance of this case, I see no error. As thesentencing judge noted, the time under the long-termsupervision order continues to run while the offender is inpre-sentence custody for breach of a condition of the order.Moreover, the lack of credit for time served towards earlyrelease, a factor usually cited as a reason for enhancedcredit, is less relevant here as the appellant is unlikely tobe granted early release.[19] One goal of an LTSO to rehabilitate offenders andreintegrate them into the community by supervising them afterthey are released from imprisonment. If the offender is incustody awaiting trial on charges of breaching the LTSO,nothing can be accomplished towards reintegrating the offenderinto the community. Some rehabilitation is possible becauselong-term offenders, unlike other accused persons, can betransferred to a federal penitentiary with treatment programmesavailable while awaiting sentence (s. 135(2), Corrections andConditional Release Act, S.C. 1992, c. 20, as amended). Thelack of access to such programs is considered a rationale forenhanced credit for time in pre-trial custody. In this case, itis not clear why the appellant was not transferred to a federalpenitentiary.[20] Here, the appellant has spent a total of 1,337 days (664days on his first breach and 673 days on the breaches in thiscase) in custody while his LTSO continued to run. That periodamounts to more than one-half of the original seven-year periodthe LTSO was intended to apply.[21] I recognize that the awarding of credit for pre-sentencecustody is a matter within the discretion of the sentencingjudge. Here, despite the sentencing judge's factual mistake ingranting the appellant less credit for pre-sentence custodythan it seems he intended to, I would not disturb the sentenceactually imposed. The sentence actually imposed was fit for theoffences considering the circumstances of the appellant, andthe rationale for a LTSO for a period of seven years is notundermined by the sentencing judge's calculation error. Theconsiderations I have discussed point towards less credit forpre-trial custody while a LTSO is in effect than in othercases.[22] I would grant leave to appeal [the] sentence but dismissthe appeal.Appeal dismissed."}

ScaravelliHeard:October\n29, 2013, in Pictou, Nova ScotiaOral\nDecision:December 11, 2013Counsel:Patrick\nYoung, for the CrownStephen\nRobertson, for the DefenceBy\nthe Court (Orally):[1]Michael\nBrannan appears for sentencing following a guilty plea to a charge of break and\nenter and theft contrary to s. 348(1)b of the Criminal Code.[2]On\nNovember 30, 2007, while the victim was away from home, the offender entered\nher dwelling house through an unlocked back door.Items stolen from the house\nincluded: a digital camera, a DVD player, power drill, and jewellery.The\noffender also stole a gun cabinet attached to the wall containing six rifles.The offender broke into an outside shed and stole a table saw.The victim\nestimated the value of stolen property to be approximately $10,000.[3]I have\nreviewed the pre-sentence report.I have also reviewed correspondence from his\nparole officer and employer.Mr. Brannan is currently 30 years of age.He has\nbeen in a common-law relationship for the past three years.He and his spouse\nare raising three children.Mr. Brannan works regular part-time as a\ndishwasher at a local restaurant.He admits to regular use of marijuana to\ndeal with anxiety and stress.[4]The\noffender has one conviction for break, enter and theft as a young offender in\n1999.The offender’s criminal record also indicates convictions for four\ncounts of break and enters in 2011.As the current offence occurred in 2007,\nhe would be considered a first time adult offender for the purposes of\nsentencing.[5]Although\nno victim impact statement was provided to The Court, the crown advises the\nvictim subsequently installed a security system, obtained a dog and eventually\nmoved out of the home as a result of the break and enter.[6]In\ndetermining the appropriate sentence, I must consider the purpose and\nprinciples of sentencing as set out in s. 718 to s. 718.2 of the Criminal\nCode.The Courts have consistently confirmed that the principles of\ndeterrence and denunciation are of prime importance in cases of this nature, in\nparticular, break and enter into dwelling homes.The sentence must also be\nproportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of the\nresponsibility of the offender.Aggravating and mitigating circumstances are\nto be considered by The Court.I am also required to consider the\nrehabilitation of the offender.A sentence should be in a range imposed on\nsimilar offences and similar circumstances.[7]Mitigating\nfactors are the offender entered an early guilty plea.He is gainfully\nemployed in a part-time position and, at the time of the offence, was a first\ntime adult offender.Aggravating factors are the break and enter was planned\nand committed for profit.The value of the property stolen was high and\nincluded firearms.The offender denied involvement in the offence in a\nstatement given to police in 2012.[8]The\ndefence submits a conditional sentence is a proper sentence in this case.The\noffence predates the amendments to the Criminal Code which disallow the\nimposition of a conditional sentence order for the offence of break and enter.[9]The\ncrown referring to the benchmark of three years of imprisonment as prescribed\nby the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal, recommends a sentence of imprisonment of\nbetween two and three years.[10]Section 742.1 of the Criminal\nCode authorizes The Court to make an order for a conditional sentence when\nthe offender is sentenced to imprisonment of less than two years.The\nconditional sentence can be imposed where The Court is satisfied that serving\nthe sentence in the community would not endanger the safety of the community\nand would be consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of\nsentencing set out in s. 718 to s. 718.2.An offender serving a sentence in\nthe community is subject to conditions set out in s. 742.3.In R. v. Proulx\n2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), [2000] 1 SCR 61, the Supreme Court of Canada details a procedure to be\nfollowed by a judge considering a conditional sentence.At the first stage,\nthe judge must be satisfied that the appropriate sentence is a custodial one of\nless than two years.Secondly, The Court must be satisfied that having the\noffender serve the sentence in the community would not endanger its safety.If\nso, The Court considers whether a conditional sentence would be consistent with\nthe fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing as set out in s. 718 to s.\n718.2.[11]Under s. 348(1)(d) of the Code\nthe offence of break and enter into a dwelling house carries a maximum term of\nlife imprisonment, while a break and enter into other premises involves a lower\nmaximum penalty of 10 years.The statutory maximum reflects the extreme\nseriousness with which Parliament regards the offence of home invasion.It is\na crime that violates the sanctity of the home and its occupants.In this\nregard, our Court of Appeal has repeatedly stated that a single break and enter\noffence attracts a benchmark sentence of three years.R. v. Zang [1986]\nNSJ 207; R. v. McAllister, (2008) NSSA 103.This benchmark can be\noffset one way or another according to mitigating or aggravating circumstances.In R. v. Adams, (2010) NSCA 42, Bateman J. stated:[42] . . . the absence of a prior record might warrant\na reduction from the benchmark to two years.[12]Defence counsel referred\nThe Court to a number of cases predating R. v. Zang where more lenient\nsentences have been imposed.For recent cases, the defence cited R. v.\nPerrin,(2012) NSCA 85 and R. v. Best [2012], NSJ 175, (NSCA) 34.In R. v. Perrin the 21 year old accused participated in break and enter\nand theft of copper piping and speakers from a cottage.He gave police a full\nconfession and showed police items he had taken.He had a prior criminal\nrecord and was serving a conditional sentence at the time of the offence.The\nCourt of Appeal upheld the sentence of 30 days imprisonment and 18 months’\nprobation in addition to his requirement to serve the remaining 34 days of his\nconditional sentence.In describing the “short sharp” sentence as lenient, The\nCourt found that the sentencing judge did not err in principle.In R. v.\nBest the Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal from sentence of 90 days\nintermittent plus two years’ probation for an offence of break and enter and\naggravated assault, however, The Court found the sentencing judge erred in\nprinciple by not emphasising denunciation and deterrence.Although the\nsentence was demonstrably unfit, The Court found it was not in the interest of\njustice to re-incarcerate the offender following completion of his sentence and\nportion of his probation without incident[13]In the present case the\noffender shoulders a high degree of responsibility.His level of intrusion\ninto the home was extensive in that he stole the items from various rooms and\nlevels in the house.A vehicle was backed to the outside shed where a table\nsaw was loaded and removed indicating that an extended period of time was\ninvolved.A crowbar was found outside the dwelling.The Court is of the view\nthat in order to adequately address the need for denunciation and deterrence, a\npenitentiary sentence is necessary in this case.This excludes the\nconsideration of the possibility of a conditional sentence.I am also mindful\nthat the offender has a heightened prospect for rehabilitation.He is only 30\nyears of age, in a stable marriage relationship, and has obtained regular employment.He would have been 24 years of age at the time of the offence.In my view the\ncircumstances warrant a reduction from the bench mark of three years.[14]It is the sentence of The\nCourt that Mr. Brannan serve two years in a federal institution."}

Nuttall)))Mr. DouglasGrace and Ms. Anya Shahabi, for the Accused)Accused))))HEARD:February 9, 2017REASONS FOR SENTENCEConlan J.I.Introduction[1]What\nsentence should be imposed on a first-time offender who has been found guilty\nof three counts of simple possession of three different controlled substances,\none of them being a sizeable quantity of cocaine?[2]That\nis the question to be decided.[3]Mr.\nDruin Nuttall was tried before me, without a jury, in Owen Sound in December\n2016.[4]In\nwritten Reasons for Judgment reported at 2016 ONSC 7777 (CanLII), I found Mr.\nNuttall not guilty of possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking but\nguilty of the lesser and included offence of simple possession of cocaine,\nguilty of simple possession of methamphetamine, and guilty of simple possession\nof codeine.[5]The\nsentencing hearing was held in Owen Sound on today’s date, February 9, 2017.II.The Facts[6]The\nfollowing summary of the facts is taken from paragraphs 5 through 11 of the\nReasons for Judgment.An\nOverview of the Facts[5]In\nthe evening on October 15, 2015, after a few months of police investigation,\nMr. Nuttall was stopped by the police while driving northbound on Highway 10,\nin Grey County (just north of the village of Markdale).He was the only\noccupant of the car, which vehicle was owned by his girlfriend.[6]The\naccused was arrested for possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking.[7]The\nauthorities believed that Mr. Nuttall was picking up cocaine in the Toronto\narea and transporting it to Owen Sound for the purpose of trafficking in it.[8]After\nthe arrest at the roadside, Mr. Nuttall was then searched by the police and\nfound to be in possession of, among other things, $440.00 in cash (twenty-two\n$20.00 bills).[9]The\ncar was also searched by the police.Inside a backpack was found 29.4 grams of\ncocaine.Three cellular telephones were also seized by the police.[10]The\npolice then searched the accused’s residence, which he shared with others.They seized some items with cocaine residue on them, other things believed to\nbe indicative of drug trafficking (like a digital scale, for example), and a\nhalf-full bottle of liquid codeine.[11]The\npolice also searched the electronic devices that had been seized at the\nroadside.Photographs were taken of text messages that were on one of those\ncellular telephones.[7]The\nmethamphetamine was a very small quantity found on a digital scale in the\noffender’s bedroom.[8]The codeine was a\nhalf-full bottle of liquid found in the offender’s bedroom.[9]In\nterms of why the Court acquitted Mr. Nuttall on the cocaine charge as laid, I\nset out here paragraphs 60 through 63 of the Reasons for Judgment.[60]On\nthe totality of the evidence adduced at trial, including a consideration of the\nabsence of evidence, I am more than just suspicious, especially given the text\nmessages.I would go as far as to say that I think that Mr. Nuttall was probably\ndealing cocaine and was likely intending to do the same with what was\ndiscovered in his backpack.[61]But\nI am just not sure of that.[62]An\nintention to traffic is certainly one reasonable inference to be drawn from the\nproven facts, however, particularly given the accused’s statement and the\nabsence of evidence summarized above, other reasonable inferences to be drawn\nare that Mr. Nuttall is a heavy marihuana user, a heavy cocaine user, is\ninvolved with other buddies in a marihuana lounge (which involvement takes him\nto and from Toronto regularly), and is generally someone immersed in the drug\nsubculture but whose purpose for possessing the cocaine in the backpack was not\nto traffic in it.[63]]Accordingly,\na finding of guilt on the lesser and included offence of simple possession of\ncocaine is the appropriate result.III.The Offender[10]Mr.\nNuttall is currently 37 years old.He has no prior criminal record.He is not\nemployed and is in receipt of disability benefits.He has obeyed rather strict\nbail conditions, including house arrest later amended to a daily curfew, since\nOctober 2015.He has two children, ages 1 and 14 years.Tragically, the\nmother of the teenager died not long ago.[11]The\nCrown concedes that Mr. Nuttall was cooperative with the police.For example,\nhe readily confessed to ownership of the items found within the motor vehicle.[12]The\nCourt has received letters from Mr. Nuttall’s mother, his father, and his\ngirlfriend.Those letters speak highly of the offender and indicate that he\nappears to have changed his life and abstained from illegal narcotics since the\ntime of his arrest.The letters also speak about the importance of Mr. Nuttall\nin the lives of his two children, his partner and his parents, but especially\nhis teenage daughter who is struggling to cope with the loss of her mother.Finally, the letters confirm that the offender is remorseful for his actions\nand committed to his rehabilitation from what is described as a serious\naddiction to drugs.IV.The Positions of the Parties[13]The\nCrown requests the following sentence:6 to 8 months in custody, in totality.[14]The\nDefence requests a suspended sentence and probation for 12 months.[15]Both\nsides agree that a conditional sentence order is statutorily available to Mr.\nNuttall.And both sides agree that the Court could impose what is commonly\nreferred to as a blended sentence, for example, jail on the cocaine conviction and\na conditional sentence order or probation on the other two matters.V.AnalysisThe Legal Parameters[16]There\nare no minimum penalties for any of the three offences.[17]The\nmaximum penalty for each is imprisonment for seven (7) years.The Basic Legal Principles on Sentencing[18]Sentencing\nis a highly discretionary and individualized process.[19]I\nmust have regard to the principles of sentencing outlined in section 718 of the\nCriminal Code of Canada – denunciation, specific and general deterrence,\nthe need to separate certain offenders from society, rehabilitation,\nrestorative justice and the promotion of responsibility in offenders.[20]Because\nof the nature of these offences and the personal circumstances of this\noffender, there is some tension between what would otherwise be the paramount\nsentencing principles.On the one hand, for these types of offences,\ndenunciation and general deterrence are key.On the other hand, for a first\noffender, rehabilitation and specific deterrence are important.[21]Any\nsentence imposed must be proportionate to the gravity of the offences and the\ndegree of responsibility of the offender – section 718.1.[22]These\nare serious offences, particularly the cocaine.[23]Mr.\nNuttall should not be deprived of his liberty if less appropriate sanctions are\nappropriate in the circumstances – subsection 718.2(d).I should consider all\navailable sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the\ncircumstances – subsection 718.2(e).[24]Any\ncustodial sentence imposed on a first offender ought to be as short as\nreasonably possible in the circumstances.Further, it ought to be tailored to\nthe accused rather than solely for the purpose of general deterrence.The Aggravating and Mitigating Factors[25]In\nmy view, the major aggravating factors here are (i) the sizeable quantity of\ncocaine and (ii) the fact that Mr. Nuttall was in possession of not just one\nbut three illegal substances, at least two of which (the cocaine and the\nmethamphetamine) are real scourges on our society.[26]The\nmain mitigating factors are (i) the lack of any prior criminal history and (ii)\nthe offender’s cooperation with the police.The Jurisprudence[27]No\ntwo cases are ever the same.Sentencing decisions can always be distinguished\non their facts.[28]Of\nthe cases filed by both sides, the two that are most relevant are Her\nMajesty the Queen v. Chad Lake, an unreported decision of Justice Seppi of\nthe Superior Court of Justice in Brampton made on January 13, 2004 (relied upon\nby the Crown), and R. v. Day, 2011 ONSC 1148 (CanLII), a decision of\nJustice Thorburn (relied upon by the Defence).[29]In\nLake, supra, after a trial, the offender was acquitted of possession of\ncocaine for the purpose of trafficking but found guilty of simple possession of\n12 grams of crack cocaine.Mr. Lake was in his early twenties at the time of\nthe offence.He had no prior criminal record.He was employed.He had four\nyoung children.There was cogent evidence that he was a drug addict.He was\non bail at the time of his arrest.Justice Seppi sentenced Mr. Lake to 6\nmonths in jail to be followed by 6 months of probation.A conditional sentence\norder was considered but declined.[30]In\nDay, supra, the offender was found guilty after a trial of several offences\nincluding simple possession of 27.37 grams of cocaine.Mr. Day was in his late\ntwenties at the time of sentencing.He had no prior criminal record.He was\nemployed.He had no children and lived with his girlfriend.He used drugs but\ndescribed himself as a non-addict.Justice Thorburn imposed a conditional\nsentence order of 2 years less 1 day in length, globally, on all convictions.What is a fit Sentence for Mr. Nuttall?[31]In\nmy view, it is difficult to reconcile the two decisions referred to above.They\nare simply illustrative of what both counsel submitted to the Court today –\nthere is a very wide range of sentences available on these offences.[32]I\nthink that one of the chief distinguishing factors between Mr. Lake and Mr. Day\nis the degree to which the latter rehabilitated himself after his arrest.Mr.\nDay had “done everything one could have asked him”, including completing\nschool, maintaining good employment, and fostering healthier relationships (see\nparagraph 24 of the reported decision).[33]I\nsee Mr. Nuttall’s situation, overall, as more similar to that of Mr. Lake than\nthat of Mr. Day.I simply do not have the same degree of evidence before me,\nand neither did Justice Seppi, that was placed before Justice Thorburn and\nwhich caused that Court to conclude that any length of time in jail would\namount to a serious setback to the offender’s recovery (see paragraph 25 of the\ndecision of Thorburn J.).[34]I\nreach the same conclusion as that of the Court in the Lake, supra\ndecision; a conditional sentence order is not sufficient in these circumstances\nto meet the objectives of sentencing, particularly denunciation and general\ndeterrence.[35]For\npossessing a cocktail of illegal narcotics, including nearly 30 grams of\ncocaine, Mr. Nuttall must be sentenced to some time in a correctional facility.[36]It\nnecessarily follows that I reject the Defence request for probation on its own.I was impressed with the submissions of Defence counsel, however, such a\nsentence in my view, for this offender on these facts, would be inadequate.[37]Six\nmonths in jail, however, is too long for Mr. Nuttall.Unlike Mr. Lake, Mr.\nNuttall was not on bail at the time of his arrest, and that factor was\nidentified by Seppi J. as a major aggravating one.[38]Further,\nMr. Nuttall appears to have a closer relationship with his children than Mr.\nLake did.Certainly, it is relatively unique that Mr. Nuttall finds himself\nbeing sentenced when his daughter has recently lost her mother and he has an\ninfant child at home.[39]As\nwell, there is no indication that Mr. Lake cooperated with the police to the\ndegree that Mr. Nuttall did.[40]A\nrelatively short jail sentence for Mr. Nuttall will suffice, to be followed by\nprobation.[41]I\ncontemplated having a conditional sentence order follow the time in jail,\nhowever, I have concluded that the same end can be accomplished through\nprobation.VI.Conclusion[42]The\nsentence of the Court is as follows.[43]On\nthe simple possession of cocaine, a conviction is registered, and Mr. Nuttall\nis sentenced to 90 days in custody.[44]On\nthe other two matters, the simple possession of methamphetamine and the simple\npossession of codeine, suspended sentences are imposed and Mr. Nuttall is\nplaced on one probation order for 12 months.All of the statutory terms\napply.In addition, Mr. Nuttall shall report to probation;he shall attend\nfor any counselling or treatment recommended and not leave that program without\npermission from the supervisor;he shall sign any releases of information\ndemanded of him to monitor compliance with counselling or treatment;he shall\nabstain from non-prescription drugs;and he shall obey a curfew of 11:00 p.m.\nto 6:00 a.m., daily, except for medical or dental emergencies for him or one of\nhis children or his girlfriend and except for other times as approved in\nwriting in advance by the supervisor.[45]The\ncurfew condition is being imposed for two reasons.First, to provide some\nteeth to the probation order such that it adds something to the denunciatory\nand deterrent effect of the overall sentence but still respects the importance\nof rehabilitation.Second, I am not aware of anything that will cause that term\nto unduly prejudice the offender or his family.[46]The\nmandatory victim fine surcharges are imposed on all three matters, with 12\nmonths to pay upon Mr. Nuttall’s release from custody.___________________________Conlan\nJ.Released:February 9, 2017CITATION: Her Majesty the Queen v.

(the victim named in the Indictment)\nand Mr. M.K.1.[2]At\nthe conclusion of the sentencing hearing I made findings of fact and heard\nsubmissions as to sentence.On January 19, 2017, I imposed sentence on Mr.\nM.K.1 and gave oral reasons.R v M.K.1, 2017 NWTSC 11 (CanLII).I indicated at\nthe time that I would file Supplemental Reasons to explain my findings of\ncredibility and address other issues that arose during the hearing.These are\nthose Reasons.II)PROCEDURAL HISTORY[3]The\nevents leading to the charge occurred in the early morning hours of April 26,\n2015.M.K. made her complaint to the police that evening.[4]Mr.\nM.K.1 was charged and had a number of appearances before the Territorial\nCourt.He initially elected to have a jury trial and to have a preliminary hearing.He later waived the preliminary hearing and re-elected to be tried by a judge\nof this Court, without a jury.[5]On\nDecember 4, 2015, Mr. M.K.1's counsel at the time, Michael Martin, wrote to the\nCourt indicating that Mr. M.K.1 wished to plead guilty to this charge and\nanother unrelated sexual assault charge.An appearance was arranged in\nYellowknife for that purpose.[6]On\nDecember 14, 2015 Mr. M.K.1 entered guilty pleas to the two charges.At the\ntime the guilty pleas were entered, Mr. Martin confirmed that the pleas were\nvoluntary, fully informed and met all the requirements set out at section\n606(1.1) of the Criminal Code.[7]The\nsentencing hearing for both matters was scheduled to proceed on April 18,\n2016.It was scheduled to proceed in Inuvik, at Mr. M.K.1's request.There\nwas no indication, at that point, that any of the Crown's allegations would be\ndisputed.[8]The\nsentencing hearing, as it turned out, did not proceed on that date.Mr. Martin\narranged to have Mr. M.K.1 appear before the Court in Yellowknife ahead of the\nhearing date.On April 13, 2016, Mr. M.K.1's matters were spoken to in\nYellowknife.Mr. Martin told the Court that Mr. M.K.1 was asking to be\nrepresented by a different lawyer.Mr. Martin asked to be removed as counsel\nof record and this request was granted.Mr. Martin told the Court that he\nunderstood that Jay Bran, another defence counsel, might be taking over as Mr.\nM.K.1's counsel.[9]Mr.\nBran was present in the courtroom and confirmed that he would be taking over\nthe legal representation of Mr. M.K.1.He also indicated that Mr. M.K.1 might\nbring an application to have the guilty pleas struck.Crown and Defence agreed\nthat the April 18, 2016 sentencing hearing in Inuvik should be cancelled to\ngive counsel the time needed to obtain instructions and determine what the next\nsteps should be.[10]Counsel\neventually confirmed that there would be an application to withdraw the guilty\nplea with respect to the charge involving M.K.[11]The\napplication to strike the guilty plea proceeded on August 8, 2016.It was\ndismissed on August 23, 2016.R v M.K.1, 2017 NWTSC 4 (CanLII).[12]On\na subsequent appearance, counsel advised that the facts would be disputed at\nthe sentencing hearing and that viva voce evidence would have to be\ncalled.The hearing was scheduled to proceed in Inuvik commencing on January\n17, 2017.III)EVIDENCE ADDUCED AT THE\nSENTENCING HEARING[13]At\nthe start of the sentencing hearing, no specifics were provided as to what\naspects of the Crown's allegations were in dispute.At the conclusion of the\nevidence, it was apparent that there were a number of things with which Mr.\nM.K.1 did not actually take issue.[14]At\nthe time of these events, M.K. lived in U[…].In April 2015 she went to Inuvik\nfor a visit and stayed at the M.K.1 residence.M.K.'s aunt is Mr. M.K.1’s\ncommon law spouse of many years.M.K. considered Mr. M.K.1 to be her uncle.[15]On\nthe evening of April 25, 2015, M.K., Mr. M.K.1 and his spouse spent the evening\nsocializing, first at the house and later at the Trapper's Bar.They consumed\nbeer throughout the evening.Everyone had a good time.There was no evidence\nof anyone having become grossly intoxicated.[16]They\nstayed at the bar until closing time and then returned home.A short time\nafter their return, everyone went to bed.Mr. M.K.1 and his wife went to their\nroom and M.K. went to her room.[17]It\nwas undisputed that some time after this, Mr. M.K.1 came out of his room, went\ninto M.K.'s room, and had sexual intercourse with her. The central issues at\nthe hearing were how this sexual contact came to happen, and whether it was\nconsensual.I now turn to the evidence relating more specifically to those\nissues.1.M.K.'s\nevidence[18]M.K.\ntestified that after they returned from the bar she passed out in her room.She woke up to Mr. M.K.1 on top of her, having sexual intercourse with her.She\ntried to push him off but he was too heavy.She did not want him to do this\nand kept telling him to leave but he just \"kept going\".She did not\nremember if he touched her anywhere else on her body.All she remembered Mr.\nM.K.1 saying to her during this was \"you're so tight nobody fuck you,\nyou're so tight nobody fuck you\".[19]When\nhe was done, he got off her.She curled up and went to sleep.The next\nmorning she left the house.She went walking around for a while.During the\nday she returned to the M.K.1 residence a number of times.The last time she\nwas there she started feeling \"uneasy and yukky\" and left.She went\nto see her friend Diane and told her about what happened.She then went to the\nhospital to visit some relatives.While she was at the hospital, she reported\nthe matter to the police.[20]M.K.\ndid not remember how much she had to drink that night but said she remembered\nthe evening up until when she went to bed and passed out, and then waking up to\nMr. M.K.1 on top of her.[21]She\nsaid she tried to push Mr. M.K.1 off for a while and eventually gave up.She\nwas not sure how long she tried to push him off.She acknowledged that she did\nnot hit him or kick at him.[22]She\nacknowledged that she did not scream or call out for help while Mr. M.K.1 was\non top of her, even though she knew her aunt was in a room across the hall.On\nCross-Examination, it was suggested to her that the reason she did not scream\nfor help was because she was consenting to what was happening.She denied\nthis.[23]M.K.\nacknowledged that she returned to the M.K.1 residence a number of times during\nthe day despite what had happened.She also acknowledged that throughout the\nday, she saw various people.She agreed with the suggestion, put to her on\nCross-Examination, that there was nothing stopping her from telling those\npeople what happened to her.[24]M.K.\ntestified during her Examination-in-Chief that she went to bed fully clothed,\nand that when she woke up the clothes on the lower half of her body had been\nremoved.She also said that she went to the bathroom before going to bed.In\nCross-Examination she was asked if it was possible that, after she went to the\nbathroom, she did not put her underwear and leggings back on before going to\nbed.Defence counsel put a few questions to her about this topic:Q.\nIs it possible after you [went to the bathroom] you simply didn’t put your\nclothes back on from the waist down and you went to bed only with your top on?A. No, I don’t remember that.Q.\nSo by not remembering it is possible that when you went to the bathroom and you\ntook off your leggings and your underwear to use the washroom to urinate it’s\npossible that you came back to bed without wearing that clothes from your waist\ndown, right?A. Oh God.Excerpt of the\nSentencing Hearing (Evidence of M.K.), p.34 lines\n15-25.[25]M.K.\nwas becoming very upset and emotional at this point.I asked her if she\nunderstood the question.She said she did.I repeated counsel's question,\nasking whether it was possible that she did not put her clothes back on after\ngoing to the bathroom.M.K. answered “It could be possible”.[26]At\nthe very end of the Cross-Examination, it was suggested to M.K. that when Mr.\nM.K.1 came into her room, she invited him on to the bed to have sex with her.She\nanswered \"I don't, I don't recall that\".2.Mr. M.K.1's\nevidence[27]Mr.\nM.K.1 testified that a few minutes after he retired to his bedroom with his\nspouse, he came back out because he needed to use the bathroom.[28]Before\ngoing back to his room, he peeked into M.K.'s room.She was lying on the\nmattress on the floor, naked from the waist down.As soon as he peeked in she\nlifted both her legs up in the air towards her head; she opened her legs,\nexposing her genitals to him.He took this as an invitation to have sex.He\ntook off his shorts and began having intercourse with her.He was positioned\nin front of her, on his knees, holding her legs.He was not lying on top of\nher.She did not try to push him away.[29]There\nwas no verbal exchange between him and M.K. before, during, or after the sex.M.K. appeared to enjoy what was happening. She made the kinds of noises people\nnormally make when they are having consensual sex.[30]After\nhe was done he stood up to put his shorts back on.She turned around and\npositioned herself on her hands and knees with her buttocks towards him.He\nleft the room and went to sleep on the couch.IV)ANALYSIS[31]My\nfindings of fact were, obviously, driven by my assessment of the credibility\nand the reliability of the evidence of these two witnesses.Before I explain\nthose findings, I want to briefly address the legal framework that applies in\nthese circumstances.1.Legal framework[32]Crown\nand Defence disagreed about many things at this hearing, including aspects of\nthe legal framework that governed it.One thing they did agree about was that\nthis was a very unusual sentencing hearing.[33]A\nsentencing hearing is not a trial.A guilty plea, in law, constitutes an\nadmission of the essential elements of the offence.It relieves the Crown of\nits evidentiary burden to prove those elements.An accused who has pleaded\nguilty no longer benefits from the presumption of innocence.R v\nDuong, 2006 BCCA 325 (CanLII).[34]Because\nof this, the rules of evidence, at a sentencing hearing, are more relaxed than\nthey are at trial.The Court has a broad discretion in deciding what\ninformation will be relied on and how that information will be presented to the\nCourt:723 (1) Before\ndetermining the sentence, a court shall give the prosecutor and the offender an\nopportunity to make submissions with respect to any facts relevant to the\nsentence to be imposed.(2) The\ncourt shall hear any relevant evidence presented by the prosecutor or the\noffender.(3) The\ncourt may, on its own motion, after hearing argument from the prosecutor and\nthe offender, require the production of evidence that would assist it in\ndetermining the appropriate sentence.(4) Where\nit is necessary in the interests of justice, the court may, after consulting\nthe parties, compel the appearance of any person who is a compellable witness\nto assist the court in determining the appropriate sentence.(5) Hearsay\nevidence is admissible at sentencing proceedings, but the court may, if the\ncourt considers it to be in the interests of justice, compel a person to\ntestify where the person(a) has\npersonal knowledge of the matter;(b) is\nreasonably available; and(c) is a\ncompellable witness.724 (1) In\ndetermining a sentence, a court may accept as proved any information disclosed\nat the trial or at the sentencing proceedings and any facts agreed on by the\nprosecutor and the offender.(…)Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985,\nc. C-46, ss. 723 and 724(1).[35]When\na fact is in dispute, the burden to prove that fact is on the party wishing to\nrely on it.The burden of proof that generally applies is proof on a balance\nof probabilities.However, any aggravating fact that the Crown wants to rely\non and is disputed, and any past conviction that is disputed, must be proven by\nthe Crown beyond a reasonable doubt.Criminal Code, supra,\nSubsection 724(3).[36]What\nwas unusual about this case was that the key disputed facts were not\naggravating facts; they were the facts making out essential elements of the\noffence (M.K.’s lack of consent and Mr. M.K.1's knowledge of her lack of\nconsent).[37]This\ngave rise to the issue of what standard of proof I should apply in making\nfactual findings.Not surprisingly, that issue is not addressed in the\nsentencing provisions of the Criminal Code because a sentencing hearing\nis not supposed to be about proof of the elements of the offence.[38]I\nunderstood the Crown to be arguing that because of the guilty plea, the\nstandard of proof that I should apply was something less than proof beyond a\nreasonable doubt.The Crown did not refer to any cases in support of this\nposition.In the alternative, the Crown argued that the guilty plea should\ngive rise to an adverse inference against Mr. M.K.1.No case was referred to\nin support of this position either.[39]Mr.\nM.K.1's counsel argued that the standard of proof should be proof beyond a\nreasonable doubt.Again, I was not referred to any case in support of that\nposition.[40]Considering\nthat, even at the sentencing stage, the standard of proof beyond a reasonable\ndoubt is the one that applies to disputed aggravating facts and disputed criminal\nconvictions, I find it difficult to conceive how a lower standard could apply\nto facts that are at the heart of an essential element of the offence.[41]With\nrespect to the issue of adverse inference, I want to make it clear that in this\ncase, I would have rejected Mr. M.K.1's evidence irrespective of his guilty\nplea.My reasons for that are outlined below at Paragraphs 44 to 68.[42]That\nbeing said, I agree with the Crown that it would have been open to me to draw\nan adverse inference against Mr. M.K.1’s credibility under these\ncircumstances.I will return to that issue later in these Reasons.But\nfirst, I will explain why I came to the conclusions I did in my assessment of\nthe credibility and reliability of the testimonies of M.K. and of Mr. M.K.1.2.Assessment\nof credibility[43]In\nassessing the evidence, I have taken into account, among other things, the\ninconsistencies in the evidence, the plausibility of the witnesses' accounts of\nevents and the demeanour of the witnesses.I have exercised caution in my\nconsideration of demeanour, acknowledging that findings of credibility should never\nbe based on that factor alone.[44]I\nrejected Mr. M.K.1's evidence for a number of reasons including: the\nimplausibility of his narrative; subtle - and sometimes not so subtle - shifts\nin his evidence during Cross-Examination; and, generally speaking, his manner\nof responding to questions when he was challenged on certain aspects of his\ntestimony.[45]On\nthe whole, I found Mr. M.K.1's evidence about his interaction with M.K.\nself-serving, implausible and unreliable.I did not believe his version of how\nthe sexual contact between him and M.K. unfolded, and his evidence did not\nraise any doubt in my mind.[46]Inconsistencies\nin the evidence are to be expected, especially when someone testifies about\nevents that occurred a long time ago.Not all inconsistencies mean that\nsomeone is being dishonest or does not remember the events.Inconsistencies\nmay well arise from innocent mistakes.[47]But\nother times, inconsistencies, even about minor points, may indicate that the\nwitness is making things up, is exaggerating, is attempting to tailor the\nevidence to suit his or her particular needs, and is getting caught in lies.I found some of the inconsistencies and shifts in Mr. M.K.1’s evidence did not\narise from innocent mistakes.[48]In\nsome instances, it seemed that when Mr. M.K.1 was challenged on Cross-Examination\nabout something, he added more and more details to bolster his evidence.And\nas he did, contradictions emerged and his evidence became weaker.[49]Some\nof this happened when he was being questioned about relatively innocuous\ntopics.For example, Mr. M.K.1 was asked a series of questions in\nCross-Examination about the effect that drinking alcohol had on his perceptions\nthat night:Q.\nAnd would you agree with me that your perception is a little different if\nyou’re sober as opposed to after having five to seven drinks?A.\nDoesn’t make any effect to me about how much beer I had because I’m, I’m a\nheavy drinker. I can drink beer all night.Q. You can drink beer all night?A. Yeah.Q. So the amount of beer that you had\nthat night didn’t affect you at all?A. Not that much.Q. What did it do to you?A. Just made me want to dance on the\ndance floor.Q. And was that something you would do\nif you were sober?A. Yeah. I would do that if I was sober,\ndance a few times, yeah.Q. And what did you do differently - -A. Nothing differentExcerpt\nof Sentencing Hearing (Evidence of M.K.1), p.32 line 9 to\np. 33, line 4.[50]The\nquestions put to Mr. M.K.1 were clear and pertained to a simple topic. He\nseemed very reluctant to admit that the alcohol he consumed had any effect on\nhim that night.When he did, he was careful to minimize the impact that\nalcohol had on him.He vacillated between the alcohol having had no effect at\nall, to it having had only a little effect, eventually going back to saying it\nhad no effect at all.[51]Something\nsimilar happened when he was pressed about why he knew that his daughter was\nnot home when they returned from the bar:Q. And was S.’s door closed or open?A. S.’s door was open because she was\nnot home.Q. How do you know she was not home?A.\nBecause her shoes and parka were not there when we arrive and there was nobody\nin the house.Q. Did you ever look in her room?A.\nYeah. I know when she’s home. She always have her runners there and her jacket\nhanged up in the porch.Q. Did you see her?Did you look in her\nroom?A. Yeah. She was not in her room when we\narrived.Q. Did you look in the room?A. Yes, I did.Q. And when did you look in the room?A. When I was upstairs.Q. When was that?A.\nLike I said, when I went upstairs you could see her room. When we go to the\nbathroom it’s open and she’s not in her room.Q. Okay. Which time because you went\nupstairs twice you told us now - -A.\nYeah. The first time. The first time I went upstairs you could see her room\nwhen we go to the bathroom or into our room.You could see her room open and\nnobody was in there.Q. Did you look inside?A. No.You can see inside the room\nthere. She was not home.Q. But you didn’t look inside?A.\nNo, I looked inside.I could see inside. You could see the whole room in there\nbut there was nobody inside the room.Excerpt\nof Sentencing Hearing (Evidence of M.K.1), p.40 line 17\nto p.41 line 21.[52]On\nthis topic Mr. M.K.1 was consistent that his daughter was not home.But again,\nhis reasons for being sure about that fact shifted and evolved as he was\npressed on the issue.Initially he said he knew she was not home because her\nshoes and clothes were not in the porch.As the questioning went on he eventually\nsaid that he looked into her room and saw that she was not there.If that is\nthe case, it seems strange that this was not the first answer he gave when he\nwas asked how he knew she was not home.[53]Another\nexample was in Mr. M.K.1's answers when it was suggested to him that he is much\nlarger than M.K.He seemed reluctant to acknowledge even that.In his initial\nanswer he agreed he is larger than M.K. now, but specified that he gained a lot\nof weight since being in custody.When the Crown pressed the issue and asked\nhim about his weight back in April 2015, he said he weighed about 195 pounds.He\neventually conceded that even back in April 2015, M.K. was much smaller than\nhim.It seems clear that at all relevant times, Mr. M.K.1 was much larger than\nM.K.His reluctance to simply acknowledge that the first time he was asked\nstruck me as odd.[54]These\nexamples relate to topics that were not crucial to the determination of the\nmost important areas of dispute at the sentencing hearing.But they are examples\nof how Mr. M.K.1 came across on Cross-Examination, and how he reacted when he\nperceived his account of events was being challenged.[55]In\naddition, there were points in his Cross-Examination where Mr. M.K.1 appeared\nto be grasping at straws.In denying that M.K. tried to push him off, he added\nthat if she had tried to push him he would have had bruises on him, and that\nthe police did not have any photographs showing bruises to his body.I found\nthis evidence somewhat peculiar.The force that M.K. described using was not\nthe type of the force that could reasonably be expected to leave bruises on her\nassailant.[56]Mr.\nM.K.1 also seemed to remember a lot of innocuous details about the evening, and\nin particular what happened when they returned to the house.He described in\ndetail his spouse going to their bedroom; his spouse going to the bathroom;\nM.K. going to the bathroom; and himself going to the bathroom, all of this over\na period of about fifteen minutes.He was adamant he remembered who went where\nand in what order.[57]When\nhe was asked on Cross-Examination how he knew where people went, he said that\nfrom the living room area, he could tell, by the sound, when people were going\ninside the bathroom and when they were going inside a bedroom.And he seemed\nquite sure about who went where when.[58]In\nthe context of this case, nothing turns on who went to the bathroom or bedrooms\nor in what order.But I found the progression of Mr. M.K.1's evidence, as he\nperceived that some of his assertions were being challenged, very telling.As\nmore questions were being asked, he claimed to be very sure about these innocuous\ndetails, and offered additional reasons for why he was so sure about these\nthings.[59]Mr.\nM.K.1’s counsel made the point in submissions that Mr. M.K.1’s testimony was\nprecise.I found that it was in fact a little too precise, especially about\nthings that were minor details of an evening that had been, up to that point,\nuneventful.I found the level of detail in his recollection surprising and\nsuspicious.[60]Those\nare all examples of things that, taken individually, may not have much of an\nimpact on my assessment of Mr. M.K.1's credibility.But cumulatively, they\nsuggested to me that Mr. M.K.1 was tailoring his evidence, trying to make it\nbetter and more persuasive, instead of simply recounting events that he\nactually remembered.[61]Quite\napart from my concerns about those somewhat peripheral aspects of his evidence,\nthere were problems in his evidence on topics much more directly connected to\nthe facts in issue.In particular, there were serious problems with his\naccount of his interaction with M.K. when he went into her bedroom.[62]In\nhis Examination in Chief, when he was describing peeking into M.K.’s room after\nhe came out of the bathroom, Mr. M.K.1's counsel asked him whether he made eye\ncontact with M.K.Mr. M.K.1’s answer was “I can’t remember but I think I\ndid”.[63]When\nhe was confronted on Cross-Examination about the lack of verbal communication\nbetween them before the sexual activity started, Mr. M.K.1 acknowledged there\nwas no verbal communication, but he was insistent that their communication took\nplace through their eye contact.He referred four times to eye contact having\nbeen the way they communicated after he peeked in her room.This is a major\ninconsistency on a central topic: Mr. M.K.1 went from \"not\nremembering\" and \"thinking\" they had eye contact to being very\nfirm that they made eye contact and that was how they communicated.[64]Mr.\nM.K.1 was also somewhat inconsistent in his evidence about how exactly he came\nto be in the room.He alternated between saying he \"peeked\" into the\nroom and saying he \"walked\" into the room.His counsel argued that\nperhaps Mr. M.K.1 was using those words interchangeably and that to him, they\nmean the same thing.[65]I\naccept that this could be the case, especially considering that English is not Mr.\nM.K.1's first language.But Mr. M.K.1 himself did not say he was using the\nwords interchangeably.When pressed, he maintained that he peeked into the\nroom.When reminded he had earlier said that he walked into the room, he did\nnot say that he was using the two words interchangeably or that they meant the\nsame thing to him.Instead he became defensive and accused Crown counsel of\nputting words in his mouth:Q.\nI’m going to suggest to you that you in fact went in the room and took her\nclothes off, took her underwear and pants off. What do you say to that?A.\nNo, I don’t agree with that.When I walked into the room she had no pants on\nand no panties on.She was laying on the bed and he put her legs up in the\nair.Q.\nWell, that’s something interesting you just told us there. You said when you\nwalked into the room. I thought you peeked in?A. Yeah. That’s what I mean. I peeked\nin.Q. Peeked in or walked in?A. Peeked in.Q. You just told me you walked in - -A. You’re just putting words in my\nmouth. I said I peeked in.Q. Those in fact are your words sir. So\ndid you walk into the room - -A. I peeked in. Yeah. I peaked in the\nroom there.Q. And do you think you did this or do\nyou know - -A. No, I know I did.Excerpt of\nSentencing Hearing (Evidence of M.K.1), p.49 line 25\nto p.50, line 19.[66]Finally,\nI found Mr. M.K.1’s version of events implausible.M.K. is his niece.She was\nstaying with Mr. M.K.1 and his wife.The three of them had spent a normal\nevening socializing together.No one was grossly intoxicated.According to Mr.\nM.K.1’s version, he looked into her room and, without any conversation or\npreliminaries whatsoever, after a moment of eye contact, she got into this very\nprovocative pose, lifting both her legs up and showing him her genitals, to\ninvite him, her uncle, to have sex with her, with her aunt across the hallway.More than that, after he was putting his shorts back on afterwards, she changed\npositions and adopted another provocative pose, presumably to invite him to\ncontinue.[67]I\nfind Mr. M.K.1’s description of these events implausible and bordering on the\ngrotesque.This is especially so when I consider M.K.'s evidence, and how she\nappeared and reacted when answering questions about what happened.Although\nthe specific gestures attributed to her by Mr. M.K.1 were not put to her on\nCross-Examination and she did not have an opportunity to respond to those\nspecifics, her reactions to the suggestion that she consented to this appeared\nto me to be genuine shock.[68]A\nwitness’ evidence must not be assessed in isolation.It must be assessed in the\ncontext of all of the evidence.In this case, my assessment that Mr. M.K.1’s\nevidence was not credible or reliable was bolstered by my assessment of M.K.’s\ntestimony, which I found very compelling.[69]M.K.\nevidence’s was not perfect. There were things that she did not remember.On a\nfew points, counsel referred her to the statement she gave to police and after\nhaving refreshed her memory, she confirmed certain details that she had not\nremembered at first.But none of those differences pertained to what happened\nin the bedroom.The areas where there were inconsistencies were for the most\npart peripheral and of little significance.[70]For\nexample, in her statement to police, she said that when she returned to the M.K.1\nresidence the day after she was assaulted, everyone was sleeping.In\nCross-Examination she was asked how she knew this.She answered that she saw Mr.\nM.K.1 sleeping on the couch.For the others, she acknowledged that she did not\ngo into their rooms and did not actually see them sleeping.[71]Mr.\nM.K.1's counsel suggested on Cross-Examination that on this point, M.K. was not\nbeing truthful when she spoke to police.In my view that is making way too\nmuch of this aspect of her statement and of her trial testimony.There is no\nindication that she was asked, during the statement, if she actually checked\nthe rooms and saw her aunt or her cousin asleep.My interpretation of the\nevidence is that she assumed that everyone was asleep because she did not see\nanyone up in the house. That is not an unreasonable assumption to make.I do\nnot find this aspect of the evidence has any impact on M.K.'s credibility or\nthe reliability of her evidence on other points.[72]Similarly,\nwhen M.K. was cross-examined about returning to the M.K.1 house the following\nmorning, Defence counsel suggested that her luggage was still at the other\nhouse where she initially planned to stay during her visit to Inuvik.She\nanswered that her luggage was at the M.K.1 house, because she had taken it\nthere once it was decided she would not be at the other house.M.K.\nacknowledged that she did not mention the move of her luggage in her statement\nto police.Again, there is no evidence that she was asked about this during\nher statement so I find this aspect of the evidence of no significance.[73]It\nwas suggested to M.K. that she saw various people that day, and that she could\nhave told someone about this before she told her friend Diane.She agreed that\nthere were others she could have told.I do not find the timing of the\ndisclosure significant in this case, and I draw no adverse inference from it.[74]Although\nthe doctrine of recent complaint has been abolished for many years, it perhaps\nbears repeating that our law now recognizes that this aspect of the law of\nsexual assault, as many others, was rooted in myths and stereotypes about how\n\"true victims\" of sexual assault victims would necessarily react.The abrogation of the doctrine of recent complaint and clear pronouncements by\nthe Supreme Court of Canada make it clear that under our law, delayed disclosure\ndoes not in and of itself make a sexual assault complainant less credible.There are, of course, circumstances where the timing of disclosure may be\nrelevant to the assessment of a complainant's credibility.But on its own, it\nmeans nothing.As we routinely tell juries, there is no rule in life or in law\nabout how a sexual assault victim or a victim of trauma will react.R v\nD.(D.), 2000 SCC 43 (CanLII), para 65.[75]I\nalso want to address the issue of M.K.'s motive to fabricate.The theory\nadvanced by Defence was that M.K. falsely accused Mr. M.K.1 of having sexually\nassaulted her as a form of \"pre-emptive strike\" to ensure that she\nwould not get into trouble with her aunt if she found out that M.K. and Mr.\nM.K.1 had sexual contact that night.[76]The\nproblem with that theory is that there is no evidentiary basis for it.There\nis no evidence whatsoever that M.K.'s aunt found out, or was going to find out,\nabout what happened.If M.K.'s goal was to protect her relationship with her\naunt, accusing her uncle of sexual assault would not be the way to achieve it.Under the circumstances, I found Mr. M.K.1's position about M.K.'s motive to\nfabricate speculative and illogical.[77]I\nconclude that far from suggesting a motive to fabricate, M.K.'s relationship\nwith her aunt actually bolsters her credibility.M.K. stood to lose a lot by\nmaking this complaint.The fact that she did despite the risks that it would\ndestroy her relationship with her aunt supports the notion that something\nserious did in fact happen to her.[78]M.K.'s\ndemeanour during her testimony is also consistent with something serious and\ntraumatic having happened to her.I observed her during her testimony.The Inuvik\ncourtroom is not large and the witness box is a few feet away from where the\njudge sits.The emotion that M.K. showed during her evidence, in particular\nwhen she was describing the act of intercourse, appeared very genuine to me.In\naddition to crying, there were points where she was shaking; on two or three\noccasions she heaved and it appeared that she would vomit.I find it difficult\nto believe that she was faking this.Her reactions and emotions did not appear\nto me to be fabricated, which they would necessarily have to be if she had an\nenjoyable and consensual sexual encounter with Mr. M.K.1 and was lying when she\nwas describing it as having been forced on her.[79]I\nalso note that although she became quite emotionally upset at times during her evidence,\nM.K. was not argumentative or defensive in her testimony.She readily\nacknowledged when she did not remember something.When she was asked to review\nher statement to police she acknowledged what she said in the statement.She\nmade no attempt to justify or rationalize differences between her testimony and\nher statement.[80]Counsel\nsuggested to M.K. at several points during Cross-Examination that she wanted to\nhave sex with Mr. M.K.1.She maintained she was forced.She was not shaken on\nthis point.[81]In\ndeciding that M.K.'s evidence on lack of consent was not shaken on\nCross-Examination, I considered carefully her answer to the last question on\nCross-Examination, referred to above at Paragraph 26.I do not find that, in\nher answer to that last question, M.K. resiled from her earlier answers that\nshe did not want to have sex with Mr. M.K.1.Something was suggested to her\nand she answered she did not recall that.She did not agree with the\nsuggestion.That is consistent with her overall version of events that the\nsexual contact was non-consensual.On the whole, I found that M.K. was\nunshaken in her assertion that she did not consent to the sexual contact with Mr.\nM.K.1.[82]M.K.\nacknowledged that she did not kick or scream during the sexual assault.She\nsaid she tried to push him off but was not strong enough and eventually gave\nup.This makes sense given their differences in size.I also do not find it\ndifficult to understand that she did not scream, under the circumstances.Again, the suggestion that anyone being sexually assaulted would react by\nkicking and screaming is based on the stereotypical assumption that everyone\nundergoing a traumatic event will necessarily react in the same way.[83]Defence\ncounsel pointed out that there were several things that M.K. did not remember.I\ndo not find this surprising given the passage of time.As I mentioned in my\nanalysis of Mr. M.K.1’s evidence, under the circumstances, I find his level of\nprecision far more suspect than M.K.’s inability to recall things like what day\nof the week she arrived in Inuvik; what kind of top she was wearing when she\nwent to bed; whether Mr. M.K.1 touched her anywhere else on her body, or with\nanother part of his body, while she was being subjected to forced intercourse;\nhow much she had to drink that night.[84]Defence\ncounsel noted that the Crown did not call any other witnesses, that there was\nno corroboration of M.K.’s version, no forensic evidence, and no evidence of\nher demeanour when she disclosed these events to her friend Diane or when she\ngave her statement to police.[85]Corroboration\nis not required in law.In some cases the absence of confirmatory evidence may\ngive rise to a reasonable doubt.But I do not find this to be the case here.M.K.'s\nevidence was strong enough and compelling enough to satisfy me beyond a\nreasonable doubt that things unfolded as she described.[86]In\nsummary, I found M.K.’s evidence convincing and compelling.I concluded that Mr.\nM.K.1 had forced sexual intercourse with her that night in the manner that she\ndescribed, and that he knew she was not consenting.[87]However,\nas I said in my oral ruling, I was left with a reasonable doubt about whether\nM.K. went to sleep wearing clothes on the lower part of her body.M.K.\nconceded on Cross-Examination that it was possible that she did not put her\nleggings and underwear back on after she went to the bathroom before going to\nsleep.To the extent that the removal of her clothing by Mr. M.K.1 could be\ncharacterized as an aggravating fact, I concluded that this fact had not been\nproven beyond a reasonable doubt.3.Additional\nComments[88]I\nwill now briefly return to some of the other issues that arose during the\nhearing.[89]As\nnoted above at Paragraph 33, in law, a guilty plea constitutes the admission,\nby the accused, of the essential elements of the offence.It relieves the\nCrown from the burden of proving them.It is a serious step that has\nmeaningful consequences.[90]It\nis precisely because of the importance of that step that Section 606(1.1) of\nthe Criminal Code requires the Court to satisfy itself of certain things\nbefore accepting a guilty plea.The Court must satisfy itself that the plea is\nvoluntary, and that the person offering it fully understands its consequences.Specifically, the Court has to be satisfied that the person offering the plea\nunderstands that the plea is admission of the essential elements of the offence.\nCriminal Code, s. 606(1.1)(b)(i).[91]Denying\nan essential element of the offence at the sentencing hearing stage means\nresiling from the formal admission that the guilty plea represents.That\ncontradiction can give rise to an adverse inference, particularly when there is\nno explanation for it.Mr. M.K.1 offered no such explanation in his testimony\nat the sentencing hearing.[92]Moreover,\nseveral months ago, Mr. M.K.1 applied to have his guilty plea struck and\ntestified on that application.In that testimony, he did not give any\nindication that he was not admitting an essential element of the offence.The\nbasis for his application was that he was confused at the time he entered his\nplea because he was grieving.He confirmed in that testimony that his plea was\nfully informed and that he understood its consequences.R v M.K.1, supra,\npp. 8 to 13.[93]It\nis well established in law that not having intended to admit an essential\nelement of the offence or having a defence to the charge are among the grounds\nthat can be raised when applying to strike a guilty plea.Adgey v The Queen\n1973 CanLII 37 (SCC), [1975] 2 S.C.R. 426; R v. K(S) 1995 CanLII 8926 (ON CA), [1995] O.J. No.1627 (Ont. CA).Given\nthis, one would expect that a person attempting to have a guilty plea struck\nand who claims to have a defence to the charge would put this forward as part\nof the grounds for the application to strike the plea.[94]While\nthere may be some strategic reasons not to reveal the particulars of the\ndefence at that stage, it seems to me that there are also very real risks in\nholding back.[95]The\nfirst is that if the application to strike the plea fails, as it did in this\ncase, protestations of innocence made for the first time at the sentencing\nhearing stage may be viewed with more skepticism than might otherwise be the\ncase.[96]The\nsecond risk is that not putting the best case forward at the time of the\napplication to strike the plea can be expected to reduce the chances of success\nof that application.And if the application fails, the person charged faces a\nsentencing hearing, not a trial.As already noted, a sentencing hearing does\nnot contemplate the same procedural and evidentiary safeguards that a trial\ndoes.Sections 723 and 724 of the Criminal Code make that very clear.At a sentencing hearing, the presiding judge has considerable discretion to\ndecide what information can be relied on and in what form it can be presented.In this case the Crown did not attempt to rely on the relaxed rules of\nevidence.It did not seek to present information to the Court otherwise than\nby in-Court testimony.But it could have.And it would have been within the\nCourt’s discretion to accept evidence presented through other means.[97]Finally,\nat the hearing,I invited submissions from counsel about what should happen if\nI concluded that an essential element of the offence had not been proven to the\nrequisite degree.In answer to that question, counsel referred to various\npossibilities in their submissions (that the matter could be remitted to trial,\nthat a judicial stay of proceedings could be entered, that an acquittal could be\nentered).But the submissions on this point were not particularly detailed and\nno one referred me to any caselaw.As it turned out, given my findings of\nfact, the issue did not arise. I think it is better left to be decided in a\ncase where it actually arises, and with the benefit of full submissions from\ncounsel.V)CONCLUSION[98]These\nwere my reasons for concluding that Mr. M.K.1 sexually assaulted M.K. in the\nmanner that she described in her testimony. Crown and Defence agreed that on the\nbasis of that version of events, this was a major sexual assault within themeaning of R v Arcand, 2010 ABCA\n363 (CanLII) and R v A.J.P.J., 2011 NWTCA 2 (CanLII).In sentencing Mr. M.K.1, I followed\nthe principles outlined in those cases.L.A.\nCharbonneauJ.S.C.Dated\nin Yellowknife, NT this17th\nday of February, 2017Counsel for the Applicant:Alexander\nGodfreyCounsel for the Respondent:Jay BranS-1-CR-2015-000 118IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THENORTHWEST TERRITORIESBETWEEN:HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN-and-M.K.1PublicationBan: Restrictionon Publication: By Court Order, there is a ban on publishing informationthat may identify the person/persons described in this judgment as thecomplainant/witness.See the Criminal Code, s. 486.4.MEMORANDUM OF JUDGMENT(SUPPLEMENTAL REASONS FOLLOWINGSENTENCING HEARING) OFTHE HONOURABLE JUSTICEL.A.

Kellway.................................................................................................................for\nthe CrownP. Abraham..........................................................................................counsel\nfor the accused D.P.BORENSTEIN J.:[1]On August 8, 2008, 17-year-old D.P. was in a\ncar with his two cousins, D.B. and M.B.. They were going to meet Brian Navarro.\nD.B. arranged to sell $1,000.00 worth of marijuana to Mr. Navarro. In reality,\nthis was a set up to rob Mr. Navarro. D.B. and M.B. were in the front seats and\nD.P. was in the back with a sawed-off shotgun.[2]Mr. Navarro and two of his friends pulled up\nin their car to meet D.B.. M.B. got in the back seat next to D.P., and Brian\nNavarro got into the front passenger seat next to D.B.. As Navarro was looking\nat the marijuana, D.P. pulled out the sawed-off shotgun and robbed Mr. Navarro\nof almost a thousand dollars. Mr. Navarro returned to his car. M.B. and D.B.\nand D.P. drove off. Navarro drove after them. M.B. and D.B. fled and got into\nan accident and began to run. The police were on scene and caught D.P.. They\nretrieved the marijuana and the sawed-off shotgun. The shotgun was real but was\nunloaded. A sawed-off shotgun is a prohibited weapon.[3]This robbery occurred eight days before D.P.\nturned 18. D.B., his cousin, had turned 18 about two months before the robbery.\nM.B. was 27 and, according to the Crown, did not really participate in the\nrobbery. It was D.B. who knew Brian Navarro and it was D.P. who used the sawed-off\nshotgun to commit this robbery.[4]18-year-old D.B. pled guilty to the robbery,\nuse of prohibited weapon and possession for the purpose of trafficking.There\nis a five-year minimum sentence for robbery with a prohibited firearm. D.B.,\nwho was just 18 and had no prior record, received a sentence of five years and\n45 days for the robbery charge and a concurrent sentence of six months for the\npossession for the purpose of trafficking charge for a total sentence of 5\nyears and 45 days.[5]Mr. D.P. set his case down for trial. On the\ntrial date, with the witnesses present, he changed his mind and pled guilty to robbery\nwhile armed with a sawed-off .12 gauge shotgun, possession of that same firearm\nwithout being the holder of a licence, and careless transporting of that\nfirearm.[6]D.P. had been in custody for two weeks prior\nto his release on bail. He was under house arrest but was allowed out for\ncounselling. He had a prior criminal record for dangerous driving from 2007,\nfor which he received probation.Impact of offence on the victim[7]Mr. Navarro provided a victim-impact\nstatement. It is quite understated in my view. He is 30 years old and feels\nless safe as a result of this offence. He knew the accused D.B. and felt safe\nknowing that D.B. was in custody. I point out that it was D.P. who had the\ngun.One can only imagine how terrifying it would be to be in a car when\nsomeone pulls out a sawed-off shotgun to rob you. It is conceded by the defence\nthat anyone robbed in these circumstances would be terrified.[8]This guilty plea came very late in the process\n– on the trial date. The victim had to come to Court to face the person who\npulled a gun on him. It was only when the case was about to proceed that the\nguilty plea was entered. The matter was adjourned for sentencing. Then, the\ndefence was not prepared to accept the victim impact statement due to an obvious\ntypographical error. As a result, the victim was told he had to come to Court\nto testify as to the impact of the crime. He came to Court to testify and it\nwas only then that the defence accepted the victim-impact statement without the\nneed for the victim to testify.Crown and Defence sentencing positions[9]The Crown seeks a designation that this was\na serious violent offence. They seek an 18-month sentence comprised of 12\nmonths’ closed custody followed by six months’ community supervision, followed\nby probation, as well as a DNA order and a 10-year weapons prohibition pursuant\nto section. 51(1). Finally, the Crown seeks an order that the shotgun and the\nmarijuana be destroyed.[10]The defence seeks a deferred custody and\nsupervision order. They resist the SVO designation. If I designate this as a Serious\nViolent offence, then deferred custody is not a legally available sentence.[11]It is clear from both the Crown and defence\nsubmissions that both counsel believe some form of custodial sentence is\nwarranted in this case. This was a violent offence.Background of D.P.[12]Almost all of the information I learned\nabout D.P. came directly from the pre-sentence report and therefore I will\nreview it extensively.[13]D.P. is now 19 years old. He was just eight days\naway from turning 18 when he committed this serious offence with his cousins. D.P.\nand his older sister lived with their grandparents in Mississauga next door to\ntheir parents.[14]D.P.’s grandfather was in a wheelchair and D.P.\nhelped him manage. His grandfather died in 2007 and that was traumatic for D.P..\nIt was shortly after his death that D.P. committed the dangerous driving\noffence on his record, which he describes as joy riding to the author of the pre-sentence\nreport.[15]About a month before the robbery, D.P.’s\nfather lost his job and his parents moved in with their grandmother. D.P. helps\ncare for his mother who has multiple sclerosis.[16]According to the pre-sentence report, D.P.\ncame from a household with strict rules and D.P. followed those rules and was\nnever in a fight. His family describe him as compassionate, helpful and\nrespectful.[17]D.P. was diagnosed with attention deficit\ndisorder at age 6 and was given Ritalin until Grade 7 or 8. He had difficulties\nin school with reading comprehension. As a result, he changed high schools\nseveral times but was able to successfully complete Grade 12. Due to the fact\nthat he was on a career path rather than the academic stream, he earned a\nCertificate as opposed to a high school diploma. He told the author of the pre-sentence\nthat his marks were generally in the 60’s and 70’s. Like much of the\npre-sentence report, the author seems to rely exclusively on D.P.’s\nself-reporting or that of his parents and that holds true with respect to how D.P.\ndid in school. D.P. apparently wants to obtain his full high school diploma and\nhas an interest in the hospitality industry.[18]D.P. worked part time on occasion in 2007\nand 2008.[19]The author of the pre-sentence report writes\nof D.P.’s talents in sports and states that D.P. is well liked in his community\nand often helps neighbours.[20]As for D.P.’s role in this offence, the\nauthor of the pre-sentence report writes as follows:D.P. expresses appreciation that this\noffence occurred just prior to his 18th birthday. He takes\nresponsibility for his actions, as an accessory, as a party to the offence and\ndoes not justify or excuse his behaviour. D.P. feels hurt and betrayed by his\ntwo cousins whom he feels led him into his current behaviour. D.P. was also\nsaddened by the fact that he was in detention during his last birthday and\nnever got a birthday cake.[21]The author notes that D.P.’s parents feel\nthe house arrest has been enough of a lesson to D.P. and he now just wants to\nmove on with his life.[22]D.P.’s mother believes that counselling\nwould help D.P. reintegrate into the community after a year of house arrest and\nto help him deal with his feelings of disappointment at being let down by his\ncousins. The author writes that D.P. is “adamant” that he does not want\ncounselling because he feels there is a stigma attached to counselling.[23]The author is supportive of D.P.’s interest\nin the hospitality industry due do his good manners and friendliness.[24]The author makes reference to various\ncommunity programs that she thinks may benefit D.P., including a five-session\nvictim-impact awareness program that is available to young people who do not\npose a risk to the community. Elizabeth Fry offers a cognitive skills program\nto help young people learn about the choices they make and their consequences.\nThere is a tutoring service that can help people with learning disabilities and\nemployment resource centre that can help people find jobs.[25]The author of the pre-sentence report concludes\nby stating that both the current offence as well as the previous one took place\nafter family trauma. She notes that D.P. is described as well liked by his\nfamily and that the offence was out of character. She concludes that D.P. is\namenable to community service and that his“… manners and personality would make him a\ngood candidate to help at community special events. Community service would\naddress reparation to the community and would be meaningful to the youth. This\nwriter therefore respectfully submits that a community sentence would be\nsufficient to hold the youth accountable for his actions”.[26]This is a positive pre-sentence report to be\nsure. D.P. impressed the author, particularly with his manners and his\npersonality. On the other hand, it is obvious that she relied almost\nexclusively on the self-reporting of D.P. and his parents. It does not appear\nthat she looked at records from school to verify any information. While it is a\npositive pre-sentence report and will be treated as such, the overall report\nstrikes me as too reliant on self reporting. Moreover, the comments about D.P.\ntaking full responsibility for his crime are somewhat at odds with his own\ncomments referred to in the report. The report seems to gloss over obvious\nareas of concern.[27]I have not been provided with any real\nexplanation as to what led D.P. to participate in this crime, other than\nstress. Perhaps more importantly, I have not been provided with any insight as\nto what, if anything, D.P. has learned over the last two years. He has not\nenrolled in any counselling despite his bail containing an exception to house\narrest for the purpose of counselling. Although he has not re-offended and has\ncomplied with his house arrest, which is commendable, there is little else\nbefore me to help me understand what led D.P. to commit this offence or what\nmay assist him in moving forward in life in a positive way.[28]I have also heard from D.P. directly and he\nimpresses me as remorseful, despite the plea on the trial date and the refusal\nto accept the victim-impact statement without hearing from the victim and then\nthe agreement to its contents once the case was adjourned and the victim\nre-attended.[29]The defence argues he is young, remorseful\nand ripe for rehabilitation and has the support of his family and his\ncommunity.[30]Since his release, he has made one\nappointment for counselling. Even though his bail had him under house arrest\nunless he was in counselling, he did not seek or participate in counselling.\nWhen asked why, his lawyer explained that the family did not think he was allowed\nout for counselling. I reject that as an explanation. The bail is clear. They\nwere represented by counsel. There is no valid reason before me.Mitigating and aggravating factors[31]In brief, the main aggravating factor is the\nnature and circumstances of this offence. Three men lured the victim into a car\nand pulled out a sawed-off shotgun to rob him. While, fortunately, the gun was\nnot loaded, the victim would not have known that and the matter would naturally\nbe terrifying. Carrying a sawed-off shotgun and using it in the way it was used\nis at the high end of criminal activity. That it was committed by three men in\nconcert makes it worse.[32]The 18-year-old cousin, who did not brandish\nthe gun, and did not have a criminal record, received a sentence of over five years.\nThe five year minimum for an adult reflects Parliament’s view of the extremely\nserious nature of this crime.[33]By way of mitigation, there is D.P.'s’s age.\nAlthough he has a record, it is, relatively speaking, minor. He pled guilty.\nPleas of guilt not only spare the victim from testifying and save Court time, they\nare usually a demonstration of remorse. In this case, D.P. was arrested on\nscene. The gun was still there. He pled guilty on the trial date. These facts\nlessen the remorse that might be inferred from a guilty plea.It came on the\ntrial date on an obviously very strong Crown case where the accused was\narrested on the scene. Nonetheless, it is still an expression of some remorse.\nFurther, I heard from D.P. himself and I do accept that he is remorseful.[34]His family is supportive and loving and that\nbodes well for his future and operates positively in this case as does the\npre-sentence report. He has been on house arrest and he will be given credit\nfor that. He complied with his bail and that is positive, although he has not\nsought to do anything productive since his release.Serious Violent Offence Designation[35]The Crown submits that this is a serious\nviolent offence and I should designate it as such pursuant to section 42 (9) of\nthe Youth Criminal Justice Act.The onus is on the Crown to establish\nthat this is an SVO beyond a reasonable doubt.[36]The defence submits that it is not a serious\nviolent offence. In the alternative, even if it is, I should exercise my\ndiscretion not to designate it as a SVO for doing so would preclude a sentence\nof deferred custody which the defence submits is appropriate.[37]Both counsel agree that I have a discretion\nto not designate the offence an SVO even if it would qualify as such.[38]The primary effect of an SVO designation in\nthis case would be to render unavailable a deferred custody and supervision sentence.If I designate this as an SVO, then deferred custody is not a legally available\nsentence.[39]Section 2 of the YCJA defines a\nserious violent offence as “an offence in the commission of which a young\nperson causes or attempts to cause serious bodily harm”.Serious bodily\nharm is not defined in the YCJA; however, s. 2(2) provides that words\nused in the YCJA carry the same meaning as in the Criminal Code\nunless otherwise provided.[40]The Supreme Court in R. v. McCraw\n(1991) defined “serious bodily harm” as “any hurt or injury, whether\nphysical or psychological, that interferes in a substantial way with the\nphysical or psychological integrity, health or well-being of the complainant”.[41]In R. v. C.D. (2005), the Supreme\nCourt adopted that same definition for the purposes of defining “serious\nviolent offence” in s. 2(1) of the YCJA , holding that there was “no\nreason why this definition of ‘serious bodily harm’ should not also be used for\npurposes of the YCJA, and, in particular, for purposes of the definition of\n‘serious violent offence’ that is found in s. 2(1) of the Act”.[42]Accordingly, a serious violent offence under\nthe YCJA is an offence in the commission of which a young person causes\nor attempts to cause serious bodily harm – meaning, any hurt or\ninjury, whether physical or psychological, that interferes in a substantial way\nwith the physical or psychological integrity, health or well-being of the\ncomplainant.[43]In my view, this was a serious violent\noffence. While it is true that no physical harm was caused or intended,\nI have no doubt that pulling a sawed-off shotgun on someone in a car for the\npurpose of robbing him was an act intended to terrify and to threaten and is an\nattempt to cause serious psychological harm. The defence concedes that any\nvictim would be terrified having a shotgun pulled on them anywhere, including\nin the close confines of a car. That was the precise intention: cause the\nvictim to believe he may be killed so that he would turn over his money.The\nfact that the victim-impact statement downplays the harm does not detract from\nthe accused’s intention.[44]This was a serious violent offence. I will\ndesignate it as such. The pre-mediated nature of this crime, the bringing of a\nsawed-off shotgun into a car, the luring of the victim into the car to be\nrobbed, surrounded by three people, brandishing a sawed-off shotgun, were all\nacts meant to threaten to cause harm or death to the victim lest he comply.\nThat the accused’s actions would terrify any victim is conceded and was\nforeseeable. That was the point of producing the gun. The only reason suggested\nby the defence to exercise my discretion not to declare this crime an SVO is\nthat it would render a deferred custody and supervision order unavailable. It\nis not clear to me that that is an appropriate consideration. It is somewhat circular\nand would entirely nullify Parliament’s direction that deferred custody is unavailable\nwith respect to serious violent offences. In any event, the other factors\nrelating to the nature of this offence outweigh that consideration. I will\ndesignate this offence an SVO. Accordingly, a deferred custody and supervision\norder is unavailable. In my view, even if it were available, it would not be an\nappropriate sentence in this case.[45]What is the appropriate sentence bearing in\nmind the principles of sentencing in the YCJA?[46]Just because custody is an available\nsentence does not necessarily mean that it is required or appropriate.\nSentencing under the YCJA is significantly different than sentencing under\nthe Criminal Code. The purpose of sentencing is to hold the young person\naccountable for the offence by imposing just sanctions that have meaningful\nconsequences to the young person that promote his rehabilitation and\nreintegration into society. The focus of sentencing is to protect society\nthrough an attempt to rehabilitate and reintegrate the youth back into the\ncommunity. The sentence must be the least-restrictive sentence capable of\nachieving the purpose of sentencing and must be proportionate to the\nseriousness of the offence and the offender’s degree of responsibility.Deterrence\n– be it specific or general – are not considerations on sentencing under the YCJA\nthough that may still be an effect of a just sentence. To quote the 2009\ndecision of R. v. K.L. by our Court of Appeal, “at bottom, [the]\nsentence must be proportionate to the seriousness of the offence and the degree\nof [the young person’s] responsibility”.[47]Mr. D.P. is now 19 years old. He committed\nthis offence eight days before his 18th birthday. Had he committed\nit just about one week later, he would have faced a minimum five-year sentence\nas his cousin did.It is ironic that two boys who grew up together and who\nare, for all intents and purposes, the same age, and who committed this offence\ntogether, with the accused being the one who brandished the gun – facing such\ndisparate sentences. It is unfair. Is parity something that I can consider\nunder the YCJA? I am expressly required to consider parity in relation\nto other young persons. But what about his cousin D.B.?[48]In the 2008 decision of the Ontario Court of\nAppeal in R. v. Wobbes, O.J. 2999, an adult offender argued on appeal\nthat his sentence should be reduced due to the lesser sentence imposed on a\nyoung person who had committed the offence with him. The court rejected that\nargument holding that the sentencing regime under the YCJA was\ncompletely different than under the Criminal Code, notably, that\ndeterrence was not a consideration and that the YCJA placed mandatory\nrestrictions on the use of custody.[49]This case approaches parity from the\nopposite end from the Wobbes case but the principle is the same. Parity with\nan adult is not a consideration. Nonetheless, the five-year minimum for this\noffence for an adult does reflect how seriously Parliament considers this crime\nand is relevant to the overall proportionality assessment of a just sentence.[50]The Crown has submitted a variety of cases\nwhere custodial sentences have been imposed upon young people who commit\nrobberies with guns.[51]The 2009 Ontario Court of Appeal decision in\nR. v. J.S., O.J. No. 812, in particularly instructive. In that case, J.S.\nand another youth wore masks and robbed a lone storekeeper in a convenience\nstore. J.S. threatened the storekeeper with an imitation handgun. His\naccomplice was armed with a knife. The sentencing judge sentenced J.S. to 12\nmonths’ probation and declined to make a DNA Order. On appeal, the Court found\nthe sentence was unfit and failed to recognize the seriousness of the offence\nand failed to properly address the requirement that J.S. be held accountable\nfor his actions and that meaningful consequences flow from the sentence. The Court\nof Appeal held that, ordinarily, such offences would attract a significant\ncustodial sentence, even for a youth. However, in light of what the Court of Appeal\ncalled J.S’s “exceptional” rehabilitative progress, they imposed a deferred custody\nand supervision order.[52]There are similarities and differences\nbetween the J.S. case and D.P.’s. Obviously a storekeeper is a different\nand more vulnerable victim than in our case but the basic principles in J.S.\nstill apply.In this case, I agree with the Crown that not breaching one’s\nbail, while commendable, is not exceptional progress. Where is the progress, or\ninsight, or counselling or anything in this case. There is a complete absence\nof information as to what D.P. has done over the last two years. There is no\nplan proposed. There is nothing demonstrating insight or progress.[53]Clearly, a custodial sentence is available\npursuant to section 39(1)(a) and is warranted. It is a violent offence. In\nfact, the submissions of both counsel revolve around a custodial sentence, the\ndefence just submits that deferred or open custody would be sufficient in the\ncircumstances.[54]This sentence must be the least restrictive\nsentence possible but must also be proportional to the seriousness of the\noffence and must hold D.P. accountable for his crime.[55]Having considered all of the above and the\npersonal circumstances of D.P., and trying to impose the least restrictive\nsentence available that would hold D.P. accountable, it is my view that a 12 month\ncustody and supervision order is appropriate in this case to be followed by\nprobation. That means, he will be in custody for eight months followed by four\nmonths of community supervision.[56]In my view, open custody would be more\nappropriate in this case than closed custody. The first eight months of the\nsentence will be served in open custody followed by four months of community\nsupervision. I do not see the need or the benefit of placing D.P. in closed\ncustody. I am also taking into account the fact that he has already been on\nhouse arrest for almost two years without incident. Following the custody and\nsupervision portion of his sentence, D.P. will be placed on probation for one\nyear. He is to report to a youth officer. He will be subject to the mandatory\nterms of probation. In addition, he will take and participate in any\ncounselling that may be recommended to him by his youth worker and he is to\nsign all releases to enable his youth worker to monitor his compliance with\nthis term. He will not possess any weapons as defined by the Criminal Code.\nHe will have no contact with the victim or with D.B. or M.B.. He will attend\nschool or seek and maintain employment and provide proof to his youth worker.[57]He will be subject to a 10-year weapons\nprohibition and there will be an Order destroying the marijuana and the shotgun\nin this case. There will be an order that he provide a sample of his DNA.[58]Finally, I am concerned about the potential\napplication of section 93 of the YCJA, which permits the Provincial\nDirector to transfer Mr. D.P. from open custody to an adult facility upon\nturning 20. Accordingly, I invite D.P. to bring an application for a sentencing\nreview prior to his 20th birthday. If he is doing well, that would\nenable me to consider a variation of the sentence and the Provincial Director’s\nviews.Released:March 9, 2010Signed: “Justice Borenstein”"}

C-46)Porter,\nP.C.J.Introduction[1]These are the reasons for sentence for offences of\nhaving possession of child pornography [Criminal Code s. 163.1(4)] and\nalso of having used a computer system to communicate with a person under the\nage of 18 years for the purpose of facilitating the commission of an offence [Criminal\nCode s. 172.1(1)(a)]. Both charges were prosecuted summarily.[2]The full particulars of the commission of the offences\nat Bar have been reported, at R. v. Brown, [2015] N.J. No. 402 (P.C.),\nand so need not be reproduced here. In brief, over the span of several weeks, the\naccused used a series of text messages to persuade a young teenaged girl to\ntake photographs of herself, and to send them to him. When he was arrested on\nan unrelated matter, his cell phone was examined, and found to contain these\npictures.[3]Counsel agree that the 2012 amendments to the statutory\nprovisions require that the accused be sentenced between a minimum of 90 days,\nand a maximum of 18 months in custody.The\npositions of the parties on the custodial part of the sentence[4]The parties took very different positions on sentence.\nThe Crown suggested a sentence of a year, while the accused said a minimum sentence\nof 90 days, concurrent, would be a reasonable disposition. Given the disparity,\nit will be useful here to briefly summarize the arguments made in support of\nthe respective positions.[5]For the Crown, Mr. Patten cited Criminal Code s. 718.01,\nR. v. Rice, 2012\nCarswellNfld 479 (P.C.), and R. v. Keeping, [2013] N.J. No. 336 (P.C.).\nLet me discuss these in that order.[6]S. 718.01 of the Criminal Code provides as\nfollows:718.01 When a court imposes a\nsentence for an offence that involved the abuse of a person under the age of\neighteen years, it shall give primary consideration to the objectives of\ndenunciation and deterrence of such conduct.[7]The\nvictim of the child pornography in this case was 13 years old when the\ncommunication with the accused started, and she had her 14th\nbirthday a few weeks after that. It follows that s. 718.01 applies.[8]In\nR. v. Rice, 2012 CarswellNfld 479 (P.C.), a 37 year old man had\nestablished a relationship witha 16-year-old boy through a video game and\nthen pursued other contact by social media and cell phone. The accused had\nexchanged erotica with complainant and gave him nude pictures of a young boy\nbefore asking for pictures from him. The accused pleaded guilty to internet\nluring, possession of child pornography and distributing child pornography.\nThe trial judge sentenced the accused to a global sentence of 22 months,\nincluding one year for distribution of child pornography to be served\nconcurrently and four months for possession of child pornography, and gave\ncredit of 88 days for time served.[9]There\nare a several things to note about R. v. Keeping, [2013] N.J. No. 336 (P.C.).\nFirst, it was arguably a more serious offence than the matter at Bar, because\nthe naked photographs of the victim in that case had been put on the internet\nby the accused. Second, it was a matter where there was a joint submission for\na shorter sentence than now being sought by the Crown. Third, the joint\nsubmission was rejected, and, fourth, the decision rejecting the joint\nsubmission was overturned on appeal to the Summary Conviction Appeal Court: see\nR. v. Keeping, [2014] N.J. No. 381 (SCTD).[10]As\na result, the trial level decision in Keeping has limited utility, other\nthan to point to the position of the Crown, i.e., that a minimum sentence was\nappropriate in a case of a small number of child pornography pictures. The end\nresult, after the summary conviction appeal court decision, was a sentence of\n118 days, being made up of 14 days imprisonment for possession of child pornography; 14 days\nconsecutive for a second count of possession; and 90 days consecutive for\ndistribution.[11]The\nCrown took the position that a sentence of 7 to 8 months would be appropriate\nfor the “luring” offence, and that a consecutive sentence, of 4 to 5 months,\nwas appropriate for the possession charge. These sentences ought to be made\nconsecutive, with the result being a range of sentence of between 11 to 13\nmonths in custody.[12]For\nthe accused, Mr. Evans, Q.C., pointed out the fact that the victim was not the\norigin of the police file, in that the police had found the photographs on the\ncell phone while reviewing it for evidence in relation to a drug offence.\nFurther, said counsel for the accused, the accused had not made the\nphotographs. The victim had made them, and had sent them to the accused. I\nhasten to add here that she did this after persistent demands for the\nphotographs made by the accused.[13]Mr.\nEvans, Q.C., pointed out that all of this happened two years ago, and that a\nlot of changes had been made by the accused. The pre-sentence report was\nexceptionally positive, he said, and clearly set out how the accused had turned\nhis life around. The accused had been living a criminal lifestyle, selling\ndrugs to supplement his fishing income, when he had committed these offences.\nNow, two years later, the accused was the group leader in a local chapter of\nNarcotics Anonymous. While he is not working at present, he does expect to\nreturn to work in the fishery later this year.[14]Counsel\nfor the accused pointed to the fact that the accused had been caught with drugs\nin February, 2014, and had been sentenced, in July 2014, for that offence.\nSince the photographs had been made and transmitted to him between December\n2013 and February 2014, the present offences were actually his first offences,\nand so he ought to be sentenced as a first offender.[15]Counsel\nfor the accused also took the position that these two offences were committed\nsimultaneously, and therefore amounted to a single “criminal adventure”, as\nthat term is used in R.\nv. Crocker, 1991 No.172 (NL CA). As a result, the\nappropriate sentence should be two concurrent terms of 90 days in custody.[16]When the Criminal\nCode s. 726 allocution was put to the accused, he said that he was sorry,\nand that he would like to apologize to the victim. He also said that he has\nchanged his life.Analysis[17]Objectively,\nin getting these photographs and storing them on his cell phone, the accused\nwas not committing as serious an offence as the offences committed by Keeping,\nbecause Keeping had put the photographs of his victim on the internet.\nFurther, the Supreme Court, Trial Division, endorsed a minimum sentence for the\noffences committed by Keeping. In that context, it is difficult to\nunderstand the change in the position taken by the Crown.[18]Furthermore,\nthe Supreme Court, Trial Division has already accepted that the accused at Bar\nhas made significant positive changes to his life. On July 30, 2015, the\naccused was sentenced by the Supreme Court for his role in causing a\ndisturbance, as part of a melee in Marystown on June 4, 2014. That decision is\nreported at R.\nv. Brown, [2015]\nN.J. No. 261 (SCTD).[19]The\nantecedents of the accused, with both date of offence and date of conviction,\nare set out in a chart at paragraph 8 of that decision. All of the offences\nwere committed in February, 2014, i.e., after the commission of the\noffences at Bar. The mitigating factors, which are also relevant to this\nmatter, are set out in paragraph 13 of that decision, and include the\nfollowing:He is still a young\nman, and \"technically\" a first offender.He graduated high\nschool, acquired a trade and has worked in the fishing industry for the last five\nyears.He is an industrious\nworker and his fishing employer values his services.He is a member of\nboth Narcotics Anonymous and Alcoholics Anonymous and is committed to\nabstaining from alcohol and drug use.His parents support\nhim and they are committed to his welfare but condemn his criminal behavior.He complied with past\ncourt orders requiring supervision, he introduced meaningful changes to his\nlifestyle since he was arrested in June 2014 and he remains open to any\ninterventions that may be required in the future.[20]Given\nthe sentence in Keeping, and taking into account the successful efforts\nmade by the accused to rehabilitate himself, the position advocated by counsel\nfor the accused is endorsed. Accordingly, the sentence for each offence is 90\ndays in custody.[21]The\noffences were committed together, and are so closely intertwined that they\namount to a single criminal adventure. As a result, the sentences will be\nserved concurrently.Ancillary\norders[22]Counsel\nagree that there are ancillary orders, as follows:1)SOIRA order for ten\nyears, based on Ss. 490.011(1)(a)(viii) and 490.013(2)(a) of the Criminal\nCode;2)DNA order, as a result\nof s. 487.04(a) of the Criminal Code;3)Forfeiture of the cell\nphone containing the photographs, pursuant to s. 164.2 of the Criminal Code;\nand4)Probation.[23]Before\nsetting out the probation conditions, the issue of the s. 161 order requires\ndiscussion. Crown counsel requested a s. 161 order. It is not mandatory in this\ncase. The accused at Bar has never met the victim of his crimes. While it is\npossible that they could meet inadvertently, keeping him away from her does not\nrequire a s. 161 order. That can be achieved through the provisions of a\nprobation order. There is no reason to believe that it is necessary to prohibit\nthe accused from going to parks or swimming pools in order to protect the\npublic. Since I am not persuaded that a s.161 order is necessary, it is not\nordered.[24]S.\n731.1 of the Criminal Code requires that before making a probation\norder, the court shall consider whether section 109 or 110 is applicable. There\nis no reason to make any order prohibiting the accused from possession of\nfirearms, ammunition, or explosive substances.[25]Following\nhis release from custody, the accused will be on probation for two years. The\nprobation conditions include the following1.keep the peace and be\nof good behaviour;2.advise the court or\nthe probation officer of any change of name, address or occupation;3.abstain from\ncommunicating, directly or indirectly, with the victim;4.report to a probation\nofficer within two working days after release from custody, and thereafter,\nwhen required by the probation officer and in the manner directed by the\nprobation officer;5.attend any counselling\nrecommended by the probation officer.Conclusion[26]The accused persuaded a young teen to take nude pictures\nof herself and to send them electronically. The pictures were discovered when\nthe police searched his cell phone incidental to his arrest for drug offences.\nThere was no evidence that the photographs had been distributed, put on the\ninternet, or even shown to anyone else.[27]At the time of the commission of these offences, the\naccused was a first offender. The pre-sentence report was exceptionally\npositive, and it was clear that the accused had already made significant\nprogress in his rehabilitation.[28]As a result, the minimum sentences were imposed, as well\nas a number of ancillary orders.Porter, P.C.J."}

The\nconviction stems from the fact that, on June 4th, 2014, the Offender\nentered Canada through Pearson International Airport with approximately 3.9\nkilograms of opium hidden in the false bottoms of two suitcases.[2]I\nam required to determine the appropriate sentence for this offence.Facts[3]The\nOffender was born in Iran, but has lived in Canada since 1991.He has moved\nback and forth between Canada and Iran regularly starting in 2010, as he was\nresponsible for running the family business after his father passed away.[4]The\nOffender travelled from Toronto to Turkey on May 31st, 2014,\narriving in Istanbul on June 1st, 2014.He purchased his ticket for\ncash at the airport.He spent three nights at a hotel in Istanbul, and met up\nwith a woman that he knew, Sanaz Poursiamak.He testified that the purpose of\nthis trip was to consider exploring a clothing business, although he did not\nprovide a lot of details about this business.[5]Ms.\nPoursiamak did not testify in this trial.She had been known to the Offender\nfrom the time he dated her sister for six months back in 2009. The Offender\nbecame a friend of one of Ms. Poursiamak’s cousins, but had no contact with Ms.\nPoursiamak between 2009 and 2013. There was an incident in 2013 where Ms.\nPoursiamak was detained at Pearson because there was opium in an amount for\npersonal use in her possession. The Offender was aware that Ms. Poursiamak was\nan opium user.[6]The\nOffender was also aware that Ms. Poursiamak owned a spa in Canada, and had been\nexporting beauty products into Iran.As a result of this export business, Ms.\nPoursiamak had been generating large amounts of currency in small bills that\nshe needed to move to Canada. The Offender testified that there were\nrestrictions on what currency could be taken out of Iran and, as a result, Ms.\nPoursiamak could not move this currency openly.[7]When\nthey met up in Turkey, Ms. Poursiamak provided the Offender with two suitcases.\nBoth contained sealed packages that were placed in false bottoms of the\nsuitcases. The Offender testified that he believed he was transporting $80,000.00\nin currency that had been generated by Ms. Poursiamak’s spa business in Iran\nfrom Turkey to Canada.[8]The\nOffender testified that he was to be paid $15,000.00 plus expenses to bring\nthis $80,000.00 in currency across the border, and that he was certain it was\ncurrency because he inspected the sealed packages and they were firm, much like\ncurrency would be if it was in a package.The Offender was aware that the\npenalty for bringing in more than $10,000.00 in currency was a fine, and the\npotential confiscation of the money.[9]The\nOffender flew into Pearson Airport on June 4th, 2014 on the same\nflight as Ms. Poursiamak.He went through his initial screening at customs\nwith Officer Matthew Schrock. Officer Schrock determined that Mr. Asl should\nattend a secondary inspection, and marked his customs declaration card\naccordingly.The Offender then went downstairs to the baggage carousel and had\na conversation with Ms. Poursiamak.He then went to the washroom, encountered\nOfficer Schrock there, and went to secondary inspection.[10]In\nthe secondary inspection area, Officer Schrock emptied the Offender’s\nsuitcases, which included both his clothing and Ms. Poursiamak’s clothing.He\nnoticed an anomaly in the suitcases, and had them x-rayed. Officer Schrock then\npunctured the packaging and tested it, confirming that it was opium.[11]The\nweight of the opium was 3.9047 kilograms.The evidence established that the\nopium had a street value at the kilogram level of $88,000.00, at the ounce\nlevel of $111,000.00 and at the gram level of $117,000.00.[12]As\nis clear from the foregoing, the Offender testified.The jury’s verdict makes\nit clear that they rejected the Offender’s evidence, and it did not leave them\nin a state of reasonable doubt.The\nOffender[13]The\nOffender was born in Tehran, Iran and is currently 43 years old.He lived in\nTurkey for a period of time, and came to Canada in 1991. He is a Canadian\ncitizen.He has two sisters, one older and one younger.His parents were\nmarried until his father’s passing in 2010.His father owned a construction\ncompany.[14]The\nOffender became responsible for managing the construction company when his\nfather passed away in 2010, and has been travelling back and forth between Iran\nand Canada on a regular basis as a result of his responsibilities to the\nbusiness.[15]The\nOffender has a good relationship with his mother, and with both of his sisters.\nThe Offender is married, and his wife, who is from Iran, is a medical student\nwho is working towards completion of her medical exams so that she can obtain her\nmedical licence in Ontario.[16]The\nOffender is not a user of opium or of other drugs, and has no addiction issues\nthat I was made aware of.Mitigating\nFactors[17]The\nmitigating factors in this case are:a)The\nOffender is a mature first-time Offender.b)The\nOffender has a supportive family network, and has been a productive member of\nthe community.Aggravating\nFactors[18]The\naggravating factors in this case are more complex. One of the key factors that\nthe Crown argues is aggravating is the role that the Offender played in this\nimportation scheme.Specifically, the Crown argues that the Offender was not a\nmere courier, but a principal in this scheme.[19]The\nDefence, on the other hand, argues that the accused was a courier, and was simply\nwillfully blind to what he was importing into the country. The question of\nwhether the Offender was a mere courier or a principal in the operation is\nrelated to, but distinct from, the question of whether he actually knew what\nthe substance was, or whether he was a willfully blind courier.[20]Part\nof the defence’s argument was that, since the jury was instructed on willful\nblindness, I am required to adopt the interpretation of the jury’s verdict that\nis most favourable to the Offender.As a result, the defence argues that I\nshould simply find that the accused was a willfully blind courier (with no\nadditional knowledge of the importation scheme), and should sentence him on\nthat basis.[21]I\nreject this argument. In doing so, I note the Supreme Court of Canada’s\ndecision in R. v. Ferguson (2008 SCC 6 (CanLII)). In that decision, McLachlin\nC.J.C. states (at paragraphs 16 to 18):[16] This poses a difficulty in a\ncase such as this, since, unlike a judge sitting alone, who has a duty to give\nreasons, the jury gives only its ultimate verdict.The sentencing judge\ntherefore must do his or her best to determine the facts necessary for\nsentencing from the issues before the jury and from the jury’s verdict. This\nmay not require the sentencing judge to arrive at a complete theory of the\nfacts; the sentencing judge is required to make only those factual\ndeterminations necessary for deciding the appropriate sentence in the case at\nhand.[17] Two principles govern the\nsentencing judge in this endeavour. First, the sentencing judge “is bound by\nthe express and implied factual implications of the jury’s verdict”:R. v. Brown, 1991 CanLII 73 (SCC), [1991] 2 S.C.R.\n518, p. 523. The sentencing judge “shall accept as proven all facts, express or\nimplied, that are essential to the jury’s verdict of guilty” (Criminal\nCode , s.\n724(2) (a)),\nand must not accept as fact any evidence consistent only with a verdict\nrejected by the jury: Brown; R. v. Braun (1995), 95C.C.C. (3d) 443 (Man.\nC.A.).[18] Second, when the factual\nimplications of the jury’s verdict are ambiguous, the sentencing judge should\nnot attempt to follow the logical process of the jury, but should come to his\nor her own independent determination of the relevant facts: Brown; R. v. Fiqia (1994), 1994 ABCA 402 (CanLII), 162 A.R. 117 (C.A.).In\nso doing, the sentencing judge “may find any other relevant fact that was\ndisclosed by evidence at the trial to be proven”[22]Given\nthis direction from the Supreme Court, and the differences in the arguments of\nthe parties, I must resolve both the question of whether the accused had actual\nknowledge, and whether the accused was a mere courier, or was more principally\ninvolved in the importation scheme. If he did not have actual knowledge, then\nit is more likely than not he was just a courier.[23]Part\nof my instruction to the jury on willful blindness made it clear that wilful\nblindness is imputed knowledge, and that it is deliberate ignorance.[24]There\nis not a great deal of difference, if any, between the sentence for someone who\nis wilfully blind and someone who has actual knowledge.Indeed, in R. v.\nSidhu (2009 ONCA 81 (CanLII)), the Court of Appeal stated (at paragraph 17) that wilful\nblindness, rather than actual knowledge, was not a mitigating circumstance.[25]However,\ngiven that the Offender is arguing that he was both wilfully blind and a\ncourier, I must resolve the issue of whether he had actual knowledge in order\nto address the question of whether he was solely a courier in this case.If\nthe offender was wilfully blind, then he can only be a courier.However, if he\nhad actual knowledge he could be either a courier or a principal.[26]I\nfind, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the Offender actually knew that there was\nopium in the packages, rather than being willfully blind.I reach this\nconclusion for the following reasons:a)The\namount of money ($15,000.00 plus expenses) that the Offender claims he was being\npaid to bring $80,000.00 of currency into Canada does not fit with the risks\nassociated with currency smuggling, which the accused himself acknowledged were\nat most a small fine and the confiscation of the money, which was\nnot his.b)The\nexplanation of smuggling currency itself makes no logical sense.It is simply\nunbelievable that the Offender would be paid nearly 20 percent of the value of\nthe currency to bring it in person when it could have been transferred electronically\nfrom a Bank in Turkey. It must be remembered that, although Iran has\nrestrictions on transferring U.S. dollars out of the country, the accused\nacknowledged that Turkey does not have such restrictions.c)The\naccused was well aware that Ms. Poursiamak was an opium user and had been\ncaught at the border with opium in her possession before.[27]Based\non the foregoing, I find beyond a reasonable doubt that the offender knew he\nwas smuggling opium into the country rather than cash.[28]This\nbrings me to the question of whether the Offender was a courier, or had a more\nprincipal role in the importation scheme.This issue was considered in detail\nby Hill J. in R. v. Holder (1998 CanLII 14962 (ON SC), [1998] O.J. No. 5102).In that decision,\nHill J. stated (at paragraphs 34 and 35):[34] It is not apparent from the\nverdict of the jury as to whether Ms. Holder was a courier or a principal\nacting on her own behalf.This is an issue which frequently arises in cases\ninvolving unlawful importation of a narcotic or a controlled drug or substance.If indeed the offender is a courier, it is seen uniformly as being a mitigating\ncircumstance in sentencing.In these circumstances, the accused is viewed as a\nlesser player in the organization, an employee, a “runner”, or a “mule”.A\nprincipal on the other hand, is one who is a more active participant, more\nsubstantially involved, likely to receive more profit and certainly more\nintricately involved in domestic sub-distribution of the narcotic or controlled\nsubstance.[35] As stated in R v. Bishop\n(April 24, 1998), Hill J. (Ont. Gen. Div.)(unreported) at pages 4-5, the\nappropriate starting reference point is that a convicted importer is a\nprincipal.This is a presumption that can be rebutted by an accused\nindividual.The facts relating to the circumstances of the importation are, of\ncourse, peculiarly within the knowledge of the accused.The presumption that\nthe accused is acting on her own can be rebutted by proof, on a balance of\nprobabilities, pursuant to s.724(3)(d) of the Criminal Code.[29]The\naccused must demonstrate, on a balance of probabilities, that he was a mere\ncourier in this case.I reject that argument.Indeed, the preponderance of\nthe evidence favours the conclusion that the accused was a principal in this\ncase:a.He\ntravelled to Turkey for a number of days prior to bringing the opium back, and\nhad no good explanation for his trip there.He explained that it was to look\nat establishing a business, but could not provide relevant details.As a\nresult, this fact suggests that he was going to Turkey as part of an\nimportation scheme.b.On\nhis own evidence at trial, he had communication with Ms. Poursiamak in the\nairport in Toronto prior to being detained by customs.However, he denied\nknowing Ms. Poursiamak when questioned by customs the night of his arrest.These facts also suggests that he was involved in the importation scheme as a\nprincipal, and that it was a joint venture with Ms. Poursiamak.c.I\nreject the Offender’s evidence that he was paid money to bring this package\ninto Canada, regardless of whether he knew it was opium or currency.The\nOffender’s explanation in this regard is not believable.In particular, I note\nthat the Offender claimed to have been paid $15,000.00 plus expenses to import\nthese packages.This amount is approximately twenty percent of the value of\nthe Opium at the kilogram level.I reject this explanation.Instead, the\nOpium was being imported for his own gain.d.While\nfar from determinative, for many couriers it is readily apparent that they\ncould not be a principal as they have no access to funds as well as obvious\nfinancial need that acts as a motivator.In this case, the opposite is true.\nThe Offender had access to funds, including the funds to purchase a ticket to\nTurkey on short notice, and I heard no evidence of financial need on his part.[30]In\nthe circumstances, therefore, I am of the view that the accused was a principal\nin this importation scheme, and he is not entitled to the mitigation of\nsentence that would be provided to a courier.[31]The\nother aggravating factors in this case are:a)The\namount of opium that was imported, being nearly 4 kilograms.b)The\nfact that the importation was for commercial gain.Purposes\nand Principles of Sentencing[32]The\nstatutory principles and purposes of sentencing are set out in section 718 of\nthe Criminal Code and section 10 of the Controlled Drugs and\nSubstances Act.In light of the fact that the accused was a principal who\nknowingly imported these drugs into the country, the principles of general\ndeterrence and denunciation should be emphasized.[33]There\nare relatively few cases on the sentencing ranges for the importation of opium.\nI was referred to case law by both the Crown and the Defence. The Defence also\nrelied on some of the Crown’s cases in argument.[34]The\nDefence referred me to three British Columbia cases, R v. Aghabeigi\n(2004 BCCA 263 (CanLII)), R v. Pirouz (2009 BCCA 51 (CanLII)) and R. v. Henareh\n(2015 BCSC 2455 (CanLII)).On reviewing these cases, each of them is distinguishable\nfrom the case at bar.[35]Aghabeigi concerned the importation\nof approximately 9.6 kilograms of opium in the lining of two suitcases. Ms.\nAghabeigi was suffering from major depression, fibromyalgia and arrhythmia at\nthe time of the offence. She also developed type 2 diabetes between the time of\nthe offence and the date of sentencing.The Crown sought a sentence of six to\nseven years.Ms. Aghabeigi was given a sentence of three years. The British\nColumbia Court of Appeal found that the sentence in this case was “lenient”. I\nentirely agree with that characterization.Further, the sentence was lenient\nbecause of Ms. Aghabeigi’s personal medical circumstances, which is a factor\nthat does not apply here.[36]Pirouz concerned the importation\nof 3.144 kilograms of opium, as well as the possession of an additional 2.263\nkilograms. Mr. Pirouz was given a conditional sentence of two years less a\nday.In upholding the sentence, the Court of Appeal noted that the\nauthorities, while limited in number, supported a range of sentence of between\nthree and five years. However, the unique personal circumstances of Mr. Pirouz’s\ncase (which included having been imprisoned in Iran, and suffering PTSD as a\nresult), justified a departure from the range.Again, these mitigating factors\nare not present in the Offender’s case.[37]Henareh concerned the importation\nof 14 kilograms of opium.In this case, the Court found that this was a\ncommercial enterprise and that Mr. Henareh’s involvement was more than a\none-time event.While Mr. Henareh was not found to be in partnership with the\nmain importer, it was a business relationship and Mr. Henareh had knowledge of\nthe opium importation scheme.Mr. Henareh was given three years for these\noffences. A number of Ontario cases were distinguished, in part, on “the\ndifferent sentencing regime in Ontario” (see paragraph 93).[38]This\nbrings me to the Ontario cases.I start with R. v. Abolmolouk ((1987)\n23 O.A.C. 144 (C.A.)).In that case, the Court of Appeal considered the range\nof sentence for the importation of 805 grams of opium. This case arose immediately\nafter the Supreme Court’s decision in R. v. Smith (1987) 1987 CanLII 64 (SCC), 75 N.R. 321,\nwhich struck down the mandatory minimum sentence of 7 years under section 5(2)\nof the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.In that case, the Court of\nAppeal found that a sentence of four years for a first time importer was\nappropriate.[39]More\nrecently, in R. v. Rashidi-Alavije (2007 ONCA 712 (CanLII)), the Court of Appeal\naffirmed a sentence of five and a half years for a courier who brought 6\nkilograms of opium into Canada.Mr. Rashidi-Alavije had no criminal record.[40]Then\nthere is the decision in R. v. Bokark (2008 ONCJ 378 (CanLII)).In that case,\nthe accused was a first time Offender who had imported 13 kilograms of opium.The Court found that the accused was involved in both the importation of the\nopium, and in possession for the purposes of trafficking the opium. In those circumstances,\na sentence of nine and a half years was imposed.Bokark clearly\ninvolves a more serious offence than the one in this case.[41]This\nbrings me to the decision in R. v. Rajaei-Mehrabadi (2016 ONSC 3362 (CanLII)). In\nthat case, the Court was dealing with a case where the Offender had imported\n6.45 kilograms of opium, which is more than was imported by the Offender in\nthis case. Taking into account, inter alia, the fact that the accused\nhad anxiety and depression, and that he had been on social assistance, Dawson\nJ. stated (at paragraphs 23 to 25 ):[23]\nBased on my review of the cases, and relying in particular on the factual\ninformation cited at paras. 6 and 7 of Abolmolouk,\nI agree that the range of sentence for the importation of multiple kilograms of\nopium for commercial drug trafficking is three to seven years. I would also\nadopt the British Columbia Court of Appeal’s description of a three year\nsentence for the importation of over nine kilograms in Aghabeigi as lenient.[24]\nIn my view, the quantity involved in the importation and whether the accused is\naddicted or a user, are of critical importance. If the evidence supports a\nfinding of commercial trafficking on a significant scale a midrange\npenitentiary sentence will usually be required in order to deter and denounce\nthe importation of an addictive substance. It is well known that addictions can\nlead to many other social costs and often to the commission of other crimes.\nHowever, the fact that opium is not as addictive as some of the other hard\ndrugs and has a smaller market, are relevant factors affecting the\ndetermination of an appropriate range of sentence.[25]\nI would add that were there any evidence that the opium imported in this case\nwas being used to make morphine or heroin the range of sentence would extend\nconsiderably higher than seven years.[42]In\nthe circumstances, this case is relatively similar to the one that is before\nme.The distinguishing features are the fact that Dawson J. found that the\naccused in his case was a courier, and had a history of anxiety and\ndepression.Dawson J. was also dealing with the importation of 6.45 kilograms\nof opium, which is more than was imported in this case.[43]Dawson\nJ. imposed a sentence of four and a half years.In my view, given the fact\nthat the Offender was a principal, and imported multiple kilograms of opium, I\nam of the view that the sentence should be slightly longer than the sentence in\nRajaei-Mehrabadi.The\nSentence to be Imposed[44]Based\non the foregoing, and based on the Offender’s role in this importation, I find\nthat a fit and proper sentence is five years.[45]There\nwill also be a weapons and firearms prohibition order pursuant to s. 109 of the\nCriminal Code. To the extent such order is discretionary it will be for\nten (10) years.[46]Both\ncounsel agree that the minimum victim surcharge fine of $200.00 should be\nimposed in this case, and I so order.[47]In\naddition, there will be a DNA Order under s.487.051(3)(b) of the Criminal\nCode and a forfeiture Order.___________________________LEMAY JReleased:April 3, 2017CITATION: R v.

Kienapple, 1974 CanLII 14 (SCC), [1975] 1\nS.C.R. 729, counts two to seven in the indictment, being the five counts of\ntheft over and one count of possession of property obtained by crime under\n$5,000, were conditionally stayed.[2]The findings of guilt relate to the theft by Mr.\nSimoes of vehicles from Halton Honda on or about November 28, 2009.The Circumstances of the\nOffender.[3]A pre-sentence report was prepared in\ncontemplation of sentencing which provides some insight and background\nregarding Mr. Simoes’ personal circumstances. However, I note that Mr. Simoes\ndid not provide the author of the report with any collateral sources.[4]Mr. Simoes is 32 years old and was born in\nToronto.He is the youngest of three children.His mother and two brothers\nhave left Canada to reside in Lisbon, Portugal.[5]Mr. Simoes was raised by his parents until they\nseparated when he was ten years old.He recalls a violent home environment and\nstates that he endured physical abuse from both his parents. His father\ncommitted suicide when Mr. Simoes was 15 years of age.[6]Mr.Simoes completed grade eight and obtained\nsome grade nine credits.He has been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder.[7]Mr. Simoes has worked sporadically as a labourer\ndoing construction and landscaping work.[8]Mr. Simoes denies having any alcohol or drug\nissues.However, as noted in the pre-sentence report, the Ministry of\nCommunity, Safety and Correctional Services’ files indicate that he had\nadmitted to excessive drinking on occasion and that excessive alcohol consumption\nhas been a contributing factor in “several incidents”.[9]Mr. Simoes has a history of convictions dating\nback to 1993 in youth court.His first conviction in adult court was on July\n9, 1997, when he was convicted of possession under and sentenced to 45 days incarceration.Since that date he has been convicted on 18 occasions.The adult convictions\ninclude possession of property obtained by crime, theft over, possession of\nbreak-in tools, and dangerous operation of a motor vehicle causing bodily harm.[10]According to the pre-sentence report, the\nMinistry of Community, Safety and Correctional Services’ records do not\nindicate successful completion of community supervision and Mr. Simoes advised\nthe author of the report that he does not wish to have probation imposed as\npart of his sentence.[11]The author of the pre-sentence report reached\nthe following conclusion:CPIC and Ministry records indicate that\nefforts to curb the reoffending that the subject appears to habitually be\ninvolved in, by imposing terms of incarceration appears to have failed. It is\nof a concern to this writer that the subject will return to his serious\noffending behaviour, posing serious danger to the society if he returns to the\ncommunity. It appears that the subject may benefit from a highly structured\nsetting due to his stated request that he not have a community disposition.Position of the Crown[12]Crown counsel submits that a global sentence in\nthe range of 6 to 8 years is appropriate in the circumstances of this case.[13]In support of his position, the Crown submits\nthat Mr. Simoes has embraced a life of crime as evidenced by his record and\nthat periods of probation have not been successful given his previous\nconvictions for breach of probation orders.[14]The Crown submits that the level of moral\nculpability for these offences is high given his related record and the level\nof planning involved in the break and enter.The Crown notes that this was a\ncrime involving high value inventory and that there was no recovery. He\ncategorizes the crime as an “enterprise crime”.[15]Turning to the principles of sentencing, the\nCrown submits that the need for general and specific deterrence is high.Further, he submits that given Mr. Simoes’ past failures with community-based\nsentences and the danger he poses to society, that the need for separation from\nsociety is evident.The Crown submits that Mr. Simoes is not interested in\nrehabilitation or having a positive connection to society or even having any\npro-social relationships, as evidenced by the lack of collateral sources found\nin the pre-sentence report.He notes as well that Mr. Simoes has no ability to\npay restitution and submits that there is a need to promote a sense of\nresponsibility in the circumstances of this case.[16]The Crown concedes that the trial was\nabbreviated because the defence agreed to certain facts and that this is a\nmitigating factor.[17]The Crown submits that Mr. Simoes’ sentence in\nJune of 2005 for driving while disqualified, dangerous operation of a motor\nvehicle, obstruct peace officer, possession of property obtained by crime over\n$5,000 and failure to comply with a probation order was the equivalent of\napproximately 2 years and 3 months.Further, he submits that Mr. Simoes’ sentence\nin April of 2009 for dangerous operation of a motor vehicle causing bodily\nharm, driving while disqualified, possession of property obtained by crime\nunder $5,000 and break enter and commit was the equivalent of approximately 3.9\nyears.The Crown argues that it is clear from the accused’s record that after\nthe April 2009 charges he went out and began accumulating further charges\nrelated to serious crimes.[18]The Crown has advised that on or about June 1,\n2011 Mr. Simoes pleaded guilty in court in Orangeville to charges of break and\nenter and possession of stolen property over, possession of stolen property\nunder and obstruct. He received a global sentence of 315 days pre-trial custody\non a two for one basis, so that sentence shows as 630 days in jail.[19]The Crown calculates that for the purposes of\nthis sentencing Mr. Simoes has pre-trial custody of 419 days, which includes 32\ndays of two-for-one time.With respect to enhanced pre-trial\ncredit, the Crown submits that Mr. Simoes would never have obtained bail given\nhis criminal record and the fact that he has no family available to him to act\nas a surety.He also submitted that there is no evidence that Mr. Simoes would\ntake advantage of programs available to him had he not been in a remand\ncentre.[20]The Crown also submitted that it is appropriate\nto reduce any sentence by the 315 days referred to above on the principle of\ntotality.Thus it is the Crown’s position that the\nglobal sentence be reduced by 734 days.Position of the Defence[21]Defence counsel submits that the appropriate\nsentence is three years of incarceration less a total of 928 days which equates\nto an additional 167 days of custody. The 928 figure includes 380 days\npre-trial custody at the rate 1.5 for 1, 16 days pre-trial custody at a rate of\n2 for 1 rate and the 315 day reduction on the principle\nof totality.[22]In support of her submission for enhanced\npre-trial credit, counsel notes that Mr. Simoes has spent long periods of time\nin pre-trial custody over the last number of years.She relies on the Ontario\nCourt of Appeal decision in R. v. Monje, 2011 ONCA 1 (CanLII), [2011] O.J. No. 1, for the\nproposition that pre-trial custody is the most punitive form of custody.She\nalso relies on R. v. Johnson, 2011 ONCJ 77 (CanLII), [2011] O.J. No. 822 wherein Justice Melvyn\nGreen noted that remand centres do not have the same level of educational\ncounselling, treatment, training and educational programs as prisons.Counsel\nsubmits that Mr. Simoes should be given credit for 1½ days for each day in\npre-trial custody, excluding the 315 days deducted pursuant to the totality\nprinciple.[23]Counsel also points to Mr. Simoes’ background,\nincluding his violent home life as a child and his father’s suicide when he was\n15 years old, as a relevant factor for consideration.She notes that he has no\nfamily support in the country.[24]She submits that Mr. Simoes is in a cycle of\noffences but there has been no increase in terms of the level of violence in\nthe offences.It is her position that when Mr. Simoes’ record is reviewed, it\nis clear that he is being charged with similar offences over and over again and\nthat it is in the public interest to see him rehabilitated.[25]The defence relies on the case of R. v. Alves,\n[2008] O.J. No. 2597 (ON S.C.) wherein Justice Newbould sentenced an offender\nwho had a record of 65 convictions beginning at age 16 to 3½ years less pre-trial\ncustody for a break and enter and theft at a residential property.Counsel\nnotes that courts have traditionally imposed longer sentences in circumstances\nwhere a break and enter has occurred at a residence rather than at a commercial\nestablishment as is the case here.[26]The Ontario Court of Appeal decision in R. v.\nDesjardins, [2007] O.J. No. 1775 (Ont. C.A.) is also relied upon.In that\ncase, the Court reduced a sentence for break and enter from 4 years to 3\nyears.[27]The defence cites the decision of the Alberta\nCourt of Appeal in R. v. Dieter, [2007] ABCA No. 152.In that case, the\nappellant had 22 convictions, 19 which were for property-related offences, and\n7 of those involved break and enters.The sentencing judge imposed a sentence\nof 4 years consecutive.The Court of Appeal found that 4 years was an unfit\nsentence having regard to the nature of the offence, the accused’s early guilty\nplea and the totality principle.They substituted a sentence of 3 years\nconsecutive.[28]Counsel submits that while step-up sentences may\nbe appropriate, the sentence cannot be disproportionate to the seriousness of\nthe offence.Analysis[29]The general principles of sentencing were\nsummarized by Justice Trafford in R. v. Palantzas, [2009] O.J. No. 3682,\nas follows:Under s. 718 of the Code, the fundamental purpose of sentencing\nis to contribute to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful\nand safe society by imposing a just sanction.Any such sanction must, looking\nat the case as a whole, be the result of a fair and balanced consideration of\nthe need to:•denounce the unlawful\nconduct;•deter the offender, and\nothers, from committing such an offence;•separate the offender\nfrom society, where necessary;•assist in the\nrehabilitation of the offender;•provide reparation for\nharm done to \"victims\", or the community;and•provide a sense of\nresponsibility in the offender, while acknowledging the harm done to the\n\"victims\" and the community.Section 718.1 of the Code requires the sentence\nto be proportionate to the offence and the degree of the offender's\nresponsibility.An offender is not to be deprived of his liberty if less\nrestrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances of the case.All\navailable sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the\ncircumstances must be considered for all offenders.It is to be emphasized that these principles of\nsentencing do not include a principle of revenge.Offenders are not\nincarcerated for the purpose of establishing an equivalence between the loss of\nthe victim, or victims, and the sanction imposed by the Court.Rather, the\nCourt is required to recognize the inherent worth and dignity of the offender\nand, having balanced the principles provided by the Code, determine a\nfit sentence in the circumstances of the case.This is the Canadian tradition,\na tradition that enjoys a long and respected history in Canada and other free\nand democratic societies like it throughout the world.[30]I accept that the cooperation by the defence in\nabbreviating the trial is a mitigating factor which I should take into account.[31]Defence counsel provided a case law brief but\nrecognized in her submissions to me that none of the cases submitted was on all\nfours with this case. The Crown did not provide any cases.[32]I believe that defence counsel’s reliance on Desjardin\nis misplaced.In that case, the Court of Appeal noted that the sentencing\njudge indicated that he was prepared to sentence the appellant to “a little\nmore time on top” of pre-trial custody.However, the sentencing judge went on\nto impose a four year sentence on the ground that the appellant had recruited\nhis 14 year old daughter and her boyfriend in the crime.The Court of Appeal\nheld that that factor alone could not properly lead to a three year increase in\nsentence.In the case at bar, there is no single factor which I am relying\nupon in determining the appropriate sentence.[33]In Dieter, one of the grounds relied on\nby the Alberta Court of Appeal was the nature of the crime.In that case, the\nappellant had thrown a rock through a window of a hair salon and stole\napproximately $2,500 in merchandise.In the present case, we are dealing with\na much more sophisticated crime where Mr. Simoes engaged in a very well planned\ntheft of several motor vehicles.Therefore, I find that the facts of the Dieter\ncase are distinguishable from the circumstances of this case.[34]In Alves the sentence for a repeat\noffender charged with break and enter and theft at a residential property was\n3½ years, plus one year each for breach of a probation order and breach of\nrecognizance.The latter two sentences were concurrent with each other but\nconsecutive with the break and enter sentence.Therefore, the total sentence\nwas 4½ years.[35]The Alves case is distinguishable from\nthe present case.In Alves, the offender’s longest previous sentence\nwas 14 months in custody.In the present case, the longest sentence was\neffectively almost 4 years in length and it seemingly had no impact on Mr.\nSimoes’ continuing criminal behaviour.[36]Considering Mr. Simoes’ criminal record, I am\nvery concerned by the fact that even with increasing sentences, he does not\nappear to be able to avoid a life of habitual crime.[37]I am also troubled by the very negative\npre-sentence report which makes clear that Mr. Simoes has no interest in being\nthe subject of community supervision.[38]In the circumstances, I conclude that the most\nappropriate sentence is one which removes Mr. Simoes from society. I believe\nthat a penitentiary sentence is required as a specific deterrent to Mr. Simoes\nto prevent him from committing further offences.[39]Both counsel made reference to the “jump principle”\nwhich was considered by Justice Spies inR v. Smickle [2008] O.J. No.\n2231:[63]I must also consider an\nissue concerning what is referred to as the “jump principle”. That principle\nsuggests that there should not be too great an increase in subsequent sentences\nimposed on an offender over a previous sentence imposed on the same offender.\nIn this case, Mr. Smickle’s last sentence was his longest; an effective\nsentence of ten months after two for one credit for five months time served.[64]Mr. Band argued that\nthe jump principle is particularly applicable in this case given Mr. Smickle’s\nyoung age, the nature of his prior convictions and the type of sentences he has\npreviously received.He argued that Ms. Stanton cannot rely on the 2007\nconviction as an aggravating factor as Mr. Smickle was sentenced while he was\nincarcerated on the convictions before me.In other words, he had no opportunity\nto learn from that sentence.He took the position that I should,\ntherefore, consider his longest sentence to be a sentence of 45 days, which was\nimposed for the 2004 drug convictions, not ten months.[65]Ms. Stanton argued that\nthe jump principle was not applicable because of the severity and nature of the\noffences, the high need for deterrence to be addressed, the fact that\nprotection of the public is paramount, and that the possibility of\nrehabilitation was not present.[66]In J.G., Mr.\nJustice Nordheimer decided that the jump principle did not apply where the\nlongest previous sentence was 22 months, because the convictions before him\nwere more serious than the earlier conduct, there was no likelihood of\nrehabilitation and a sentence of even double the longest previous sentence\nwould fail to achieve the sentencing objectives of deterrence and denunciation[40]I accept the Crown’s position that if Mr. Simoes\nreceived the then standard credit of 2 for 1 for pre-trial custody credit in the\nApril 2009 sentence it was effectively almost 4 years in length.I do not\nbelieve that a substantial penitentiary sentence would violate the “jump\nprinciple”.Even if the April 2009 sentence was less than 4 years, in my view\nthe jump principle is not applicable because of the need for deterrence in this\ncase.[41]The sentence proposed by defence counsel does\nnot adequately reflect the serious nature of the enterprise crime which was\ncommitted and the fact that Mr. Simoes has been seemingly unable to refrain\nfrom engaging in criminal behaviour.[42]Notwithstanding the foregoing, I believe that the\nrange proposed by the Crown of 6 to 8 years is too high. I note that it is\nunsupported by any case law and I decline to accept it as appropriate in the\ncircumstances.[43]Considering all the circumstances of the case, I find that a fit sentence with respect to count 1 – Break\nEnter and Commit – is 5 years incarceration and I sentence Mr. Simoes\naccordingly.[44]I turn now to the submission of the defence that\nMr. Simoes should be granted enhanced credit for pre-trial custody of 1.5 days\nper day served of pre-trial custody.The Truth in\nSentencing Act fundamentally altered the consideration of pre-trial custody\nfor sentencing purposes. It did away with 2 for 1 pre-trial custody credit and\nmade 1 for 1 credit the norm. At the same time, it preserved the right of\nsentencing judges to award enhanced credit of 1.5 for 1 where the circumstances\nwarrant (see R v. Abubeker, 2011 ONCJ 337 at paragraph 14 and R.\nv. Morris, 2011 ONSC 5206 (CanLII) at paragraph 33).[45]In my view, it is not sufficient for the\ndefence, as they have done in this case, to point to the lack of facilities in\nremand centres or to argue that pre-trial custody is effectively “dead time”\nbecause time spent in pre-sentencing custody does not\ncount in calculating eligibility for parole. These were the very\njustifications for the 2 for 1 practice which was eliminated by the Truth in\nSentencing Act. Parliament must be presumed to have been cognizant of these\narguments and issues when it enacted legislation to make 1 for 1 pre-trial\ncustody credit the norm (see Morris at paragraph 33 and R v.\nStephenson, 2011 ONCJ 484 (CanLII) at paragraphs 31 to 32.)[46]In order for a court to find that the\ncircumstances warrant enhanced pre-trial credit there must be something\nspecific to the circumstances of the particular accused which would justify\ndeparting from the ordinary rule. There is nothing in circumstances of this\ncase which leads me to conclude that 1.5 for 1 credit is appropriate. There is\nno evidence before me that Mr. Simoes’ experience in pre-trial custody is any\ndifferent than other person in pre-trial custody.[47]I also agree with the submission of the Crown\nthat there is no suggestion that Mr. Simoes would have been able to obtain bail\nhad he sought to do so, and further that there is no evidence before me that\nMr. Simoes has any interest in taking advantage of any rehabilitation\nopportunities.[48]I decline to order enhanced credit of 1.5 for 1\nand find that the appropriate credit is 1 for 1. Mr.\nSimoes will be given 2 for 1 credit for the 16 days referred to above.[49]I reduce the 5 year sentence of incarceration by\n419 days for pre-trial custody and by 315 days in keeping with the totality principle.The total reduction is\n734 days. The net result is a sentence of 1,091 days of further custody on\ncount 1 in a federal penitentiary.[50]On the remaining counts I find that the\nfollowing are fit sentences and I sentence Mr. Simoes as follows:Count 8 – Obstruct Peace Officer – 18 months incarceration; andCount 9 – Possession of Break-In Instruments – 18 months\nincarceration.[51]The sentences on counts 8 and 9 are concurrent\nwith each other and with the sentence on count 1.[52]The Crown sought a DNA order and that request\nwas not opposed by Mr. Simoes. An order will go\npursuant to section 487.051 of the Criminal Code that Mr. Simoes provide\na DNA sample for the DNA databank.[53]The defence did also not oppose a non\ncommunication order pursuant to section 743.21 of the Criminal Code that\nMr. Simoes not communicate with Andrew Cabral.That order will go.HOURIGAN J.Released: January 25, 2012CITATION: R. v.

H.8 (“H.T.A.”).These seven guilty pleas were entered\non November 23, 2006, in Toronto.One of these offences emanated from the\nNiagara Falls jurisdiction but Kang had that charge transferred to Toronto so\nthat he could resolve all his H.T.A. charges at the same time.Four of\nKang’s seven offences that I convicted him on were for driving a motor vehicle\nwhile his driver’s license had been under suspension contrary to s. 53(1).The\nH.T.A. specifically provides for imprisonment up to a maximum of six\nmonths as a possible sentence for an offender with a second driving while under\nsuspension conviction in a five-year period.The prosecution had informed Kang\non November 23 that it was seeking a custodial term as a sentence.The\nsentencing hearing was then adjourned to January 31, 2007, in order that a\npre-sentence report (“P.S.R.”) for the offender could be prepared.A six-page\nP.S.R. dated January 25, 2007 (Exhibit #3), was prepared by a probation officer\nand provided to both the prosecution and the defendant’s counsel.[2]In the sentencing hearing, the prosecution argued that an\nintermittent custodial sentence of 30 to 45 days, performing community service\nof 200 to 250 hours and a prohibition against driving should be imposed on Kang\nbecause of the nature of the present offences and for Kang’s lengthy record of\ndriving convictions.Kang’s driving record, which he has compiled in a\nrelative short period between January 3, 2003 and July 27, 2004 (Exhibit #1),\nis comprised of 16 convictions under the H.T.A., which include three\nprevious convictions for driving while under suspension. On the other hand,\ncounsel for Kang argued that a custodial sentence should not be imposed on\nKang, since the sentencing objectives of specific and general deterrence and\nrehabilitation could be met with sentencing Kang to a period of probation, to\ncommunity service of 50 to 100 hours, to counseling with his doctor and to a\nprohibition against driving for a specific period and a condition not to attend\nany casinos.Kang’s counsel also submits that the probation officer who\nprepared the P.S.R. recommended these sanctions instead of a custodial sentence\nand that Kang would be a suitable candidate for community supervision.[3]I reserved judgment on sentence at that time and adjourned the\nmatter to March 22, 2007, for my decision.Kang failed to make a personal appearance\non March 22 and on May 7, 2007, for sentencing.His counsel appeared on those\ntwo days on his behalf and requested adjournments, indicating that he was out\nof the country.I then adjourned the matter to August 13, 2007.These,\ntherefore, are my reasons for sentence:2.THE\nOFFENCES[4]The seven guilty pleas made by Kang were for committing the\nfollowing offences:(i)On the 7th day of August 2005, at 2:35 p.m.,\ndid commit the offence of being the driver of vehicle with Ontario\nLicense Plate number ATXE 428 on northtbound Islington Avenue in the City of Toronto of speeding 86 k.p.h. in a 50 k.p.h. zone,\ncontrary to s. 128 of the H.T.A.(ii)On the 7th day of August 2005, at 2:35 p.m.,\ndid commit the offence of being the driver of vehicle with Ontario License\nPlate number ATXE 428 on northtbound IslingtonAvenue in the City of Toronto while\ndriver’s licence was suspended, contrary to s. 53(1) of the H.T.A.(iii)On the 5th day of October 2005, at 9:40 p.m.,\ndid commit the offence of being the driver of vehicle with Ontario\nLicense Plate number ATXE 428 on eastbound Queen Elizabeth Way at RoyalYork Road in the City of Toronto\nof speeding 140 k.p.h. in a 100 k.p.h. zone, contrary to s. 128 of the H.T.A.(iv)On the 5th day of October 2005, at 9:40 p.m.,\ndid commit the offence of being the driver of vehicle with Ontario License\nPlate number ATXE 428 on eastbound QueenElizabeth Way at Royal York Road in the City of Toronto while driver’s licence was suspended, contrary\nto s. 53(1) of the H.T.A.(v)On the 14th day of November 2005, at Highway\n420 and Stanley Avenue in NiagaraFalls did commit the offence of\nbeing the driver of Acura vehicle with Ontario License Plate\nnumber ATXE 428 while driver’s licence was suspended, contrary to s.\n53(1) of the H.T.A.(vi)On the 18th day of December 2005,\nat 11:50 p.m., did commit the offence of being the driver of vehicle with\nOntario License Plate number AXXL 191 of failing to stop for a red light\non Adelaide Street West at Duncan Street in the City of Toronto, contrary to s.\n144(18) of the H.T.A.(vii)On the 18th day of December 2005, at 11:50\np.m., did commit the offence of being the driver of vehicle with Ontario\nLicense Plate number AXXL 191 on AdelaideStreet West at Duncan Street in the City of Toronto while driver’s licence was suspended, contrary\nto s. 53(1) of the H.T.A.3.BACKGROUND\nOF KIHWAN KANG[5]Kihwan Kang was born on April 3, 1982, in Korea.He emigrated toCanada at the age of 13 years with his family.He is a permanent resident of Canada.His father runs a very successful lumber trade business and primarily resides\nin Korea.His mother resides in Canada as a homemaker.However, Kang’s\ncounsel indicated that Kang’s father’s business has burned down and has lost\nthe business since the December immediately preceding the sentencing hearing\nheld on January 31, 2007.However, there is no documentary evidence presented\nto the court that verifies this.Kang also supposedly married a Korean visa student\nnamed Jinok Park on January 6, 2007, in a civil wedding, just weeks before the\nsentencing hearing was held.His new wife is presently in Korea.There is\nalso no documentation presented to the court that verifies that this marriage\nhas occurred.[6]The P.S.R. indicates that Kang is not presently employed but that\nhe had at one time operated his own computer and technology company.His\ncounsel submits that Kang is still trying to start another business that sets\nup websites.Again, there is no documentation that supports his present\nefforts to start another business, although counsel indicated she would provide\nsuch documentation, if available, to the court before March 22, 2007.For the\nP.S.R., the probation officer interviewed Kang’s uncle, who lives in Canada,\nand summarized what Kang’s uncle said about Kang in the P.S.R.Kang’s uncle\ndid not describe Kang in a very flattering light.Kang is portrayed by his\nuncle as someone who is not a very industrious or dependable, nor is he very\nmature or responsible in his actions.Furthermore, the probation officer\nindicated that Kang’s uncle had described Kang as living a privileged life\nwhere he drives fast cars and spends all his time gambling at casinos.This\nlifestyle, as suggested by Kang’s uncle, is made possible by his parents in Korea\nwho send money to him to support him.The uncle also paints Kang as a playboy\nliving on the money his parents send him.[7]The probation officer also writes in the P.S.R. that:Mr.\nChong described the subject’s parents as law-abiding, peaceful and loving\nhowever he was of the opinion that they “spoiled” the subject with endless\namounts of spending money and material goods (for example buying him expensive\nluxury cars).He is of the opinion that the subject now lacks the appropriate\nmotivation to pursue education /employment as he is aware that his parents are\nvery wealthy and will continue to provide for him.[8]The P.S.R. also indicates that Kang had also been enrolled in a\nprestigious private school in Canada, but was expelled from that school.His\nuncle also indicated that he believed that Kang was irresponsible in marrying\nsomeone without first introducing the woman to his family.[9]In addition, Kang has a criminal record\nrelated to domestic assault on a girlfriend.He was convicted of assaulting a\ngirlfriend on February 10, 2003.He received a suspended sentence (with 12\ndays pre-sentence custody) and 6 months probation with a condition to attend\nthe PARS (Partner Assault Response) program.In addition, the P.S.R. indicates\nthat Kang had only attended a few classes of the program and was discharged\nfrom the program because of the issue with his attendance.However,\npsychiatric counseling was later substituted as an alternative to the PARS\nprogram.The P.S.R. also indicates that Kang had been attending this\ncounselling since March 9, 2006, every two to three weeks, but had missed\nseveral appointments with his doctor in the fall of 2006.4.KIHWAN\nKANG’S DRIVING RECORD[10]Since September 2002, up to the date of his driving record of\nOctober 18, 2005 (Exhibit #1), Kang has compiled the following driving record\nof convictions and suspensions related to driving or operating a motor vehicle\nin

FOR REGULATORY OFFENCES IN ONTARIO[11]Penalties that are imposed for committing provincial or\nregulatory offences in Ontario are primarily in the form of fines.Custodial\nsentences are rare, but nevertheless are available as a penal sanction.The Provincial\nOffences Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.33 (“P.O.A.”), which governs\nregulatory, provincial offences or public welfare offences in Ontario provides\nfor a general penalty regime according to the type of the proceeding, where the charging statute does not contain a\npenalty section.Thus, offences are divided into two regimes under the P.O.A.\nwith corresponding penalty provisions: Part 1 offences and Part III offences\n(Part II offences refer specifically to parking infractions).A provincial statute in Ontario that contains its\nown penalty section is not limited by the penalties provided for in the P.O.A.,\nunless the charge is commenced under Part I of the P.O.A., then it is\nlimited to the imposition of a fine only that does not exceed $500.[12]In addition, the P.O.A. provides for other rules for\nsentencing offenders convicted of regulatory offences in Ontario.Hence, for\nan offender sentenced at the same time to multiple terms of imprisonment for\ndifferent offences, the rule under s. 64 of the P.O.A. requires that the\noffender serve those custodial sentences consecutively unless the court orders\nthose sentences to be served concurrently:64.Where a person is subject to\nmore than one term of imprisonment at the same time, the terms shall be served\nconsecutively except in so far as the court has ordered a term to be served\nconcurrently with any other term of imprisonment.(a)Penalty under the POA for Part I offences[13]Part I offences are for relatively minor regulatory offences and\nare commenced by a certificate of offence being issued by an enforcement\nofficer, where the only penalty that can be imposed by a court is in the form\nof a fine up to a maximum of $500 or the maximum fine provided for in the\ncharging statute, whichever is the lesser.Imprisonment or probation is not\navailable as a sanction for a Part I offence.The fines provided for Part I\noffences are also part of the “set fine” regime that comprises of specific\nfines that are considered to be out-of-court settlements, in which a defendant\ncan avoid a trial by paying the set fine on the certificate of offence.The\npenalty regime for Part I offences is set out in s. 12(1) of the P.O.A.:12(1)Where the penalty prescribed for an offence includes a fine of more\nthan $500 or imprisonment and a proceeding is commenced under this Part, the\nprovision for fine or imprisonment does not apply and in lieu thereof the\noffence is punishable by a fine of not more than the maximum fine prescribed\nfor the offence or $500, whichever is the lesser.(b)Penalty under the\nPOA for Part III offences[14]On the other hand, Part III offences are considered to be more\nserious regulatory offences that are commenced by an information sworn out by\nan enforcement officer and have a penalty regime that include higher fines,\nprobation and imprisonment.Imprisonment however can only be imposed if the\nspecific charging statute provides for it as a sanction or penalty upon\nconviction, since the general penalty section for Part III offences under s. 61\nof the P.O.A. does not provide for imprisonment, but only provides for\nfines up to a maximum of $5,000.However, if the charging statute has its own\npenalty section then the general penalty section under s. 61 of the P.O.A. does\nnot apply:General penalty61.Except where otherwise\nexpressly provided by law, every person who is convicted of an offence is\nliable to a fine of not more than $5,000.(c)Other sanctions\navailable under the POA for Part III offences[15]The P.O.A. also provides for probation as a sanction under\ns. 72 and s. 73 for a term that does not exceed two years, but only for Part\nIII offences:Probation order72(1)Where a\ndefendant is convicted of an offence in a proceeding commenced by information,\nthe court may, having regard to the age, character and background of the\ndefendant, the nature of the offence and the circumstances surrounding its\ncommission,(a)suspend\nthe passing of sentence and direct that the defendant comply with the\nconditions prescribed in a probation order;(b)in\naddition to fining the defendant or sentencing the defendant to imprisonment,\nwhether in default of payment of a fine or otherwise, direct that the defendant\ncomply with the conditions prescribed in a probation order; or(c)where\nit imposes a sentence of imprisonment on the defendant, whether in default of\npayment of a fine or otherwise, that does not exceed ninety days, order that\nthe sentence be served intermittently at such times as are specified in the\norder and direct that the defendant, at all times when he or she is not in\nconfinement pursuant to such order, comply with the conditions prescribed in a\nprobation order.Statutory conditions of order72(2)A probation\norder shall be deemed to contain the conditions that,(a)the\ndefendant not commit the same or any related or similar offence, or any offence\nunder a statute of Canada or Ontario or any other province of Canada that is\npunishable by imprisonment;(b)the\ndefendant appear before the court as and when required; and(c)the\ndefendant notify the court of any change in the defendant’s address.Conditions imposed by court72(3)In addition to\nthe conditions set out in subsection (2), the court may prescribe as a\ncondition in a probation order,(a)that\nthe defendant satisfy any compensation or restitution that is required\nor authorized by an Act;(b)with\nthe consent of the defendant and where the conviction is of an offence that is\npunishable by imprisonment, that the defendant perform a community service as\nset out in the order;(c)where\nthe conviction is of an offence punishable by imprisonment, such other\nconditions relating to the circumstances of the offence and of the defendant\nthat contributed to the commission of the offence as the court considers\nappropriate to prevent similar unlawful conduct or to contribute to the\nrehabilitation of the defendant; or(d)where\nconsidered necessary for the purpose of implementing the conditions of the\nprobation order, that the defendant report to a responsible person designated\nby the court and, in addition, where the circumstances warrant it, that the\ndefendant be under the supervision of the person to whom he or she is required\nto report.Form of order72(4)A\nprobation order shall be in the prescribed form and the court shall specify\ntherein the period for which it is to remain in force, which shall not be for\nmore than two years from the date when the order takes effect.…Regulations for community service orders72(6) The\nLieutenant Governor in Council may make regulations governing restitution,\ncompensation and community service orders, including their terms and\nconditions.…When order comes into force73(1)A\nprobation order comes into force,(a)on\nthe date on which the order is made; or(b)where\nthe defendant is sentenced to imprisonment other than a sentence to be served\nintermittently, upon the expiration of that sentence.Continuation in force73(2)Subject to\nsection 75, where a defendant who is bound by a probation order is convicted of\nan offence or is imprisoned in default of payment of a fine, the order\ncontinues in force except in so far as the sentence or imprisonment renders it\nimpossible for the defendant to comply for the time being with the order.[16]The P.O.A. also provides for performing community service\nas part of a probation order under s. 72(3)(b), if the defendant consents to\nsuch a sanction and the offence is punishable by imprisonment:72(3)In addition to\nthe conditions set out in subsection (2), the court may prescribe as a\ncondition in a probation order,…(b)with\nthe consent of the defendant and where the conviction is of an offence that is\npunishable by imprisonment, that the defendant perform a community service as\nset out in the order; …(d)Penalties\nUnder The Highway Traffic Act[17]However, where the charging statute contains its own penalty\nsection, such as the H.T.A., I will not need to rely on the penalty\nsections of the P.O.A.However, because Kang has been convicted of Part\nIII offences I may imposea period of probation, if appropriate, on Kang and\nwill need, therefore, to rely on the probation provisions contained in ss. 72\nand 73 of the P.O.A.[18]Penalties available under the H.T.A. are generally in the\ncategory of fines, but imprisonment is nevertheless available to a sentencing\ncourt for special offences.The H.T.A. has a general penalty regime set\nout in s. 214(1) that is restricted to a range of fines of not less than $60\nbut not more than $500:General penalty214(1)Every person who\ncontravenes this Act or any regulation is guilty of an offence and on\nconviction, where a penalty for the contravention is not otherwise provided for\nherein, is liable to a fine of not less than $60 and not more than $500.(i)Special Penalty Section in\nH.T.A. For The Office Of Driving While Under Suspension[19]A conviction for a driving while under suspension\noffence under s. 53(1) of the H.T.A. is one of those special offences\nthat is not governed by the general penalty section set out in s. 214(1) of the\nH.T.A..Section 53(1)(b) provides for a term of imprisonment not\nexceeding six months, in addition to a minimum fine of $2,000 to a maximum fine\nof $5000 for a second conviction of driving while under suspension.Therefore,\nKang is subject to being sentenced to a period of incarceration, because his\npresent four convictions for driving while under suspension would be his second\nconviction within five years and would fall within the sanction contained in s.\n53(1)(b).According to Kang’s driving record, his last conviction of his three\nprevious convictions for driving while under suspension occurred on July 16,\n2004, which is within the five-year period of the present four convictions of\ndriving while under suspension as prescribed under s. 53(2):Driving while driver’s licence suspended53(1)Every person who\ndrives a motor vehicle or street car on a highway while his\nor her driver’s licence is suspended under an Act of the Legislature or a\nregulation made thereunder is guilty of an offence and on conviction is liable,(a)for a first\noffence, to a fine of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000; and(b)for each\nsubsequent offence, to a fine of not less than $2,000 and not more than $5,000,\nor to imprisonment for a term of not more than six months, or to both.…Subsequent offence53(2)Where a person who has previously been convicted of an offence\nunder subsection (1) is convicted of the same offence within five years\nafter the date of the previous conviction, the offence for which he or she is\nlast convicted shall be deemed to be a subsequent offence for the purpose\nof clause (1)(b).[20]Section 53(1)(b) demonstrates this offence’s gravity and the\nprovincial legislators’ concern with individuals repeatedly driving motor\nvehicles while their licences are under suspension by specifically providing\nfor imprisonment as a penal sanction, in contrast to the imposition of fines as\nthe general sanction for traffic offences, and is also an indication that\nimprisonment would be a suitable penalty for committing the same offence more\nthan once in the last five years.In addition, by specifically providing for a\nsanction of imprisonment, especially when general penalties under the P.O.A.\nand the H.T.A. only provide for the imposition of fines, is also\nindicative that imprisoning an offender on being convicted of driving while\nunder suspension for the second time within a five-year period would not be\nunusual or inappropriate.(ii)Automatic License\nSuspension[21]Section 53(3) of the H.T.A. also provides for the\noffender’s driver license to be automatically suspended for a period of six\nmonths upon conviction and that suspension commences to run only after any\nother suspension already in place is completed:Licence suspended53(3)The driver’s licence of a person who is\nconvicted of an offence under subsection (1) or (1.1) is thereupon suspended\nfor a period of six months in addition to any other period for which the\nlicence is suspended, and consecutively thereto.[22]In Kang’s case, he would therefore\nautomatically receive four six-month licence suspensions to run consecutively\nfor the four drive while under suspension convictions, which means this period\nof suspension would ultimately last for a period of two years during which he would\nnot be eligible to drive a motor vehicle in Ontario.6.USE\nOF PRE-SENTENCE REPORT IN THE SENTENCING OF REGULATORY OFFENDERS[23]The use of a pre-sentence report (P.S.R.) is provided for under\ns. 56(1) of the P.O.A.:Pre-sentence report56(1)Where a defendant is convicted of\nan offence in a proceeding commenced by information, the court may direct a\nprobation officer to prepare and file with the court a report in writing\nrelating to the defendant for the purpose of assisting the court in imposing sentence.[24]Kang’s counsel did not object to the contents of the P.S.R. that\nportrayed Kang negatively.Thus, if there is no objection to the negative\ninformation within the P.S.R. then a sentencing court may properly take into\naccount negative information about the offender to which no objection was\ntaken, including his drug use, gambling, and lack of remorse, so as to relate\nthe offences to the individual: R. v. Riley, (1996) 1996 CanLII 5615 (NS CA), 107 C.C.C. (3d) 278, 150 N.S.R. (2d) 390, [1996]\nN.S.J. No. 183 (QL) (N.S.C.A.).[25]The purpose of a pre-sentence report is to supply to the court a\npicture of the offender as a person in society.A probation officer’s\nrecommendation for community supervision only means that he is not unsuitable\nfor community supervision.The probation officer in developing their\nrecommendation does not take into account deterrence and other sentencing\nobjectives that a sentencing court has to consider in finding a fit and\nsuitable sentence for the offender.The probation officer does not determine\nthe appropriate sentence, but prepares a report to assist the sentencing court\nassess the offender’s background, maturity, bahaviour, attitude and willingness\nto make amends and to better able the court to view the offender as a person\nwith individual characteristics.[26]Although Kang’s counsel submits that the probation officer\nrecommended community supervision, counseling and a prohibition against driving\nas a sanction, I would not interpret the probation officer’s assessment in\nthose terms.Instead, I would take it that the probation officer only\nconcluded that sentencing Kang to community supervision would not be\ninappropriate, in light of his background and personal circumstances.In\naddition, a probation officer does not have the mandate to consider factors,\nwhich a sentencing court would consider at arriving at a fit sentence, such as\ngeneral and specific deterrence and denunciation for the offence committed.[27]The function of a P.S.R. is explained in R. v. Bartkow\n(1978), 24 N.S.R. (2d) 518, at para. 10, where the Nova Scotia Supreme Court\nconcluded that a P.S.R. should be confined to portraying the background,\nfamily, education, employment record, physical and mental health, associates,\nsocial activities, potential and motivation of the person and that its function\nis not to tell the court what sentence should be imposed [emphasis is mine\nbelow].I\nwish those who prepare such reports would realize that it is no part of their\njob to give any information, whether inculpatory or exculpatory, respecting\noffences which the accused committed, especially ones for which he has not been\nconvicted. Their function is to supply a picture of the accused as a person in\nsociety - his background, family, education, employment record, his physical\nand mental health, his associates and social activities, and his potentialities\nand motivations. Their function is not to supply evidence of criminal\noffences or details of a criminal record or to tell the court what sentence\nshould be imposed.7.IMPRISONMENT\nAS A SANCTION FOR REGULATORY OFFENCES[28]Imprisonment is regarded as the sanction of last resort, but it\nis still available for use in deterring others from committing similar\noffences.This sentencing principle of imprisonment as a last resort\nhas been recently codified in the Criminal Code under s. 718.2(d).In\naddition, Clayton Ruby in his tome entitled, \"Sentencing (2ed)\", at\npage 284-285 succinctly summarized the function of custodial sentences, which I\nfind is very applicable to the present case [emphasis is mine below]:Nevertheless there are offences and offenders for\nwhom there is no other alternative consistent with the judicial responsibility\nto protect the public.Thus, when one examines the factors\ndetermining the imposition of imprisonment, one should bear in mind that\nimprisonment acts almost entirely as punishment and contains little if any\nreformative aspect.There is a general conviction, perceivable over the\nyears and increasing in strength, that custodial sentences ought to be\nimposed only as a last resort and where all other measures either have failed\nor cannot reasonably be expected to succeed.In addition, custodial\nsentences are necessary where the offences itself is so serious that no other\nmeasure will adequately express the condemnation which society directs at the\ncrime, or where the element of deterrence to others demands a sentence of\nimprisonment.[29]In R. v. Wholesale Travel Group Inc. (1991), 1991 CanLII 39 (SCC), 67 C.C.C.\n(3d) 193 (S.C.C.) at para. 218-220, the Supreme Court of Canada considered the\nrationale for the use of imprisonment as a sanction for regulatory offences and\nconcluded that imprisonment must be available for regulatory schemes to\nencourage compliance and effective enforcement of regulatory measures [emphasis\nis mine below]:The ultimate question is whether the imposition of\nimprisonment on the basis of strict liability comports with the principles of\nfundamental justice.For the reasons set out earlier concerning the\nunderlying rationale of regulatory offences, I am of the opinion that it does.Regulatory schemes can only be effective if they\nprovide for significant penalties in the event of their breach.Indeed,\nalthough it may be rare that imprisonment is sought, it must be available as a\nsanction if there is to be effective enforcement of the regulatory measure.Nor\nis the imposition of imprisonment unreasonable in light of the danger that can\naccrue to the public from breaches of regulatory statutes.The\nspectre of tragedy evoked by such names as Thalidomide, Bhopal, Chernobyl and\nthe Exxon Valdez can leave no doubt as to the potential human and environmental\ndevastation which can result from the violation of regulatory\nmeasures.Strong sanctions including imprisonment are vital to the\nprevention of similar catastrophes.The potential for serious harm\nflowing from the breach of regulatory measures is too great for it to be said\nthat imprisonment can never be imposed as a sanction.I would only add that, in those circumstances where\nthe imposition of imprisonment would be grossly disproportionate to the offence\ncommitted, the accused person would have a compelling claim under s. 12 of the\nCharter. However, the fact that it is possible to imagine instances where the\nuse of imprisonment would be inappropriate should not be used to justify the\nconclusion that imprisonment can never be imposed in respect of strict\nliability offences. Imprisonment must be available to governments as a\nsanction if the power to regulate is to be effective.[30]Accordingly, a sentence of imprisonment for an offender\ncontravening a regulatory offence is an appropriate sanction for achieving\ncertain sentencing objectives, especially when there is potential for that\noffender, based on their history of unlawful conduct, to cause substantial harm\nto the public.8.LICENSING AND PRIVILEGE TO DRIVE[31]Driving is a privilege; it is not a God-given nor a\nconstitutional right.This principle has been confirmed by the Supreme Court of\nCanada in Galaske v. O'Donnell, 1994 CanLII 128 (SCC), [1994]\n1 S.C.R. 670, [1994] S.C.J. No. 28 (QL) (S.C.C.) at para. 26:The\ndriving of a motor vehicle is neither a God-given nor a constitutional\nright.It is a licensed activity that is subject to a number of\nconditions, including the demonstration of a minimum standard of skill and\nknowledge pertaining to driving.Obligations and responsibilities\nflow from the right to drive.[32]Section 31 of the H.T.A. also reaffirms the principle that\ndriving is a privilege:31.The purpose of this Part is to protect the public by ensuring that,(a)the privilege of driving on a highway is granted to, and retained\nby, only those persons who demonstrate that they are likely to drive safely;\nand(b)full driving privileges are granted to novice and probationary\ndrivers only after they acquire experience and develop or improve safe driving\nskills in controlled conditions.[33]I also find that Kang’s behaviour and repeated actions of\ncontinuing to drive a motor vehicle, when he was aware that his driver’s\nlicence had been suspended, is nothing less than absolute disregard for the\nlaw.It is also an indication that he treats driving as a right and not as a\nprivilege.Therefore, in Kang’s case, the sentencing objectives of specific\ndeterrence and denunciation are foremost considerations in determining a fit\nsentence.9.POTENTIAL\nHARM THAT UNLICENSED DRIVERS POSE TO THE SAFETY OF THE PUBLIC[34]In R. v. Ladouceur, 1990 CanLII 108 (SCC), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1257, [1990] S.C.J. No. 53 (QL) (S.C.C.) at\nparas. 43, 46 and 47, the Supreme Court of Canada concluded that proper laws\nand regulations are necessary to regulate the privilege of driving a motor\nvehicle on public roads and to prevent or lessen the carnage on highways and\nthat unlicensed and uninsured drivers have a marked propensity for being\ninvolved in serious motor vehicle accidents:It shows that between 1980 and 1984, the\nnumber of accidents reported in Ontario came within the range of 182,000 to\nalmost 200,000.These accidents resulted in the death of well over\n1000 persons, as well as injuries to more than 90,000 others, in each of these\nyears.In 1984 alone, the amount of estimated property damage\nreached close to $500 million (Ontario Motor Vehicle Accident\nFacts:1980, 1981, 1982, 1983 [page1280] and 1984).These\nexcerpts highlight the potential for killing, for injury and for material\ndestruction which is associated with the operation of automobiles.It\nis fitting that governmental action be taken to prevent or at least to lessen\nthis carnage on our highways.Proper laws and regulations are\nnecessary to regulate the privilege of driving a motor vehicle on public\nthoroughfares.…In addition, significant weight must\nbe given to the statistical evidence that demonstrates a positive correlation\nbetween unlicensed driving and an increased risk of serious highway accidents.In\n1984, for example, there were 330,000 reported automobile accidents in Ontario,\n1500 of which resulted in fatalities.Of the total of 330,000, over\n6,000 (roughly 2 percent) involved unlicensed drivers.However,\nin what I consider a truly astounding figure, of the 1,500 fatal accidents,\nover 100 (or roughly 7 percent) involved unlicensed drivers.In\nother words, in accidents involving licensed drivers, the probability of\nfatalities was 214 to 1, while for unlicensed drivers the same probability was\n59 to 1.The same type of comparison for insured and uninsured\nvehicles involved in fatal accidents yielded results which were almost as\nmarked.To drive without proper insurance increases the chances of\ninvolvement in fatal accidents from 212 to 1 to 83 to 1 (Ontario Motor Vehicle\nAccident Facts:1984).The statistics for 1982 and 1983\nreveal a comparable pattern.The only method of ensuring that the\nbrakes and seat belts are operational is by stopping and checking\nvehicles.Of even greater importance is to determine if a driver\nis licensed and insured.Once again this can only be done by\nstopping vehicles.The unlicensed driver is a statistically\nproven menace on the highways.Moreover, such a driver has\ndemonstrated a contempt for the law and an irresponsible attitude as well as a\nmarked propensity to being involved in serious accidents.All users\nof the highways have an interest in seeing that unlicensed drivers are\napprehended and removed from the highway.As well, society as a\nwhole has an interest in reducing the cost of medical, hospital and\nrehabilitation services which must be provided to accident victims and in\nminimizing the emotional damage suffered by the victims'\nfamilies.Surely the preventive medication of requiring drivers to\nstop provided by s. 189a(1) is preferable to the incurable terminal tragedy\nrepresented by the fatal accident victim and the permanently disabled\nvictim.Surely it must be better to permit the random stop and\nprevent the accident [page1282] than to deny the right to stop and repeatedly\nconfirm the sad statistics at the morgue and hospital.The majority\nreasons of United States Supreme Court in Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U.S. 648\n(1979), finding random stops unconstitutional, were specifically rejected in\nHufsky. However, the position on this issue was well put by Rehnquist J. (as he\nthen was) in his dissenting reasons, at p. 666:The State's primary interest ... is\nin traffic safety, not in apprehending unlicensed motorists for the sake of\napprehending unlicensed motorists.The whole point of enforcing\nmotor vehicle safety regulations is to remove from the road the unlicensed\ndriver before he demonstrates why he is unlicensed.The\n[majority of the United States Supreme] Court would apparently prefer that the\nState check licenses and vehicle registrations as the wreckage is being towed\naway.10.APPLYING\nSENTENCING OBJECTIVES AND PRINCIPLES TO THE OFFENDER AND HIS CIRCUMSTANCES[35]To arrive at an appropriate sentence for Kang, I must adhere to\nLamer C.J.C.’s guidance in R. v. M.(C.A.) (1996), 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), 105 C.C.C. (3d) 327\n(S.C.C.) at p. 370, where he wrote that the principal duty of a sentencing\njudge is to apply the established principles of sentencing in determining a\njust and appropriate sentence which reflects the gravity of the offence\ncommitted and the moral blameworthiness of the offender:the\noverarching duty of a sentencing judge is to draw upon all the legitimate\nprinciples of sentencing to determine a ``just and appropriate'' sentence which\nreflects the gravity of the offence committed and the moral blameworthiness of\nthe offender.[36]In addition, the Court of Appeal for Ontario in R. v. Cotton\nFelts Ltd. (1982), 2 C.C.C. (3d) 287, at p. 295, established deterrence as\nthe paramount consideration for deciding a fit sentence for a public welfare or\nregulatory offence.Hence, as a sentencing objective, deterrence furthers the\naim of public welfare legislation to protect the physical, economic and social\nwelfare of the public, which is essential for the proper functioning of society\n[emphasis is mine below]:deterrence is not to be taken only\nin its usual negative connotation of achieving compliance by threat of\npunishment. Recently my brother Zuber in R. v. Ramdass, a judgment pronounced\non November 17, 1982 [since reported 2 C.C.C. (3d) 247], referred to deterrence in a more positive aspect. There\nhe was dealing with a driving offence and he quoted an earlier unreported\ndecision of this court in R. v. Roussy, unreported, released December 15, 1977\n[summarized 2 W.C.B. 72], where the court stated:But\nin a crime of this type the deterrent quality of the sentence must be given\nparamount consideration, and here I am using the term deterrent in its\nwidest sense. A sentence by emphasizing community disapproval of an act, and\nbranding it as reprehensible has a moral or educative effect, and thereby\naffects the attitude of the public. One then hopes that a person with an\nattitude thus conditioned to regard conduct as reprehensible will not likely\ncommit such an act.This aspect of deterrence is\nparticularly applicable to public welfare offences where it is essential for\nthe proper functioning of our society for citizens at large to expect that\nbasic rules are established and enforced to protect the physical, economic and\nsocial welfare of the public.[37]Furthermore, not only must the sanction used to achieve\nparticular goals of sentencing be just, the sentencing process itself must also\nenjoy the acceptance and respect of the community at large: R. v. Sweeney\n(1992), 1992 CanLII 4030 (BC CA), 71 C.C.C. (3d) 82, 11 C.R. (4th) 1 (B.C.C.A.), at p. 96 of 71 C.C.C.\n(3d) 82:That\npurpose is achieved if the imposition of legal sanctions discourages both\nconvicted offenders from re-offending and those who have yet to offend from\ndoing so at all. Overlying and influencing the ability of the legal sanction or\nsentencing process to achieve this purpose, however, is the extent to which\nthat process enjoys the acceptance and respect of the community at large.[38]I must also adhere to the principle of parity, which requires a\nsentencing court to impose a sentence that is similar to sentences imposed on\nsimilar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.This traditional principle of sentencing has been codified in s. 718.2(b) of\nthe Criminal Code and adopted for regulatory offences in R. v. Kirk\n(No. 1), [2005] O.J. No. 3316 (QL), 2005 ONCJ 352 (O.C.J.) (CanLII), at\npara. 16.[39]Therefore, a fit sentence should be proportional to the gravity\nof the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender: R. v.\nM(C.A.) (1996), 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), 105 C.C.C. (3d) 327 (S.C.C.).(a) Submissions for Kang\non penalty[40]Kang’s counsel submits that the P.S.R.\nis more meaningful for its conclusion and the recommendation by the probation\nofficer that Kang is suitable for community supervision.His counsel also\nargues that Kang has recognized that his behaviour was inappropriate by\npleading guilty.As to his gambling problem, Kang’s counsel submits that Kang\nneeds counseling to address the problem.It is also submitted by Kang’s\ncounsel that a significant amount of community service would assist in his\nrehabilitation.[41]Kang’s counsel also submits that Kang’s\nmother has indicated that she will no longer support Kang financially and that\nKang’s father had business burned down since December and has also lost the\nbusiness.[42]Kang’s counsel also argues that Kang getting married is not a\nfactor in his past behaviour.It was also suggested that Kang needs more\ncounselling to address his immaturity and behaviour.[43]Counsel also submits that Kang was not driving his own car, but\nused his mother’s car when apprehended by the police and charged for the last\noffence.In addition, Kang’s counsel submits that Kang has lost all his money\nthat he derived from his own business and now has no money and no car.However, Kang does reside by himself in his own apartment, even though not\ngainfully employed.(b)Submissions by\nprosecution on penalty[44]On the principle of parity, the prosecution argues that it would\nnot be unusual for someone with seven convictions for driving while under\nsuspension to receive a sentence of imprisonment of four to five months.(c)Deterrence, renunciation, rehabilitation[45]Kang’s guilty plea to all his outstanding charges under the H.T.A.\nis virtually the only mitigating factor that I could consider in determining a\nfit sentence.I will treat his admission to the wrongful conduct as a sign of\nremorse.Ergo, except for his guilty plea to all the charges, Kang’s lengthy\ndriving record over a relative short period and three previous convictions for\ndriving while under suspension would have subjected him to a higher range of\npenalties, unless he would have been able to otherwise demonstrate that there\nis the existence of special circumstances or other mitigating factors.[46]As for his personal circumstances, Kang is not gainfully employed\nnor is there an indication of a legitimate business being operated by Kang that\ncould be harmed by imposing a custodial sentence.His counsel’s submissions\nindicated that he was trying to set up another website business similar to one\nthat he use to own and operate, but I have no evidence that it is off and\nrunning.It is also submitted that he is recently married but that his new wife\nis still in Korea.Hopefully, this rite of passage and new stage in his life\nwill make Kang more mature and responsible.On the negative side, his\nbackground indicates that he is someone who had or is still living a life of\nprivilege and a jet-set lifestyle where his parents who own a factory in Korea\nsupport him and paid for his lifestyle.However, his counsel now submits that\nKang has lost all his money and that his mother will no longer pay for his\nlifestyle.[47]Regardless of his father’s apparent misfortune, I agree with the\nprosecution that for the particular circumstances surrounding the offences that\nwere committed and his driving record and his background, a custodial sentence\nwould not be inappropriate, despite his new outlook on life.[48]The fact that Kang’s lengthy driving record has been compiled\nover a relatively short period, coupled with his inability to comply with the\nrules of the road and his flagrant disregard for the law by repeatedly\ncommitting the offence of driving while under suspension on four occasions\nwithin a five-month period in 2005, makes him fall within that category\nreserved for the worst offender, where the highest sanctions that could be\nimposed would not be an unreasonable sentence.His four apprehensions by the\npolice for driving while under suspension were relatively close to each other\nand showed deliberate and intentional transgressions of Ontario’s traffic\nlaws.He has certainly and repeatedly abused his driving privilege in Ontario.His driving behaviour and unlawful conduct have also put him into that category\ndescribed by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Ladouceur, 1990 CanLII 108 (SCC), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1257, [1990] S.C.J. No. 53 (QL), of\nunlicensed and uninsured drivers, who have a propensity for being involved in\nvery serious motor vehicle accidents.His previous driving record of 16\nconvictions in less than two years plus the seven convictions in the present\ncase show that he is a serious risk to other drivers using Ontario highways.Therefore, the correct approach to protect the public from drivers such as Kang\nis to impose strong sanctions that address general and specific deterrence and\ndenunciation.Accordingly, in Kang’s case a period of incarceration would be\nan appropriate sentence.[49]In light of the objectives of sentencing, a period of\nincarceration would be the least restrictive sanction that I could impose,\nconsidering Kang’s age, character and background that would achieve the\nrelevant sentencing goals of rehabilitation, general and specific deterrence, separation\nof offenders, denunciation, making reparations and promoting a sense of\nresponsibility in the offender.[50]In addition, a period of probation is also a sanction that can be\nused to achieve certain sentencing objectives that is specific to Kang and the\ncircumstances surrounding the offences committed.A term of probation would be\nappropriate to address Kang’s need for rehabilitation and specific deterrence.[51]Therefore, in considering these factors and the need for\ndeterrence, rehabilitation, promoting responsibility in the offender and for\ndenunciation, this case requires a sanction that is more than just probation\nwith conditions of community service, counselling and a prohibition against\ndriving or attending casinos.Imposing a custodial sentence, significant fines\nand a period of probation would meet the sentencing objectives for this\nparticular offender and the circumstances surrounding the offences committed.[52]In considering the principle of totality and the appropriate\nlength of imprisonment, I have weighed his guilty pleas, the circumstances\nsurrounding the offences and the background of the offender with the relevant\nsentencing objectives.Therefore, the appropriate sentence for three of the\nfour driving while under suspension convictions will be a custodial sentence.For the driving while under suspension conviction for August 7, 2005, I will\nnot impose a custodial sentence but will instead impose a fine of $2000 with no\nperiod of probation.However, for the driving while under suspension conviction\nfor October 5, 2005, I have determined that the appropriate sanction is a\ncustodial sentence of 10 days of imprisonment with a fine of $2500 and with no\nperiod of probation.For the driving while under suspension conviction of\nNovember 14, 2005, I have also determined that the appropriate sanction is a\ncustodial sentence of 15 days of imprisonment with no fine and with no period\nof probation.For the driving while under suspension conviction of December\n18, 2005, I have also determined that the appropriate sanction is a custodial\nsentence of 20 days of imprisonment with no fine, but with a period of\nprobation of two years.[53]In considering the principle of totality and whether these three\ncustodial sentences should be served concurrently, I have decided that the\ncircumstances of this particular defendant warrant that these three custodial\nsentences be served consecutively as required under s. 64 of the P.O.A.In addition, I find that there are no special circumstances or reasons that\nwould warrant that these three custodial sentences be served concurrently.[54]In addition, I am imposing fines totaling $5232 for all seven\nconvictions, of which $4500 is for the four driving while under suspension\nconvictions.I do not find it necessary to impose a prohibition against\ndriving, since he automatically receives a period of suspension of his driving\nprivileges for a period totalling two years under s. 53(3) of the H.T.A.\nupon conviction for the four driving while under suspension offences.[55]Although community service was suggested by both the prosecution\nand the defence as a sanction for rehabilitative purposes, I have instead\ndetermined that the objectives of specific deterrence for this particular\noffender and for the particular circumstances of the seven offences and his\npast driving record required a custodial sentence, a period of probation and\nsignificant fines.These sanctions would still send the appropriate message of\ndenunciation and deterrence to others and to Kang about not driving while his\ndriver’s licence is suspended.Incarcerating Kang will also achieve the\nobjective of specifically deterring him from abusing his driving privileges in Ontario.[56]For a different offender, community service might have been the\nappropriate sanction to achieve these sentencing objectives.Furthermore,\nsince Kang will be serving a custodial sentence, which is already the most\nsevere penalty I could impose on Kang, imposing additional hours of community\nservice would be excessive and against the principle of totality.Moreover,\ncommunity service would be more appropriate for someone unlike Kang, where\nincarceration would severely disrupt family relations or employment or be\nharmful to the offender’s health or who had less of a driving record.[57]In addition, ordering him to attend counseling and to not attend\ncasinos is not appropriate in this case, as his original counselling with his\ndoctor was part of his domestic assault conviction charge and his attendance at\ncasinos have little bearing on or contributed to his offences of driving while\nunder suspension.11.DISPOSITION[58]Therefore, after considering the relevant factors, the\ncircumstances of the offender, the fit and proper sentences for Kang, who is\nguilty of committing seven offences under the Highway Traffic Act are\nthe following:(i) Speeding 86 k.p.h. in a 50 k.p.h. zone on August\n7, 2005Upon\nconviction for this speeding offence of August 7, 2005, I am directed under s.\n128(14)(c) of the H.T.A. to impose a fine of $252.The\noffender has 6 months to pay this fine.(ii) Driving while under suspension on August 7, 2005For\nthis conviction of driving while under suspension of August 7, 2005, I sentence\nKihwan Kang to pay a fine of $2000 with 12 months to pay this fine.(iii) Speeding 140 k.p.h. in a 100 k.p.h. zone on\nOctober 5, 2005Upon\nconviction for this speeding offence of October 5, 2005, I am directed under s.\n128(14)(c) of the H.T.A. to impose a fine of $280.The offender\nhas 6 months to pay this fine.(iv) Driving while under suspension on October 5, 2005For\nthis conviction of driving while under suspension of October 5, 2005, I\nsentence Kihwan Kang to serve a period of imprisonment for 10 days to be\nserved consecutively and to pay a fine of $2500 with 12 months to pay\nthis fine.(v) Driving while under suspension on November 14,\n2005 (Niagara)For\nthis conviction of driving while under suspension of November 14, 2005, I\nsentence Kihwan Kang to serve a period of imprisonment for 15 days to be\nserved consecutively.(vi) Failing to stop for a red light on December 18,\n2005For\nthis failing to stop for a red light conviction, I sentence Kihwan Kang to a fine\nof $200 with 6 months to pay the fine.(vii) Driving while under suspension on December 18,\n2005For\nthis conviction of driving while under suspension of December 18, 2005, I\nsentence Kihwan Kang to serve a period of imprisonment for 20 days to be\nserved consecutively and upon completion a term of probation for two years\nwith conditions.CONDITIONS OF PROBATION[59]I impose the following conditions in Kihwan Kang’s probation\norder, which I consider reasonable, appropriate and adequate to meet any\nconcerns about Kihwan Kang committing similar offences under the Highway\nTraffic Act.Also, these conditions would adequately protect the public\nand assist in his rehabilitation:(a)The probation order will commence on the day\nfollowing the completion of the custodial sentences.It will be for a period\nof two years with the following conditions:(1)The Offender shall not commit the\nsame offence or any related or similar offence, or any offence under a statute\nof Canada or Ontario or any other province of Canada that is punishable by imprisonment.(2)The Offender shall appear before\nthe court as and when required.(3)The Offender shall notify the\ncourt of any change in the Offender’s address.Dated at the City of Toronto\non

Cornell of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting without a jury, on\nJune 12, 2013 and the sentence imposed by Justice Cornell on October 4, 2013.Cronk J.A.:[1]On October 6, 2011, after a police investigation\ninto suspected drug trafficking in the City of Sudbury, the appellant Jahvar\nMarshall and two other individuals – Raymond Khan and Catherine Gagan – were\narrested and jointly charged with possession of a loaded prohibited firearm.At the time, all three individuals were enmeshed in the world of drugs.[2]Police surveillance established that the\nappellant and Khan, Gagan and others were at Gagan’s Sudbury apartment on\nOctober 6, 2011.Information provided by a confidential informant and police\nsurveillance at the apartment suggested that the apartment was the site of\nongoing drug deals.The appellant and Khan were both arrested during the\ncourse of the afternoon and early evening.At approximately 8:00 p.m., the police\nexecuted a search warrant for the apartment and discovered the gun in a black\nLacoste bag in a closet near the back door of the apartment.Gagan and another\nindividual, who were in the apartment, were then arrested.[3]Photographs of Khan holding the gun were found\non Khan’s cell phone following his arrest.However, Khan claimed that the gun\nbelonged to the appellant.He said that, before his arrest, the appellant had\ngiven him the gun while they were at a shopping mall together.Khan took photographs\nof himself, holding the gun, with his cell phone.Khan said that he did so\nbecause it was “cool”.Khan maintained that, after the photographs were taken,\nhe returned the gun to the appellant and never saw it again.[4]Gagan also disavowed any knowledge or possession\nof the gun.[5]Following negotiations with the Crown, Khan\npleaded guilty to the lesser charge of possessing a prohibited weapon on\nOctober 6, 2011, in the City of Sudbury, while he was prohibited from doing so.This was the same day that the appellant was alleged to have possessed the same\ngun.Khan received a sentence of 90 days’ in jail – a significantly lower\nsentence than that faced by him on the original charge of possession of a\nloaded prohibited firearm.[6]No DNA or fingerprint evidence connected\nthe appellant to the gun.The Crown’s case against the appellant rested\nprimarily on the evidence of Khan and Gagan, both of whom testified for the\nCrown.Their evidence linked the appellant to possession of the black Lacoste\nbag on October 6, 2011 and on prior occasions, and to possession of the gun.[7]The appellant testified.He acknowledged\nownership of the black Lacoste bag but denied any knowledge of the gun.The\ntrial judge rejected his evidence and accepted the Crown’s evidence as credible\nand reliable.[8]The trial judge convicted the appellant of\npossession of a loaded prohibited firearm and sentenced him to three and\none-half years’ imprisonment, less credit for 18 months’ pre-sentence custody.On the same day, the appellant was also sentenced to one year in jail for an\nunrelated conviction for possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking,\nconsecutive to his sentence on the firearm offence, and to 60 days’\nimprisonment for two counts of breach of his recognizance of bail, concurrent\nto the other sentences imposed.In total, the appellant received a sentence of\n36 months in jail, after 18 months’ credit for\npre-sentence custody.A DNA and various other ancillary orders were also\nmade.[9]The appellant\nappeals from his conviction and sentence on his firearm conviction.A.Conviction\nAppeal[10]The appellant\nraises three grounds of appeal in support of his conviction appeal.(1)Credibility\nAssessments – Crown Witnesses[11]The appellant\nargues that the trial judge erred in his assessment of Gagan’s credibility by\nfailing to apply a proper Vetrovec caution to her testimony: Vetrovec v. The Queen, 1982 CanLII 20 (SCC), [1982] 1 S.C.R. 811.In particular, the trial judge erred by\nfailing to appreciate that Gagan, like Khan, had a motive to lie because she\nwas also charged with possession of a loaded prohibited firearm.Gagan, therefore,\nhad an incentive to distance herself from any knowledge of the gun, in order to\ngain advantage in respect of her own outstanding charge.[12]I would reject\nthis ground of appeal.[13]The trial judge\nrecognized that Khan had a “significant incentive to assist the Crown in return\nfor a substantially reduced sentence.”He made no mention of such an incentive\non Gagan’s part.[14]However, the trial\njudge was aware that the charge against Gagan remained outstanding at the time\nof the appellant’s trial.Further, in contrast to Khan, there was no evidence of\nany plea arrangements between Gagan and the Crown or of any prospect for more\nlenient treatment of her by the Crown if she agreed to testify for the Crown at\nthe appellant’s trial.The trial judge was also alert to Gagan’s limited prior\ncriminal record.[15]The trial\njudge’s reasons confirm that he appreciated that Vetrovec\nconsiderations applied to both Khan and Gagan’s evidence.He stated that: “[w]hen\nconsidering the evidence of Khan and Gagan, I am mindful of the concerns that\nwere expressed in R. v. Vetrovec.”[16]The trial judge\nwas not obliged to expressly advert to all the reasons warranting a cautious evaluative\napproach to Gagan’s credibility.There is no requirement in a judge-alone\ntrial, like this one, that the trial judge address Vetrovec\nconcerns in the same manner as he or she would in instructing a jury.A Vetrovec\ncaution is intended to alert a jury to the dangers of relying on the evidence\nof ‘unsavoury’ witnesses.Trial judges are well aware of these dangers.[17]In this case,\nthe trial judge expressly instructed himself to assess Gagan’s evidence in\naccordance with Vetrovec principles.In light of this explicit caution,\nI see no reason to conclude that, in assessing Gagan’s credibility, the trial\njudge then lost sight of Gagan’s potential self-interest or other possible\nfrailties in her evidence.[18]The trial judge\nfound that Gagan’s evidence was credible and reliable, for reasons that are\nsupported by the evidentiary record.His credibility-based findings regarding\nher testimony attract considerable deference from this court.I see no basis\nfor appellate interference with them.[19]The appellant\nalso maintains that the trial judge erred by finding that aspects of Khan and\nGagan’s evidence were confirmatory.[20]I disagree.[21]The trial judge\nmade no finding that Khan and Gagan’s evidence was entirely confirmatory.Instead, he found that:The evidence of Khan\nand Gagan with respect to collateral issues such as the presence of other\nindividuals and the chronology of events was largely consistent.In all important aspects, the evidence offered by Gagan and Khan\ntended to confirm and support the evidence offered by the other.[Emphasis added.][22]These findings\nwere open to the trial judge on the evidentiary record.Gagan testified that the\nappellant had expressed concerns, as a drug dealer, about his personal safety\nand need for protection.Khan also said that the appellant was concerned about\nhis safety.This evidence was not peripheral.It bore directly on the\nappellant’s motive for acquiring a gun and bringing it into Gagan’s home, a\nlocation from which he admittedly sold drugs on the day in question and on\nprior occasions.On the evidence, it was also a venue from which various third\nparties came and went with apparent ease.[23]Khan and Gagan\nalso testified about the appellant’s connection to the Lacoste bag where the\ngun was discovered.Khan claimed that the appellant was carrying the bag on\nOctober 6, 2011 and that he had seen the appellant use the bag on many earlier occasions.Gagan testified to similar effect.She said that the appellant had the Lacoste\nbag with him when he attended at her apartment on October 6, 2011 and that he\n“always” carried it with him.[24]This evidence\nwas probative of the identity of the owner of the Lacoste bag and whether the\nappellant was in possession of it on the day in question.It also undercut the\nappellant’s claim at trial that, although he had the bag with him at Gagan’s apartment\non October 6, 2011, he had simply left it there, for no apparent reason and\nwithout any settled intention of returning to Gagan’s apartment to retrieve it,\nwhen he and his girlfriend left the apartment for lunch.[25]The appellant\nmaintains that there were two significant discrepancies between Khan and\nGagan’s evidence.First, he submits that, based on Gagan’s description of the\ntiming of her discussion with the appellant about his self-protection concerns,\nthe appellant had the gun for less than one month prior to his arrest.Khan,\nhowever, suggested that the appellant had the gun for at least several months.[26]It was open to\nthe trial judge to attach little weight to this discrepancy.Neither witness\npurported to know when the appellant had acquired a gun.Khan was uncertain of\nthe exact time when the appellant showed him the gun.Gagan testified merely\nto her own belief that the appellant had not yet acquired a gun when they\ndiscussed his personal safety concerns.Further, the appellant did not tell\nher whether he had actually purchased a gun.[27]The second\nalleged discrepancy stressed by the appellant concerns Khan and Gagan’s differing\nversions of when and how frequently they had met prior to the day of their\narrests.Nothing material turns on this issue.Any inconsistency between Khan\nand Gagan’s testimony on this issue did not detract from their evidence that\nthe appellant was selling drugs from Gagan’s apartment, that he owned the\nLacoste bag, and that he was concerned for his safety.(2)Alleged\nMisapprehension of Evidence[28]The appellant’s\nsecond ground of appeal concerns the trial judge’s treatment of the evidence of\nKhan’s plea of guilty to the charge of possession of a prohibited weapon on\nOctober 6, 2011, in the City of Sudbury, while he was prohibited from doing\nso.The appellant submits that the trial judge misapprehended this evidence by\nfailing to appreciate that Khan’s plea to this offence constituted a prior\ninconsistent statement.It was, the appellant says, an admission by Khan that\nhe was in possession of the gun on October 6, 2011, the same day that the\nappellant was found to be in possession of the same gun, in contrast to Khan’s denial\nat the appellant’s trial of possession of the gun on that day.[29]Again, I\ndisagree.[30]In pleading to\nthe lesser charge of possession of a prohibited weapon while he was prohibited\nfrom doing so, Khan admitted the essential elements of that offence, as\nparticularized by the Crown.These particulars included the date and place of\npossession of the prohibited weapon – October 6, 2011, in the City of Sudbury.[31]However, no transcript\nof Khan’s plea proceeding or any details of the statement of facts on which\nKhan entered his plea were tendered as evidence at the appellant’s trial.Nor\nwas Khan cross-examined on the details of what transpired at his plea\nproceeding.Instead, he was asked only whether he had pleaded guilty to the\ncharge in question, as framed in the indictment against him.He replied in the\naffirmative.No cross-examination of Khan took place regarding whether he\nunderstood the significance of the date on his indictment, whether he accepted\nthat the offence to which he was pleading took place on October 6, 2011, or as\nto any of the events at the plea proceeding.[32]This gap in the\nevidence is critical to this ground of appeal.The issue at the appellant’s\ntrial in relation to Khan’s prior plea was whether that plea had any\nsignificance to the assessment of Khan’s credibility in light of his denial, at\nthe appellant’s trial, of possession of the handgun found in the Lacoste bag.In the absence of the transcript of Khan’s plea proceeding and any\ncross-examination of him concerning that proceeding, the significance of his\nprior plea was left entirely undeveloped.In that undeveloped state, the fact\nof the plea was uninformative regarding Khan’s credibility.[33]There are many\nreasons why an accused may elect to plead guilty to a pending charge.On the\nevidentiary record before the trial judge, Khan’s reasons for doing so are\nunknown.Moreover, the transcript of Khan’s plea proceeding or further\ncross-examination of him regarding the events at his plea proceeding may have\nprovided an explanation for the date of his admitted possession of the gun.They may also have disclosed an amendment to the particulars set out in the indictment\nagainst Khan.The record before the trial judge, however, was entirely silent\non these issues.So is the record on appeal.[34]It was\nincumbent on the appellant, as the person seeking to rely on an asserted prior\ninconsistent statement by Khan, to establish that the statement in question\nwas, in fact, a prior inconsistent statement.In the circumstances here, the\nappellant failed to do so.[35]The trial judge\nwas aware of Khan’s guilty plea.On the state of the record before him, I can\nfind no fault in his failure to treat Khan’s guilty plea as a prior\ninconsistent statement capable of detracting from Khan’s credibility.In the\nabsence of further evidence on the issue, the trial judge was entitled to\nconclude that Khan’s guilty plea related to his possession of the gun at the\ntime of his cell phone photographs, and not possession of the gun at Gagan’s\napartment on October 6, 2011.[36]In my opinion,\nthis ground of appeal fails.(3)Alleged Uneven\nLevel of Scrutiny[37]Finally, the\nappellant submitted in his factum that the trial judge erred by applying a\nharsher level of scrutiny to the appellant’s evidence than that applied to the\nCrown’s witnesses.[38]The appellant\ndid not press this submission in oral argument at the appeal hearing.In my\nview, this was prudent.While it is an error to subject defence evidence at a\ncriminal trial to a stricter standard of scrutiny than that applied to the\nprosecution’s evidence, this court has repeatedly emphasized that it is\ndifficult to make this argument successfully.For example, in R. v. Howe (2005),\n2005 CanLII 253 (ON CA), 192 C.C.C. (3d) 480 (Ont. C.A.), Doherty J.A. explained, at para. 59:It is not enough to\nshow that a different trial judge could have reached a different credibility\nassessment, or that the trial judge failed to say something that he could have\nin assessing the respective credibility of the [Crown’s witnesses] and the\naccused, or that he failed to expressly set out legal principles relevant to\nthat credibility assessment.To succeed in this kind of argument, the\nappellant must point to something in the reasons of the trial judge or perhaps\nelsewhere in the record that make it clear that the trial judge had applied\ndifferent standards in assessing the evidence of the appellant and the [Crown’s\nwitnesses].[39]More recently,\nthis court observed in R. v. Aird, 2013 ONCA 447 (CanLII), 307 O.A.C. 183, at para.\n39:The “different\nstandards of scrutiny” argument is a difficult argument to succeed on in an\nappellate court.It is difficult for two related reasons: credibility findings\nare the province of the trial judge and attract a very high degree of deference\non appeal; and appellate courts invariably view this argument with skepticism,\nseeing it as a veiled invitation to reassess the trial judge’s credibility\ndeterminations.[40]In this case,\nthe trial judge’s reasons reveal that he reviewed the core aspects of the\nappellant’s account of events, as well as the manner in which he testified and\nthe import of the discrepancies, inconsistencies and contradictions that\nemerged in his testimony, in the context of the evidence as a whole.He noted\nthe appellant’s attempts to minimize his culpability and his failure to testify\nin a forthright manner.The trial judge concluded that, in several instances,\nthe appellant appeared to have been untruthful in his evidence.He provided\ncogent reasons for rejecting the appellant’s evidence and accepting that of the\nCrown’s witnesses.[41]The trial\njudge’s credibility assessments were squarely within his domain.As I have\nsaid, his credibility findings attract considerable deference from this court.I see no basis upon which to conclude that his evaluation of the appellant’s\nevidence was less than even-handed or disproportionately rigorous.(4)Disposition of\nConviction Appeal[42]For the reasons\ngiven, I would dismiss the conviction appeal.B.Sentence\nAppeal(1)Fitness of Sentence[43]At the time of\nsentencing, the Supreme Court’s decision in R.\nv. Nur, 2015 SCC 15 (CanLII), 385\nD.L.R. (4th) 1 had not\nbeen released.In Nur, the Supreme\nCourt struck down, as unconstitutional, the three-year mandatory minimum\nsentence for the offence of possession of a loaded restricted firearm, as\nprovided for in s. 95 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46.There is no dispute that, in light\nof Nur, this court is entitled to\nreview the three and one-half years’ sentence of imprisonment imposed on the\nappellant.[44]The appellant\nsubmits that, absent a statutory mandatory minimum sentence, a sentence of\nthree and one-half years in jail is demonstrably unfit in this case.He\ncontends that given his youth at the time of sentencing (23 years old), his\nlack of a criminal record, his candour at trial in acknowledging his involvement\nin the drug trade, and his positive rehabilitative prospects, a sentence of\nbetween two and one-half to three years in jail is appropriate.[45]The appellant\nfurther submits that a sentence in the range he proposes would meet the\nsentencing goals of deterrence and denunciation, while giving proper effect to\nthe parity principle and the considerations held by this court to govern the\nsentencing of a youthful first offender: see R. v. Borde (2003),\n2003 CanLII 4187 (ON CA), 63 O.R. (3d) 417 (C.A.).[46]I would not accept\nthese submissions.[47]In R. v. Nur,\n2013 ONCA 677 (CanLII), 117 O.R. (3d) 401, at para. 206, this court held that, the s. 95\nstatutory mandatory minimum aside, offenders who engage in s. 95 offences at\nthe “true crime end of the s. 95 spectrum of offences” should continue to\nreceive exemplary sentences that emphasize deterrence and denunciation.Nur provides,\nat para. 206, that: “[i]ndividuals who have loaded, restricted or prohibited\nfirearms that they have no business possessing anywhere or at any time, and who\nare engaged in criminal conduct or conduct that poses a danger to others” will\nstill attract such sentences, regardless of the constitutionality of the\nthree-year minimum penalty.[48]The appellant\nfalls within this category of offenders.By the appellant’s own admission, he\nwas present in Sudbury at Gagan’s apartment on October 6, 2011 for the express\npurpose of trafficking in drugs.He sold at least 15 grams of cocaine that\nday.He was in possession of a prohibited loaded handgun at a location where\ndrug deals were occurring, several individuals were present in addition to Khan\nand Gagan, and the potential for violence was high.On the trial judge’s\nfindings, the appellant then left the loaded handgun in his Lacoste bag at\nGagan’s apartment, while he and his girlfriend went out for lunch.[49]There can be no\ndoubt that this type of crime, in the circumstances described above, is an\noffence at the “true crime” end of the s. 95 spectrum of offences described by\nthis court in Nur.Denunciation, deterrence and protection\nof the public are unquestionably the paramount principles of sentencing\nimplicated for such a crime.[50]Additional\naggravating factors are also in play.The appellant’s pre-sentence report\nindicates that he “seems to minimize and rationalize” his weapons offence and\nthat he sees no “need to make changes in his life nor is he open to\ncounselling”.Further, while on bail for the predicate offence, he was\narrested for and eventually pleaded guilty to one count of possession of\ncocaine for the purpose of trafficking (60 grams of cocaine having a street\nvalue of approximately $5,000 to $6,000), and two counts of breach of his recognizance\nof bail.It was for these additional offences that the appellant was also\nsentenced at his sentencing hearing on his firearm conviction.[51]I agree with\nthe Crown’s submission that the appellant’s commission of a serious\ndrug-related offence while on bail for his weapons offence, coupled with his\nnegative pre-sentence report, strongly undercut any claim that the sentence imposed\nwill “crush” the appellant’s prospects for rehabilitation.[52]Nor, in my\nview, does the sentence imposed offend the Borde first offender sentencing principle or\nparity considerations.[53]The trial judge\nconsidered the appellant’s youthfulness.While the sentence imposed would be\nthe appellant’s first penitentiary sentence, his crime was serious and\ncommitted in the course of his commission of other admitted drug-related\ncrimes.Although the courts should impose the shortest possible sentence in\ncases involving a youthful first time offender, the sentence must be consistent\nwith the relevant sentencing principles, including proportionality to the\ngravity of the offence.As I have already said, the appellant’s offence was on\nthe true crime end of the s. 95 spectrum.A sentence of three and one-half\nyears is fit in the circumstances.[54]Further, any\ncomparison to Khan’s sentence following his guilty plea for possession of a\nprohibited weapon is inapt.Khan was convicted of a different offence and\ntestified for the Crown at the appellant’s trial.Importantly, as before the\ntrial judge, the full factors taken into account on Khan’s sentencing are\nunknown on the record before this court.And, as the Crown emphasizes,\ndisparate sentences, even for the same offence, do not violate the parity\nprinciple so long as they are justified in all the circumstances.[55]I note that in Nur, both\nthis court and the Supreme Court upheld a sentence of 40 months in prison for a\n19-year old first offender who had pleaded guilty at trial and was found to\nhave had good rehabilitative prospects.[56]Finally, the\nsentence imposed is well within the range of sentences upheld by this court for\nweapons offences committed in association with drug crimes.The statutory\nmandatory minimum sentence aside, I regard the appellant’s three and one-half\nyear sentence of imprisonment for his firearm conviction as entirely fit.(2)Disposition of Sentence\nAppeal[57]Accordingly,\nfor the reasons given, I would grant leave to appeal sentence and dismiss the\nsentence appeal.Released:“EAC”“E.A.\nCronk J.A.”“OCT 15 2015”“I\nagree Gloria Epstein J.A.”“I\nagree David Brown J.A.”"}

A sentence of 5 years consecutive to the sentence that was\nimposed on July 4, 2000 is substituted for the concurrent sentence of 3 1/2\nyears imposed by the sentencing judge.LARLEE, J.A.[1]This is a\nsentence appeal. On February 18, 1998, the Respondent, J.F., committed an\naggravated assault on L.F.. He pleaded guilty to this offence and the trial\njudge sentenced him to three and one half years concurrent to another sentence\nhe had received for an aggravated sexual assault.[2]The Crown\nappeals the sentence and submits that the trial judge committed several errors\nentitling this Court to intervene. It submits that the sentence imposed should\nnot be concurrent to the other sentence because there is no nexus between the\ntwo crimes. Secondly that although the offender is an aboriginal and s.\n718.2(e) of the Criminal Code of Canada, R.S.C.\n1985, c. C-46 should be considered, the seriousness of the crime merits an\nincreased sentence. And finally it submits that the sentence imposed in the\ncircumstances is demonstrably unfit. At the hearing we granted leave to appeal,\nallowed the appeal and substituted a sentence of 5 years to be served\nconsecutively for the three and one half-year concurrent sentence that the\ntrial judge imposed.These are the reasons in support of that decision.[3]On February 18, 1998, the Respondent, J.F.\nand the victim L.F., two friends both of whom are aboriginal, were drinking\ntogether and as a result were heavily intoxicated. While traveling with others,\ntheir vehicle got stuck in the mud in a wooded area. BothJ.F. and the victim\ndecided to leave on foot to get help. While walking on the roadway J.F.,\nwithout provocation, spontaneously attacked L.F. with a knife. The victim is\nsignificantly bigger than J.F. and can defend himself in normal circumstances,\nbut in this case, he was unable to do so because he was taken totally by surprise by the attack. J.F.\nstabbed L.F. in the facial area causing multiple injuries the most serious of\nwhich was to the inner portion of the left eye.After the attack, and while\nbleeding profusely, L.F. was able to go to a third party's residence to seek\nhelp. He knocked on the door and then collapsed on the floor. Dr. LaPierre, who\nwas the physician on-call at the Moncton City Hospital, described L.F.'\ninjuries as follows:He suffered multiple facial\nlacerations including lacerations to his left upper lid, his ocular globe as\nwell as his left cheek area. He was found to have a full thickness corneal and\nsclera laceration extending from the 10'[sic] clock median down approximately\n22 mm into the sclera (the eye itself).[4]A retina specialist\nperformed two major surgeries because of the retinal damage. At the time of the\nsentence, more than two years after the attack, his prognosis had not yet been\ndetermined and he could require further surgery. L.F. lost 60-70% of his\neyesight in the left eye without chance of further improvement with the\nprognosis of possible complete loss of eyesight in the eye.[5]The other\noffence for which J.F. was sentenced, which is relevant to this appeal, is one\nthat occurred after the assault on L.F. but before he was sentenced for it.On\nJuly 4, 2000, J.F. was sentenced to a period of incarceration of two years for\nan aggravated sexual assault he committed on his common law spouse. That\noffence occurred on June 10, 2000 when J.F. whipped his spouse repeatedly with\na belt compelling her against her will to perform fellatio on him. Also on July\n4, 2000, J.F. was further sentenced to two months in jail to be served\nconcurrently for having breached his undertaking to the Court to keep the peace\nand be of good behavior.[6]Then on December 4,\n2000, the Respondent pleaded guilty to the offence under appeal and the\nsentencing judge imposed on him a period of incarceration of three and a half\nyears. The Court ordered that the sentence be served concurrently to any time\nhe was serving.[7]Intervention by this\nCourt is justified in this case because the sentencing judge erred in imposing\na concurrent sentence when there was no temporal nexus between the two offences\nthat J.F. committed. He committed two separate offences against two entirely\ndifferent victims and the events occurred two years apart. The fact that there\nwas no nexus between the two offences has a bearing on the question of the\ntotality of the sentence. It is not appropriate to impose a concurrent sentence\nunder these circumstances. (See R. v. Johnson (D.) (1996), 1996 CanLII 4835 (NB CA), 182\nN.B.R. (2d) 373 (C.A.) and R.P. Nadin-Davis, Sentencing in Canada\n(Toronto: Carswell, 1982) at 396.)[8]In arriving at the\nsentence that he imposed the sentencing judge did take into consideration s.\n718.2(e) of the Code and the case of R. v. Gladue, 1999 CanLII 679 (SCC), [1999]\n1 S.C.R. 688. However he went on to say that R. v. Wells, 2000 SCC 10 (CanLII), [2000]\n1 S.C.R. 207 was of no assistance because s. 742 had no application in this\ncase. I am of the opinion that the cases of Gladue and Wells\nhave to be considered together when sentencing aboriginal people who have\ncommitted crimes of this nature. They are pertinent in this case not only\nbecause the offender is an aboriginal, but also because they comment on\naboriginal offenders who have committed serious offences.[9]In R. v.\nGladue, Cory and Iacobucci JJ. pointed out in paragraph 13 of a summary\nof the decision at para. 93:It is unreasonable to assume\nthat aboriginal peoples do not believe in the importance of traditional\nsentencing goals such as deterrence, denunciation, and separation, where\nwarranted. In this context, generally, the more serious and violent the crime,\nthe more likely it will be as a practical matter that the terms of imprisonment\nwill be the same for similar offences and offenders, whether the offender is\naboriginal or non-aboriginal.[10]In R. v.\nWells, supra, Iacobucci J. further clarifies that which was said\nin Gladue at para. 40:However, the scope of s.\n718.2(e), as it applies to all offenders, restricts the adoption of\nalternatives to incarceration to those sanctions that are \"reasonable in\nthe circumstances\".Again, as was expressly stated in Gladue, the\nCourt in no way intended to suggest that as a general rule, the greatest weight\nis to be given to principles of restorative justice, and less weight accorded\nto goals such as denunciation and deterrence.Indeed, such a general rule\nwould contradict the individual or case-by-case nature of the sentencing process,\nwhich proceeds on the basis of inquiring whether, given the particular facts of\nthe offence, the offender, the victim and the community, the sentence is fit in\nthe circumstances.[11]In R. v.\nPangman, 2001 MBCA 64 (CanLII) and [2001] M.J. No. 217 (C.A.), online: QL (MJ),\nJustice Steel reiterates that for serious offences aboriginal offenders will be\ntreated like other offenders:[para. 43] While no categories of offences\nare exempt from consideration, courts have recognized that, depending on the\ncircumstances, sentences for serious offences may well not be ameliorated by\nthe principles arising from R. v. Gladue. There are some serious offences and\nsome offenders for which and for whom separation, denunciation and deterrence\nare fundamentally relevant (R. v. Gladue at para. 78).This point is also made\nin R. v. Sackanay(2000), 2000 CanLII 1840 (ON CA), 47 O.R. (3d) 612 (C.A.) at para. 11:Admittedly, both Gladue and the later Supreme\nCourt of Canada decision in R. v. Wells, [[2000] 1 S.C.R. 207, 2000 SCC 10 (CanLII)]\nacknowledge that sentences should not be automatically reduced for aboriginal\noffenders, and that for more serious and violent offences sentences are likely\nto be similar whether the offender is aboriginal or not.[12]As Justice Iacobucci\npoints out in Wells the sentencing process is based on an\nindividual or case by case approach. The nature of the offence, and the\ncircumstances of the offender, the victim and the community must be balanced.\nThe application of s. 718.2(e) is one factor to be taken into consideration in\nthis global consideration of the principles of sentencing.[13]The crime for which J.F.\nwas sentenced was a violent unprovoked stabbing on a friend who was unable to\ndefend himself. In his victim impact statement, L.F. stated that at first he\nwanted to seek revenge for the attack, but then decided to leave it to the\njustice system to deal with him.[14]The Respondent is 23\nyears of age. He is the father of three children and has the support of a\ncommon-law wife. According to the sentencing judge he is enrolled in programs\nin prison to help him deal with his alcohol dependency and propensity for\nviolence. He is following upgrading courses and courses on skills\napprenticeship and carpentry work. Tempered with that the offender in this case\nhas a youth record. I set it out here for reference:Date of OffencePlace ofDate\nofChargeSentenceOffenceSentenceYouth countRichibuctoJuly\n29, 1991264.1(1)(a)Probation 1 yearCCCYouth courtRichibuctoMarch\n2,86(1)(a)I month secure custody each charge\nconsecutive1994CCC\nx 2and probation two years and prohibited firearmsand\n87 CCCammunitionorexpl. substances for five years.September 10,March\n22,430 CCCConditional Discharge - 919981999monthsJuly 12, 1999July\n13, 1999733.1 CCCFine $0.00; Surcharge $35.00; Probation\n- 5months\n(super.); Suspended SentenceMay 07, 2000Big Cove, NBJuly\n04, 2000266(a) CCCJail - 9 months concurrent to any othersentence\npresently being servedMay 07, 2000Big Cove, NBJuly\n04, 2000145(3)(a)CCCJail - 2 months concurrent to any othersentence\npresently being servedJune 10, 2000Big Cove, NBJuly\n04, 2000272 CCCJail - 2 years145(3)(a)Jail - 2 months concurrent to any\notherCCCsentence presently being served[15]This record can be\nused to show a violent course of conduct and the propensity J.F. has for\nviolence. It also can be considered with respect to the possibility of his\nrehabilitation.[16]Because of the\nviciousness of the attack and the propensity of J.F. to commit violent acts, I\nam of the view that he must be treated as other offenders for this same type of\ncrime. Compared to sentences other offenders have received for serious crimes,\nmost notably aggravated assault, the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge\nhere was demonstrably unfit. The goals of denunciation and deterrence cannot be\nsacrificed to the principle of restorative justice. This offender must be\nseparated from society for a long period of time. Section 718.2 of the Code\ninsists that a Court that imposes a sentence shall take into account the\nprinciple that a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar\noffences committed in similar circumstances. For that purpose reference can be\nmade to a number of recent decisions of this Court. See R. v. Gallant\n(S.F.) (1992), 1992 CanLII 4079 (NB CA), 126 N.B.R. (2d) 421 (N.B.C.A.), R. v. Wu (M.F.)\n(1994), 1994 CanLII 6468 (NB CA), 145 N.B.R. (2d) 107 (N.B.C.A.), R. v. Canney (R.H.) (1995),\n1995 CanLII 6994 (NB CA), 163 N.B.R. (2d) 161 (N.B.C.A.), and R. v. Joyce (K.R.) (1998),\n1998 CanLII 12216 (NB CA), 203 N.B.R. (2d) 1 (N.B.C.A.).[17]The trial judge\nconsidered three decisions of this Court R. v. Nash-Levy (B.M.)\n(1998), 1998 CanLII 12230 (NB CA), 207 N.B.R. (2d) 45, R. v. Zinck (T.R.) (1999), 209 N.B.R.\n(2d) 257 and R. v. Cormier (D.) (1999), 1999 CanLII 13118 (NB CA), 209 N.B.R. (2d) 289 that\ndeal with the imposition of the half-time eligibility parole rule pursuant to\ns. 743.6 of the Code. At para. 16 Cormier sets out\nthe factors to be considered before a judge orders that the portion of the\nsentence that must be served before an offender may be released on full parole\nis on half of the sentence:[...] What is required is for the Crown\nprosecutor to persuade the sentencing judge that the criteria set out in the\nsection have been satisfied by the facts of the case. Parliament has set out\nthe criteria for delay of parole in the section.These criteria are the\ndenunciation by society of the offences or that it is necessary in order to\nachieve an objective of general or specific deterrence.Factors which must be\ntaken into account, once the sentencing judge determines that any of these\ncriteria are met, include the circumstances of the commission of the offence,\nand the character and circumstances of the accused, which may include, pursuant\nto s. 743.6(2) of the Code, a consideration of the offender's prospects\nfor rehabilitation.These are the factors, which according to the section, are\nto be taken into account; it is not for sentencing judges to improvise except\nin the most unusual circumstances.[18]In this case the\nsentencing judge was persuaded because of the possibility of the rehabilitation\nof the Respondent not to invoke the section. He obviously reasoned in this case\nthat the application of the section was not necessary to achieve the objective\nof general and specific deterrence. In so doing he made no error.[19]For these reasons\nleave is granted to appeal sentence and the appeal is allowed. A sentence of 5\nyears consecutive to the sentence that was imposed on July 4, 2000 is\nsubstituted for the concurrent sentence of 3 1/2 years imposed by the\nsentencing judge._____________________________MARGARET\nE.L.

J.(SENTENCE)INTRODUCTION:[1]On March 1, 2015,\nMr. White pushed his spouse.The police were contacted.They spoke to Mrs.\nWhite.Mrs. White told the police that she did not want a charge laid. The\npolice told Mrs. White they had a “zero tolerance” policy and Mr. White was\ncharged with the offence of assault, contrary to section 266 of the Criminal\nCode of Canada, R.S.C. 1985.[2]The Crown\nproceeded with the charge and Mr. White pleaded guilty to the offence.The\nCrown proceeded by way of summary conviction.[3]At the sentence\nhearing, Crown counsel indicated that Mrs. White had been in contact with the\nCrown’s office and had requested that the charge against her husband be\nwithdrawn.Ms. Dwyer indicated that Mrs. White had indicated that she has been\nmarried to Mr. White for twenty-nine years and this was the first time such an\nincident had occurred.Ms. Dwyer also indicated that Mrs. White told the\nCrown’s office that she wished to have contact with her husband.[4]The Crown\nrecommended that a conditional discharge with twelve months of probation be\nimposed. I accepted this recommendation and imposed the sentence requested.\nThese are my reasons for having done so.THE\nPRINCIPLES OF SENTENCING[5]In R.\nv. Knott, 2012\nSCC 42 (CanLII), it was held that \"the purpose and principles of sentencing set out\nin the Criminal Code are meant to take into account\nthe correctional imperative of sentence individualization.\"[6]Section 718 of\nthe Criminal Code states that the fundamental purpose of sentencing\n\"is to contribute...to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just,\npeaceful, and safe society.\"This is to be achieved by imposing sentences\nwhich have, among other objectives, the objectives of:-separating\noffenders from society, where necessary;-denouncing\nunlawful conduct;-general\ndeterrence;-rehabilitation;\nand-the\npromoting of a \"sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgement\nof the harm done to victims and the community.\"[7]Section 718.2(b)\nof the Criminal Code states that \"a sentence should be similar to\nsentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in\nsimilar circumstances.\"[8]Section 718.1 of\nthe Criminal Code states that any sentence imposed must be\n\"proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of\nresponsibility of the offender.\"In R. v. Cluney, 2013 NLCA\n46 (CanLII), the Court of Appeal, at paragraph 16, indicated that the “principle of\nproportionality applies to sentencing for all criminal offences…The appropriate\nrange of sentence is related to the gravity of the offence and the moral\nblameworthiness of the offender.”[9]Section 718.2(a)\nof the Criminal Code indicates that a \"sentence should be increased\nor reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances\nrelating to the offence or the offender.\"In R. v. Briand,\n2010 NLCA 67 (CanLII), [2010]\nN.J. No. 339 (C.A.), the Court of Appeal stressed the importance of\nconsidering an offender's personal circumstances in applying section 718.2(a)\nof the Criminal Code.[10]Section 718.2(d)\nstates that \"an offender should not be deprived of liberty, if less\nrestrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances\" and section\n718.2(e) states that \"all available sanctions other than imprisonment that\nare reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders,\nwith particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.\"[11]In R. v.\nBerner, 2013 BCCA 188 (CanLII), the\nBritish Columbia Court of Appeal noted that broadly “speaking, a sentencing judge looks\nto the conduct and culpability of the offender and punishes the offender for\nthat conduct through the application of the principles and objectives of\ndeterrence, rehabilitation, denunciation and proportionality.”THE CRIMINAL CODE’S DISCHARGE\nPROVISION[12]The Court's authority to\ngrant an offender a discharge is found in section 730(1) of the Criminal\nCode.It states as follows:Where an accused, other than an\norganization, pleads guilty to or is found guilty of an offence, other than an\noffence for which a minimum punishment is prescribed by law or an offence\npunishable by imprisonment for fourteen years or for life, the court before\nwhich the accused appears may, if it considers it to be in the best interests\nof the accused and not contrary to the public interest, instead of convicting\nthe accused, by order direct that the accused be discharged absolutely or on\nthe conditions prescribed in a probation order made under subsection 731(2).[13]Thus,\nthis provision allows the Court to refrain from entering a conviction, despite\nproof that an offence has been committed, if it is satisfied that two\nprerequisites exist.The Court must be satisfied that a discharge is (1) in\nthe best interests of the offender; and (2) not contrary to the public\ninterest.[14]In R.\nv. Elsharawy, (1997), 1997 CanLII 14708 (NL CA), 119 C.C.C. (3d) 565 (N.L.C.A.), the Court of\nAppeal indicated that the first factor \"presupposes that the accused is a\nperson of good character, usually without previous conviction or discharge\"\nand the second factor \"involves a consideration of the principle of\ngeneral deterrence with attention being paid to the gravity of the offence, its\nincidence in the community, public attitudes towards it and public confidence\nin the effective enforcement of the criminal law\" (at paragraph 3).[15]In R. v.\nEdmunds, 2012 NLCA 26 (CanLII), [2012] N.J. No. 177 (C.A.), the accused pleaded guilty\nto one count of breach of trust by a public officer and two counts of theft.\nThe offender, who was employed as a correctional officer, stole monies from two\nprisoners. The sentencing judge imposed a conditional discharge with\ntwenty-four months of probation.The Crown appealed from the sentence\nimposed.[16]The Crown’s appeal\nfrom sentence was dismissed. The Newfoundland and Labrador Court of Appeal\nconcluded that “the Crown has not pointed the Court to any binding or\npersuasive authorities that would suggest that a conditional discharge was a\ndemonstrably unfit and clearly unreasonable sentence in these circumstances.”The Court of Appeal noted, at paragraph 20, that in “some circumstances,\nevidence of particular effects on the offender will be required if the offender\nis relying on such factors.However, a sentencing judge may take judicial\nnotice of the fact that a criminal conviction will have a negative impact on a\nperson's future, whether related to employment opportunities, travel, and so\nforth.”[17]In Edmunds,\nthe Court of Appeal, at paragraph\n22, indicated that the evidence presented at the sentence hearing showed that the\noffender’s “mental illness contributed to his commission of the offence.”The\nCourt of Appeal concluded that as a result “the usefulness and appropriateness\nof specific deterrence is much reduced and the Court may properly place greater\nemphasis on rehabilitation.”[18]In R. v. House,\n[2012] N.J. No. 219 (C.A.), the accused was convicted of the offences of\nassault and unlawfully being in a dwelling house.In concluding that a\nconditional discharge was warranted for both offences, the Court of Appeal indicated\nthat the accused is \"a promising young man who, in his twenties, is still\nmaturing and developing the basis for a productive life including employment\nand relationship opportunities and decisions\" (at paragraph 24):As discussed in Elsharawy,\nin an assessment of whether a conditional discharge is in the best interests of\nMr. House, the first condition presupposes that the accused is a person of good\ncharacter, ordinarily with no previous criminal conviction or discharge. Based\non the above, this supposition is satisfied in this case. As to the need for\npersonal deterrence or rehabilitation, I note that Mr. House was on release,\nwith conditions, on a Promise to Appear prior to his trial, and that he\nobtained judicial interim release, again with conditions, pending determination\nof his appeal. He has been compliant with the terms of release, particularly\nthe requirement to keep the peace and be of good behaviour, for almost four\nyears. Given the nature of the offence and Mr. House's conduct since the offences\nwere committed, personal deterrence and rehabilitation are not matters of\nconcern. Finally, regarding adverse repercussions from a criminal conviction,\nMr. House is a promising young man who, in his twenties, is still maturing and\ndeveloping the basis for a productive life including employment and\nrelationship opportunities and decisions. A criminal record, where such is\nunnecessary for purposes of protection of the public, may result in roadblocks\nin terms of this development. Such a result is to be avoided provided Mr. House\nis otherwise a proper candidate for a conditional discharge.SENTENCING PRECEDENTS[19]In R. v. Fong, [2011]\nN.J. No. 66 (P.C.), the accused assaulted his spouse by striking her with\nthe back of his hand. I endorsed a joint submission and imposed an absolute\ndischarge.[20]In R. v. Wimbleton, [2011]\nN.J. No. 73 (P.C.), the accused assaulted his spouse by grabbing her by\nthe back of her neck.I endorsed a joint submission and imposed a conditional\ndischarge.[21]In R. v. Brushett, [2015]\nN.J. No. 32 (P.C.), the offender struck the victim with a beer bottle.\nThough the offender was young and had no prior convictions, Judge Porter\ndeclined to impose a discharge.[22]In R. v. Flynn, [2015]\nN.J. No. 248 (P.C.), the Crown joined in a joint\nsubmission seeking the granting of a discharge for an offender who had\nparticipated in the spray painting a police officer's private vehicle.ANALYSIS[23]Mr. White assaulted\nhis spouse by pushing her.He has no prior convictions and entered a plea of\nguilty to the offence.The Crown recommended that a conditional discharge be\nimposed.Considering the circumstances of the offence and those of the\noffender, I imposed the sentence recommended.CONCLUSION[24]For the reasons\nprovided, Mr. White is sentenced to a conditional discharge with twelve months\nof probation.[25]Judgment accordingly."}

Lee........................................................................................................................for\nthe CrownD. Embry.........................................................................for\nthe accused Vinothan SriranganathanROBERTSON, J.:[1]The accused has entered pleas of guilt to\nthree charges –1)Mischief Under $5000 by interference with the\nlawful use of an ATM2)Possession of the Forgery Device, i.e. a skimmer\ndevice and3)Possession of a credit card obtained by crime, a\nbank card not in his own name[2]The facts are simple.The accused and\nanother individual were observed manipulating an ATM.Their activities were\nreported to police who determined that a skimmer device and a pin hole camera\nhad been installed on the ATM.Video surveillance captured the installation\nand subsequent investigation located the accused’s fingerprints on the ATM and\nthe card reader or skimmer. The skimmer device and pin hole camera are designed\nto steal debit card data and record the Personal Identification Numbers (PIN)\nof legitimate bank customers, the purpose of which is to subsequently gain\naccess to their accounts and/or to use the data to purchase items.[3]The accused was arrested in the vicinity of\nthe ATM.A search incident to arrest revealed that the accused was in possession\nof a credit card, not in his name and which subsequent investigation,\ndetermined was obtained by crime.[4]The accused is 26, has no criminal record\nand spent 2 days in pre-trial custody.[5]The crown seeks a suspended sentence and 12\nmonths probation on terms.[6]The defence seeks a conditional discharge.It agrees with the appropriateness of the probationary period with the same\nterms as submitted by the crown.[7]Following submissions I asked counsel to provide\nme with case law to support their respective positions.I did so as I felt\nthat neither sentence was within the appropriate range but wished to give\ncounsel the opportunity to support their respective positions.[8]On December 23, 2011 I received casebooks\nfrom both counsel and heard further submissions on sentence.[9]Both counsel submitted that there were few\ncases which are directly relevant to the circumstances of this case as most\nreported decisions regarding installation of skimming devices, of which there\nare few, dealt with broader schemes involving more ATMs, often resulting in significant\nfinancial loss to the financial institutions involved. The cases nevertheless\nare helpful in identifying the potential impact of such crimes on victims of\nhacked accounts and on the banking system in general.[10]Although every case turns on its own facts, no\ncase provided, which admittedly were generally more serious, resulted in either\na conditional discharge or a suspended sentence; all cases resulted in\nincarceration – to be served in an institution or in the community, through a\nconditional sentence.[11]On January 26, I determined that the victim\nof this offence had not be notified of their right to provide a Victim Impact\nStatement and so the matter was further adjourned to allow the crown to inquiry\nas to whether the victim wished to do so.I have today received that statement\nwhich has been made an exhibit.[12]Having reviewed the cases provided as well\nas others referred to in those cases, having received the original and\nsubsequent submissions of counsel as to sentence, and having reviewed the\nVictim Impact Statement, I do not agree that either a conditional discharge or\na suspended sentence is an appropriate sentence.[13]The following is my reasons.[14]Any sentence starts with a consideration of the\nmitigating and aggravating factors.[15]The mitigating factors are:a)The accused has plead guilty.The defence\nnotified the crown in advance of the trial date and the witnesses were not\nrequired to attend court.In addition to a sign of remorse, the guilty plea\nhas saved the witnesses of the necessity of coming to court.b)The accused is 26.He is youthful, although not\na youth.He is a local truck driver.He is a refugee claimant seeking to\nbring his mother and brother from Sri Lanka.c)The accused is a first offender, having no\ncriminal record.d)Only a single installation was involved.Although\nthe crown submits material found in the accused’s automobile would suggest a\nlarger or more extensive involvement, the offence is the accused’s involvement\nin the installation and monitoring of a single installation.e)The accused served 2 days in pre-trial custody\nbefore obtaining bail.[16]The aggravating factors are:a)This is a sophisticated crime involving the\ninstallation of a device to record data and personal information of banking\ncustomers.These devices are not readily available and can only be acquired\nthrough one’s association with illegitimate sources that have the resources to\nacquire the professionally manufactured devices designed specifically to\nreplicate the colour, texture and appearance of the ATMs of specific banks.By\nreplicating the legitimate appearance of the individual bank’s equipment, customers\nare unaware of their victimization until their accounts have already been\ndepleted.b)The accused involvement in the criminal activity\nis pre-planned.To have become involved, the accused would have had to have\nmet with those higher up on the chain to be entrusted with the skimmer and pin\nhole camera, to have received instructions on its installation and instruction on\nmonitoring the ATM’s activity before re-attending to remove the device once the\ndata is recorded.The common pattern in these cases is to install the skimmer\ndevice and then monitor from a location nearby, the ATM’s use for a period of\ntime, before returning to collect the data and remove the device for future use.Consistent with that pattern, Mr. Sriranganathan was observed attending at the\nATM on three occasions, was seen loitering in the area of the ATM after the\ndevice was installed and had on him when arrested, a credit card, provided to\nhim to use to test the device.The accused did not spontaneously come upon his\ncriminal activity.c)Although the accused was not the mastermind of\nthe scheme or likely even an individual very high up in the organization, by\nagreeing to become involved, he was nevertheless knowingly joining in a criminal\nenterprise with others, was aware of the objective of the broader group and was\naware or should have been aware of the potential devastating effects of their\nactivities.He was in essence, knowingly, a member of a criminal organization.d)The prevalence of this type of crime is\nincreasing.This was a common theme of all of the cases I was referred to by\nboth the crown and the defence. In the Victim Impact Statement of Interac\nAssociation, the exponential growth of debit card fraud resulting from skimming\nis demonstrated in the increasing loss due to this activity.In 2003 the loss\nwas $44 million with 29,000 debit cards exploited.The loss has continued to\nincrease despite industry safeguards.In 2010 the loss due to skimming had grown\nto $119 million with over 205,000 debit cards exploited.e)Although in this case, the devices installed\nmalfunctioned and were seized by police before any loss could occur, the\npotential for loss was very significant - to those customers whose cards would\nhave been skimmed, to the bank specifically and to the integrity of the banking\nsystem in general.First\nthere is the primary victim, those whose cards have been skimmed.They will\nsuffer both the inconvenience of the fact their cards will not work and the\nembarrassment that their cards cannot be used to pay for goods and services.If their accounts have been accessed and funds taken, there will be a delay to\nreplace those funds while the bank conducts an investigation, during which the\ncardholders may be unable to meet basic living requirements, such as paying\ntheir rent or mortgage payments.Then\nthere is the secondary victim, the individual bank, which must investigate the\nloss and ultimately, reimburse the cardholder for the fraudulently obtained\nfunds.The\nfinal victim is the attack on the integrity of the banking system in general.f)The attack on the banking system is perhaps most\nimportant.The crime has a direct impact on the public’s faith in the security\nof the electronic banking system, a system which relies heavily on the\ncustomer’s use of ATMs.In R. v. Slade [2006] N.S.J. 445 (N.S.S.C.), Justice\nMacDonald of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court commented on this aspect:“In\nmy view, this type of offence goes right to the reliance the average member of\nthe public has in its electronic banking system.The ability of this type of\nactivity to throw havoc into our banking system is tremendous and dangerous.”It was\nalso commented on by Justice Van de Veen of the Alberta Provincial Court in R.\nv. Marano [2007] A.J. 425 at para. 16:“The\nnature of the offence before the Court is extremely serious.The scheme facilitated\nby the accused strikes at the very foundation of modern monetary technology\nheavily relied upon by the public at large to secure necessities of daily life\non an ongoing basis.”In R. v.\nSandranathan [2007] O.J. 2326, a case heard in this court by Wong, J., in a\nVictim Impact Statement provided by the bank, in that case the CIBC, as to the\nimpact of skimming and bank card fraud has on the banking system as a whole,\nthe bank had this to say:“This\nissue (card fraud) adds to a diminished belief in the structure and stability\nof the convenience card process.The lifeblood of any financial institution is\nits customer base, and if there is a lack of faith from clients in any of its\nsystems, including the convenience card sector, the economy as a whole is\neventually impacted.”[17]The key sentencing principles in this case\nare specific and general deterrence and rehabilitation.[18]The increasing prevalence of this type of\ncrime, its potential significant impact on the integrity of the banking system\nand its possible effects on the personal finances of individual bank customers demonstrates\na strong need for deterrence.[19]Although the accused was far more likely a\nfoot soldier as opposed to a general or even a captain in the scheme, the\nsuccess of any campaign is dependent on each of those individuals doing their\njob, all aware of the objectives of the whole.The accused though a lonely foot\nsoldier, was nevertheless involved and played his part in a pre-planned\norganized attack on the banking system and its customers, knowing the wrath\nthat such an attack could inflict.[20]Neither a conditional discharge nor a\nsuspended sentence would reflect the degree of deterrence, specific or general,\nthat is needed in this case.No cases have been referred to me where a\nconditional discharge for this type of offence has been granted.[21]That is also true for a suspended sentence,\nwith the exception of the co-accused in this case.This raises the issue of\nparity in that the accused does not appear to be in any different position as\nMr. Drepaul.He was granted a suspended sentence.It does appear that that\ncase was resolved before Marshall, J. in the absence of any sentencing authorities\nand without any input for the victim.This additional information greatly\nassisted the court in understanding the significant potential impact of this\ncriminal activity.In light of the review of that material, I am satisfied\nthat a suspended sentence is not an appropriate sentence in this case.Incarceration\nis the appropriate sentence for this offence.[22]The real issue for this court is whether the\noffence and the circumstances of the offender require the sentence be served in\njail or whether a conditional sentence is appropriate.[23]The period of incarceration appropriate in\nthis case is in the range applicable to conditional sentences.Further there\nis no evidence to suggest that the safety of the community would be endangered\nby the offender serving his sentence in the community, given that the accused\nhas no criminal record, has remained on bail since his release without breach\nand appears to have been engaged in the lower end of the criminal enterprise.In assessing the risk I considered both the likelihood of re-offence and the\ngravity of damage should the accused re-offend.Although the gravity could be\nsevere, the likelihood of re-offence is low.[24]Satisfaction of the pre-requisites to the\nimposition of a conditional sentence of course doesn’t end the matter.For a\nconditional sentence to be appropriate it must still be consistent with the\nsentencing principles set out under section 718 to 718.2 of the Criminal Code.[25]Denunciation, general and specific\ndeterrence and rehabilitation are all applicable principles of sentencing in\nthis case.The need for general deterrence is heightened given the increased prevalence\nof this type of crime and the significant and widespread potential for damage\nto the banking system.There is a compelling argument that a significant sentence\nof incarceration is warranted on grounds of general deterrence, to send a\nstrong clear message to those willing to risk exposure to be caught, all for\neasy gains, while those higher up in the enterprise remain hidden from the\nauthorities.[26]As regard specific deterrence, the accused\nappears to have entered an early guilty plea and expressed remorse.He has no\nrecord.A severe sentence is unlikely necessary to address specific deterrence.[27]Although both specific and general\ndeterrence are relevant sentencing principles, I am cognizant that rehabilitation\nis also of paramount consideration in a case where the accused is a youthful\nfirst offender.It is well established that when sentencing such an individual,\nthe paramount considerations are rehabilitation and specific deterrence and\nthat the court should be careful not to overemphasize general deterrence; see\nR. v. Stein (1974), 15 C.C.C. (2d) 376 (Ont. C.A.) and R. v. Priest (1996), 1996 CanLII 1381 (ON CA), 110\nC.C.C. (3d) 289 (Ont. C.A.).[28]As in all cases, but in this case\nparticularly, there are competing sentencing principles emphasizing the need\nfor a meaningful custodial sentence on one hand and others principles,\nmilitating away from sending a first offender to jail.[29]The aggravating factors point to a sentence\ngeared towards general deterrence and institutional incarceration.These\ninclude the significant potential for impact on the banking system by the type\nof criminal activity engaged in by the accused, including his loose but\nnevertheless association with others in what can fairly be characterized as a\ncriminal organization.There is also the increasing prevalence of this type of\ncrime which calls for the court to address general deterrence.Does the\npresence of these factors preclude the imposition of a conditional sentence?[30]R. v. Ijam 2007 ONCA 597 (CanLII), [2007] O.J. 3395 (Ont. C.A.) is a\nsentencing case which has some significant parallels with the case at bar.Both involve a youthful first offender.Neither involved an actual loss,\nalthough the potential for loss was great and thirdly, both involved an attack\non the integrity on the banking or monetary system.[31]In Ijam the accused had, along with his\nco-accused, set up a fairly sophisticated counterfeiting operation.They were\napprehended before the counterfeited money, some $8000, could be distributed.The\nissue before the Court of Appeal was whether a conditional sentence could be\nimpose in light of the aggravating factors which militated against the imposition\nof conditional sentence and towards a jail term to be served in an institution.[32]Sharpe, J. speaking for four of the five\nmember Court, stated at para 58:“….even when\nthere are aggravating factors which might point to the need for a sentence\ngeared to general deterrence, “a conditional sentence may provide sufficient denunciation\nand deterrence”, and it is an error “to rule out the possibility of a\nconditional sentence ab initio simply because aggravating features are\npresent.”: R. v. Proulx (2000), 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), 140 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (S.C.C.).”[33]In my view this is a close call, but I am\nprepared to find that in this case, that sufficient deterrence, specific and\ngeneral, can be fashioned in a conditional sentence, to be followed by a\nprobationary term largely to address the rehabilitative aspects of the sentence.[34]My sentence is therefore as follows:[35]You will be sentence to incarceration for a\nperiod of 4 months, to be served conditional in the community.[36]In addition to the mandatory terms, for the\nfirst three months of the Conditional Sentence Order you will remain confined\nin your residence except for the purpose of employment, personal medical\nappointments and religious services, for a single two hour continuous period\nweekly for the purpose of shopping for necessities and to comply with legal\nobligations regarding this Conditional Sentence Order.In the discretion of\nyour supervisor, these will be incorporated into a letter of permission to be\nout of your residence and the letter shall be carried on your person while\noutside your residence and provided to a police officer upon demand for\nidentification.You may obtain from the supervisor written permission to be\noutside your residence for any other reason deemed appropriate by the\nsupervisor and again, this permission shall be carried with you when outside\nyour residence and provided to police upon demand for identification.[37]For the last month of the custodial portion\nof your Conditional Sentence Order, you will be confined to your residence from\n10 pm to 6 am, 7 days a week.[38]You will perform 25 hours of community\nservice work at a rate of not less than 5 hours per month starting within 30\ndays of this Order, to be completed to be satisfaction of the supervisor and\ncompleted within 4 months.[39]You will reside at an address approved of by\nyour supervisor.[40]You will not associate with or have any\ncommunication with Marcus Drepaul.[41]In addition you are not to possess any\nfinancial instrument, including but not limited to any bank credit or debit\ncard, not in your own name.[42]Following the Conditional Sentence Order,\nyou will be placed on probation for 12 months on the following terms - reporting\nforthwith to your probation officer and thereafter as is required, keep the\npeace and be of good behaviour, reside at an address approved of by your\nprobation officer, not to possess any financial instrument, including but not\nlimited to any bank credit or debit card, not in your own name and have no\ncontact directly or indirectly with Marcus Drepaul.[43]At the request of the accused, the shopping\nperiod will be each and every Sunday from 10 a.m. to 12 noon, unless a\ndifferent two hour period is agreed upon by your supervisor.[44]The predicate offence will be the possession\nof the forgery device.The sentence on the other two offences will be\nconcurrent to each and concurrent to the predicate offence.The Victim\nSurcharge will be waived.[45]Any remaining charges, if any, on this\ninformation will be withdrawn at the request of the Crown.Released:February 29, 2012Signed: “Justice Robertson”"}

Daviau, forthe appellantJohn Patton, for the respondentHeard:June 29, 2010On appeal from the conviction entered byJustice J.M. Wilson of the Superior Court of Justice on April 6, 2005, andthe sentence imposed on June 28, 2005.MacFarland J.A.:[1]Following a trial by judge alone the appellant\nwas convicted on thirteen of seventeen charges, one of which was stayed\npursuant to the Kienapple principle.Counts 1 through 8 related to\nvarious assaults on K.M., the complainant.Counts 9 through 13 related to the\npossession of two handguns and ammunition.Count 14 related to a breach of\nrecognizance for possessing a weapon and counts 15 through 17 related to\npossession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking.[2]The appellant appeals both his conviction and\nsentence.Sentence Appeal[3]In relation to sentence, the appellant submits\nthat subsequent to his sentence in relation to the thirteen charges of which he\nwas convicted he was sentenced to a further period of incarceration for an\nunrelated offence. The sentence he received for that unrelated matter when\nadded to the sentence received for the matters before this court amount to a\npenitentiary sentence.Accordingly, because the total sentence exceeds a\nreformatory sentence, the probationary part of the sentence before us has\nbecome unlawful.The Crown concedes that the probation imposed by the trial\njudge, in light of the ensuing events, cannot stand.That part of the sentence\nwill accordingly be set aside.Conviction Appeal[4]The appellant raises two grounds of appeal.First, he argues that the trial judge erred in admitting into evidence the\ncomplainant’s prior inconsistent videotaped statement.Second, he argues\nineffective assistance of counsel.This latter ground of appeal relates to an\nAgreed Statement of Facts which was entered into evidence following the\nappellant’s testimony at trial.The Facts[5]The complainant’s grandmother contacted the\npolice on April 4, 2003.She was concerned for her granddaughter’s safety.The grandmother advised the police that a threat by the appellant included a\nthreat with a weapon.Given the allegation of a weapon, police took the threat\nseriously and police were placed to observe the grandmother’s residence and to\nintervene if necessary.[6]At 3:00 p.m. on April 4, 2003, Detective\nMacDonald and his partner attended at the grandmother’s home.They asked\ninitial questions of the complainant.Based on their observations both\nofficers concluded she had been assaulted.The police requested a videotaped\nstatement from both K.M. and her grandmother. They were both willing to provide\na statement and accompanied the police to the station.In her videotaped\nstatement, K.M. described six different assaults that the appellant allegedly\ncommitted on her, since 2002.The final incident involved the appellant\nputting a gun on her and forcing her to strip naked, take a shower, and serve\nhim drinks for an hour.After the incident was over, the complainant said she\nwrapped the gun in her pyjama bottoms and hid the gun in a shoe box amongst her\nclothes.[7]On April 4, 2003, shortly before midnight, the\nappellant was arrested in a high-risk take-down.A digital scale was found in\nhis jacket pocket and 9.97 grams of cocaine in a series of four baggies, was\nlocated on the passenger seat floor by the door.The police obtained a search\nwarrant to search the residence of the appellant’s parents for a weapon as\ndescribed by the complainant in her videotaped statement. The search warrant\nwas executed shortly after midnight on April 5, 2003.In the appellant’s\nbedroom the police located two handguns, ammunition and potential drug related\nitems, including an electronic scale, a grinder, various cutting agents and\nbaggies.They also seized what appeared to be two debt lists dated 2001 and\n2003.[8]At trial the complainant recanted the\nallegations outlined in the videotaped statement.She claimed that when she\ngave the statement she was angry at the appellant for his infidelity, high on\necstasy and had had little sleep in days. She had continued her relationship\nwith the appellant and had, one month before his conviction, given birth to his\nchild.After a voir dire, the trial judge admitted the statement into\nevidence for the truth of its contents.The complainant was also declared\nadverse.[9]The appellant testified and during his\nexamination-in-chief alleged a complex police initiated conspiracy in defence\nof the possession charge.Immediately thereafter, the Crown notified the court\nof its intention to investigate the appellant’s allegation and call reply\nevidence. Defence counsel did not re-examine the appellant after\ncross-examination.Rather than calling reply evidence defence counsel and the\nCrown agreed to file an Agreed Statement of Facts (ASF) which touched on four\nnarrow issues. The ASF clarified and corrected certain evidence which the\nappellant had given.[10]The trial judge convicted the appellant on four\nof the eight assault charges, of pointing a firearm and five other gun-related\ncharges and of breach of recognizance as the result of the gun convictions.He\nwas also convicted of possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking and\npossession of the proceeds of crime.The KGB Statement[11]First, the appellant argues that the trial judge improperly admitted the\ncomplainant’s KGB statement.His argument essentially is that the video\nrecording does not meet the requirements established by the Supreme Court of\nCanada in R. v. K.G.B., 1993 CanLII 116 (SCC), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 740.The criticisms include\nthat the camera was not close enough to the complainant, that there was no\nadditional close-up photo within the frame showing the complainant at close\nrange so that the trial judge could properly assess her demeanor, and that the faces\nof the interrogating officers were not shown.[12]In my view, this argument is entirely without merit.First and foremost,\nvideo recording has come a long way in the seventeen years since KGB.The subject video, played during the argument of the appeal, is clear and\nfocused.The complainant’s face is clearly visible at all times.While there was\nno second camera focused on the officers, their faces are clearly and\nadequately visible in profile.No complaint is made of the quality of the\naudio recording.[13]It is clear from her reasons that the trial judge had no difficulty with\nthe quality of the recording.Her reasons for judgment include the following\nobservations in relation to the video recording:[K.M.] recanted her videotaped statement.Her\nevidence at trial recanting the videotaped statement appeared flat, stilted and\nscripted. She simply denied any abuse and provided no explanation for her\nprevious statement that was credible.There were moments during the trial,\nduring her viva voce testimony where her evidence appeared to be true when she\nwas not being asked directly about the allegations and she was “off script”. By\nway of contrast, her videotaped statement was credible, natural in its delivery\nand made sense.It was understated.She did not exaggerate.…In my view, the two officers conducted a\nprofessional, sensitive interview. They asked questions, but were not directive\nor leading in how they pursued the videotaped interview.…The videotape confirms that [K.M.] is angry and upset\nby Mr. Curnew’s conduct – not surprisingly. However, the thrust of her evidence\nwas that the incident with the gun really, really frightened her.There is no indication in the videotape of any\nexaggeration of events, there is no indication of any jealousy in her\nevidence.If anything, she understates what happened. She is angry about him\narranging for her to go into debt. However, she realizes that by coming forward\nto the police, she will probably not see the money again.Defence also raises the issue of the allegation\nthat she had taken a narcotic, ecstasy, before providing the statement.I have\npreviously ruled upon this issue. I concluded that she had not taken a narcotic\nor, if she had, it did not affect the quality and reliability of her evidence.\nI repeat that conclusion here.I reject the suggestion that [K.M.] had taken\nanything that affected the reliability or truthfulness of her disclosure made\nto the police in her videotaped statement.[14]It is apparent from these comments as well as her ruling on the\nadmissibility of the statement, that the trial judge had no difficulty with the\nquality of the video recording or with her ability to observe the complainant’s\ndemeanor.In my view, the appellant’s interpretation of KGB is too\nnarrow.That case does not require that, to be admissible, the video recording\nmust be in the exact same format as the video recording was in that case.As\nLamer C.J. explained at p. 793-94: “a complete videotape record of the type\ndescribed above, or one which duplicates the experience of observing a\nwitness in the courtroom to the same extent, is another important indicium\nof reliability” (emphasis added).[15]The quality of the video recording was not raised as an issue at trial.The only issue raised at trial was voluntariness, where the defence argued that\nthe complainant had had little sleep in the hours preceding the making of her\nvideo statement and was high on ecstasy at the time.[16]In response to that argument, after reviewing the law relating to\noperating mind, the trial judge was satisfied that even if she accepted the\ncomplainant’s trial evidence in relation to the taking of the drug, any effects\nfrom her ingestion would have worn off in any event by the time she gave her\nstatement and the quality and reliability of her evidence was not affected. It\nwill be noted, however, that the trial judge did not accept the complainant’s\nevidence that she had taken drugs. Because it was not raised at trial, the\nquality of the video recording is not the subject of the trial judge’s ruling\non the admissibility of the statement.[17]However, in dealing with the voluntariness issue that was raised, there\nare findings made by the trial judge from which it may reasonably be inferred\nthat she had no difficulty with the quality of the video recording.By way of\nexample:The most telling evidence, in my view, of an\noperating mind is the contents of the videotape, itself.The answers given by [K.M.]\nto the questions asked were spontaneous and natural.She included gestures by\nway of explanation.The flow of her evidence was natural.She also\nexhibited a good memory for detail.Throughout her statement she was co-operative,\nquiet spoken and provided her evidence in a clear, comprehensive manner.I note that [K.M.] had no physical signs of any\nsort of impairment.[18]In conclusion, it is obvious from her ruling on the voir dire as\nwell as her reasons for judgment that the trial judge had no difficulty with\nthe quality of the video recording and she was able to observe the\ncomplainant’s demeanor in a meaningful way.[19]I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.Ineffective Assistance of Counsel[20]This ground of appeal concerns trial counsel’s agreement to file the\nAgreed Statement of Facts.The effect of that document was to undermine some\nof the evidence which the appellant had given at trial.He argues that the\nfiling of that statement made him out to be a liar in the trial judge’s eyes. He\nargues that had his credibility not been impugned in this way, he might have\nbeen believed and the result would have been different.[21]The appellant gave evidence at trial.In the course of giving that\nevidence he alleged a complex police initiated conspiracy in defence of the\npossession charge which included the alleged recycling of exhibits by the\npolice from an earlier trial at which the appellant had been acquitted.[22]There can be no question that the appellant was a difficult client who\nhad his own ideas about how the trial should be run.In giving his evidence,\nthe appellant’s answers implicated his trial counsel in the sense that he\nindicated that his allegations could be confirmed by his lawyer.Defence counsel\nwas put in a difficult position in attempting to balance his duty to represent\nhis client to the best of his ability and his duty as an officer of the court\nto ensure that the court is not misled.[23]Defence counsel did not re-examine his client after cross-examination\nwas complete.In my view, he cannot be criticized for his decision.Just to\ntake one example, the appellant alleged that the debt sheet, which had been\nmade an exhibit at trial and supported the charge of possession for the\npurpose, was the same document that had been made an exhibit at a trial before\nMatlow J. in 2003 where the appellant was acquitted for a similar charge.His\nevidence was that the police merely recycled that exhibit to support the\ncharges against him in 2005.Trial counsel in 2003 and 2005 was the same\nlawyer.In his evidence the appellant indicated that trial counsel could prove\nhis allegation.Trial counsel had compared the exhibits filed in 2003 and 2005\nand knew they were not the same.[24]The Crown indicated it would call reply evidence which would demonstrate\nthe falsity of this allegation.Trial counsel determined that the filing of\nthe Agreed Statement of Fact would be better than a string of witnesses who\nwould prove the falsity of the appellant’s evidence with devastating effect.[25]The appellant argues that the Agreed Statement was filed without his\nconsent and that trial counsel did not inform him nor give him the opportunity\nto participate in it.This was a tactical decision and one properly available\nto him as an officer of the court.[26]As Major J. noted in R. v. G.D.B., 2000 SCC 22 (CanLII), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 520, at para.\n34: “Where, in the course of a trial, counsel makes a decision in good faith\nand in the best interest of his client, a court should not look behind it save\nonly to prevent a miscarriage of justice.”[27]In G.D.B., Major J. noted:[27]Incompetence is determined by a\nreasonableness standard.The analysis proceeds upon a strong presumption that\ncounsel’s conduct fell within the wide range of reasonable professional\nassistance. The onus is on the appellant to establish the acts or omissions of\ncounsel that are alleged not to have been the result of reasonable professional\njudgment.The wisdom of hindsight has no place in this analysis.[28]Miscarriages of justice may take many forms\nin this context.In some instances, counsel’s performance may have resulted in\nprocedural unfairness. In others, the reliability of the trial’s result may\nhave been compromised.[29]In those cases where it is apparent that no\nprejudice has occurred, it will usually be undesirable for appellate courts to\nconsider the performance component of the analysis. The object of an\nineffectiveness claim is not to grade counsel’s performance or professional\nconduct. The latter is left to the profession’s self-governing body.If it is\nappropriate to dispose of an ineffectiveness claim on the ground of no\nprejudice having occurred, that is the course to follow (Strickland, supra,\nat p. 697).[28]This court must first consider whether the alleged incompetence resulted\nin a miscarriage of justice.In my view, there can be no doubt on this record that\nthere has been no miscarriage of justice.[29]The trial judge rejected the appellant’s evidence but in so doing did\nnot rely solely on the Agreed Statement of Facts.Her reasons for judgment\nmake it clear that she rejected the appellant’s evidence for many reasons and\nnot just on the basis of the Agreed Statement of Facts.[30]Starting at p. 21 of her reasons, she described the appellant as\nfollows:He was an arrogant, nonresponsive witness.He\nblamed the system for the false accusations and the conspiracy against him.He\nwas always the victim.He was volatile and angry in giving his answers,\nalthough he tried very hard to contain his reactions.His story and version of events often bordered on\nthe fantastical.It appeared that he just made things up as he went along.If\nthere ever was a plan, with his counsel being aware of the theory of the\ndefence, it appears that Mr. Curnew did not follow the plan.Andrew Curnew aggressively asserted facts and\nevents which were proved conclusively beyond a reasonable doubt in reply\nevidence not to bear any resemblance to the truth.When giving answers, Andrew Curnew was cagey.He\ntried to figure out what the question was and what its relevance was before\nproviding an answer.He had his own agenda.I do not accept his evidence. His\nmanner and attitude in testifying speak volumes, however, with respect to the\nnature of the relationship and the dynamic of control exerted by Andrew Curnew\nin his relationship with [K.M.]…Andrew Curnew was always right, and others are\nalways to blame. This quality was obvious from his testimony before the court\nas he spun an incredible web to try to explain away significantly incriminating\nevidence.According to him, he was the victim of an elaborate police\nconspiracy.The tape recording of the various telephone calls[1]\nconfirms that Andrew Curnew is always right and that others, including [Ms. M.],\n“fuck things up”.Andrew Curnew is an angry, explosive person. These\nqualities were obvious from both his testimony and, in particular, from three\nrecorded telephone calls.…Andrew Curnew acknowledged that he broke [Ms M.’s]\nnose. He was faced with the awkward observation of two police officers who\nconfirmed that on April 4th, 2003, that each of them observed the cut on [Ms.\nM.’s] nose and swelling around her eye.Andrew Curnew then fabricated some\nstory that he accidentally broke [Ms. M.’s] nose when she hit a snowbank while\ndriving a car.At one point he says he was asleep and his arm accidentally\nflung out and hit her nose.Later, he said it was a protective reaction\ntowards her in the context of an accident.I do not accept either\nexplanation.It is part of the elaborate web to cover the truth.I note, as\nwell, that [Ms. M.] simply denied that he broke her nose.She did not outline\nany accident theory in her evidence.…I do not accept the evidence of Andrew Curnew that\nhe accidentally hit [Ms. M.] on the nose when she drove into a snowbank. It\nbears no air of reality. At one time, he said it was an accident and it\noccurred while he was asleep; on another occasion, he said it was his reaction\nto protect her.I do not accept either explanation.…The suggestion by Andrew Curnew that the drugs were\nplanted by the police, or that they had previously seized from another person, a\nMr. Barry Curnew, not a relative, was fantastical.…The items located by the police in the accused’s\nbedroom were also evidence of trafficking.This included an electric scale,\nwhich had a white residue on its surface, according to Officer Eagleson. I\naccept the evidence. The scale was accurate to one-one hundredth of a gram.I\ndo not accept Mr. Curnew’s explanation that this scale was used in his courier\nbusiness.[31]It is apparent that the trial judge had many reasons for rejecting Mr.\nCurnew’s evidence apart from the Agreed Statement of Facts.In such\ncircumstances, the result of the trial would necessarily have been the same.\nThere is no miscarriage of justice and accordingly no need to review the\nconduct of defence counsel at trial.[32]I would give no effect to this ground of appeal.Conclusion[33]I would allow the sentence appeal and set aside the probation order.In\nall other respects I would dismiss the appeal.RELEASED:November 12, 2010“KF”“J.\nMacFarland J.A.”“I\nagree K.

Humphrey dated January 7, 1998.E N D O R S E M E N T[1]The appellant submits that the trial judge shifted the\nburden of proof in convicting the appellant.She relies, in particular,\non one sentence from the trial judge’s reasons:If Angie Codina is telling the truth,\nboth lawyers conspired to frame her by perjured evidence.[2]This sentence must be read in context.Later in\nhis reasons, the trial judge considered and properly applied W.(D.)[3]The appellant also submits that the trial judge was\noverly critical of the appellant’s evidence and was not similarly critical of\nthe evidence of the two key Crown witnesses.In our view, the approach\ntaken by the trial judge to the evidence of the appellant and to Crown\nwitnesses was both reasonable and understandable.We see no merit in this\nground of appeal.[4]The appellant contends that the trial judge erred in\nfinding that she concocted exhibit 48 in the absence of independent evidence of\nconcoction.In our view, the circumstances of this case are\ndistinguishable from those in R. v. Coutts and Middleton (1998), 1998 CanLII 4212 (ON CA), 126\nC.C.C. (3d) 545 at 551 (Ont.

As they walked down Dewdney Avenue, Mr. Strongquill and Mr. Kakakaway\nencountered a number of other young men. The group remained together for the\nevening, consuming alcohol.At about 3:00 a.m. they encountered two other\nyoung men who approached them. These two men were Stewart Whitebird and Darian\nMoise. Mr. Whitebird and Mr. Moise had also been drinking that evening.[4]One of the men in\nthe bigger group made the statement that “those guys rolled on me today”. Mr.\nStrongquill’s group then surrounded these two men and deployed bear mace. Both\nMr. Whitebird and Mr. Moise ran away. Mr. Whitebird was successful in evading the\ngroup, but Mr. Moise was chased by the group and cornered by Mr. Strongquill on\nthe steps of 1266 Robinson Street and stabbed once by Mr. Strongquill with a\nhunting knife.[5]Mr. Moise was\nleft to die and he remained on the steps for a number of hours before he was\ndiscovered by a group of young girls.THE ACCUSED[6]Mr. Strongquill\nis a 22 year old member of the Keeseekoose First Nation. He has a common law\nwife and a two year old daughter. Mr. Strongquill appears before the court on\nhis first criminal conviction.[7]Mr. Strongquill\nhad a chaotic childhood. He was one of 11 children born to Lawrence\nStrongquill, Sr. and Sheila Kakakaway. Mr. Strongquill and his siblings were\nfirst apprehended by the Ministry of Social Services May 29, 2002 due to\nparental neglect. This included problems with chronic parental addiction\nissues, domestic violence between the parents, violence perpetrated against the\naccused’s sisters by his mother, as well as no food in the home for lengthy\nperiods of time, no furniture or beds in the home and no toys for the children.\nAfter this initial apprehension, Mr. Strongquill was apprehended on a further\n14 occasions and placed in 7 different homes. By the time Mr. Strongquill was\n12 years old, he became a long term ward of the Ministry of Social Services.[8]Mr. Strongquill\ndescribed these placements as being in predominately white homes in white\ncommunities. He felt overt racism. Many of Mr. Strongquill’s family members,\nincluding his father, attended residential schools.[9]By age 16, Mr. Strongquill\nopted out of the Long Term Ward Program and tried unsuccessfully to rebuild a\nrelationship with his mother. Mr. Strongquill has established contact with his\nfather and now considers his father to be a pro social support.[10]Mr. Strongquill\nis not involved with any gangs. He states he rarely consumes alcohol, although\nhe was intoxicated at the time of this offence. He regularly uses marijuana.[11]Mr. Strongquill\nis completing his GED while in custody. He has had various jobs during his life\nand was employed full-time at ME Janitorial in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan at the\ntime of the offence. He had come to Regina for the weekend to visit.[12]Mr. Strongquill\nhas been assessed as being at a low risk to re-offend. He does not hold\npro-criminal attitudes or beliefs.[13]Two letters were\nfiled in support of Mr. Strongquill. The first is from Beverly Severeight who\ndescribed Mr. Strongquill as being a well-mannered, intelligent person who\nshowed respect and love towards her and to his family. The second letter is\nfrom Molly and Eugene Belanger, the grandparents of Mr. Strongquill’s common\nlaw partner. They described Mr. Strongquill as being compassionate,\nindependent, even tempered, motivated and hardworking.THE VICTIM[14]Darian Denzel\nMoisewas 16years old at the time of his death. Mr. Moise’s mother\npredeceased him and he was raised by his grandfather on the Ochapowace First\nNation. Mr. Moise’s cousin Erica described him as being a very kind, fun loving\nperson.Every greeting came with a hug, a bro shake and a big smile.[15]The victim impact\nstatements filed by Mr. Moise’s, auntie, Barbara Still and by his cousin Erica\nAllary reflect their grief at his loss. Ms. Still reflected on when she heard\nthe news and the heartbreak she felt when she saw and heard her dad crying after\nMr. Moise’s death. Ms. Still said there are no words to express the hurt and\nanger felt by her family. She has honored Mr. Moise’s memory by naming her\ninfant son after him.[16]Ms. Allary\ndescribed the hurt, anger and grief experienced by her family. She described\nthe loss they feel in never being able to see Mr. Moise graduate, in never\nseeing him in his first job, get married or have his first child. Ms. Allary\nhas organized a walk in north central Regina in memory of Mr. Moise. She will\ndo this for a total of four years.She said in her victim impact statement\nthat Mr. Moise would not want [them] to hold bad feelings nor ever seek\nrevenge. That is not how our grandmothers and grandfathers taught us”. She has\nchosen a positive way to remember Mr. Moise.CROWN AND DEFENCE JOINT SUBMISSION[17]The Crown and the\ndefence join in their submission to the court that a sentence of eight years\nminus the credit for the time spent on remand would be the appropriate sentence\nin these circumstances. Both counsel filed some cases for the court’s\nconsideration.ANALYSIS[18]In sentencing\noffenders, the court considers mitigating and aggravating factors. I find the\nfollowing to be mitigating factors:1.Mr. Strongquill has no previous criminal record. Mr.\nStrongquill has been in custody since September 29, 2015.This is a total of\n451 days actual custody or at 1.5 credit for each day in custody it would be\nequivalent to 676.5 days. He has been a contributing member of society, having\nheld a number of jobs. He was supporting his common law partner and child prior\nto his incarceration. He has expressed his remorse to the Moise family. I find\nthat to be a sincere expression of his position. I find that the accused\ndecided at an early date to accept responsibility for his actions. This is\nclear evidence of remorse. I find that he and his family have suffered\nfinancially as a result of his actions. The accused was under the influence of\nalcohol at the time of the offence. To be clear the voluntary consumption of\nalcohol by the accused is not a mitigating factor but it provides some\nexplanation for this senseless act of violence by someone with no previous\nrecord of violence towards someone who was a complete stranger to him.2.Mr.\nStrongquill is a First Nations man who has experienced a number of Gladue\nfactors (R v Gladue, 1999 CanLII 679 (SCC), [1999] 1 SCR 688). He experienced familial\nbreakdown and isolation. He grew up in extreme poverty. He was apprehended on\nmore than 14 occasions and was separated from his siblings, having been placed\nin white homes in white communities. He was subject to overt racism. He was\nsubjected to alcohol abuse and observed physical abuse in his home. He did not\nfeel loved and safe as a child.[19]I find the\nfollowing to be aggravating factors:Mr. Strongquill was part of a bigger group. Mr. Moise tried\nunsuccessfully to get away. Mr. Strongquill was a stranger to Mr. Moise. Mr.\nStrongquill was clearly armed with a knife, which made it too easy for him to\ninflict the fatal blow, cutting short the life of a young man with a lot of\nlife left to live.[20]In reviewing the\nprinciples of sentencing, all are relevant but some of the stated objectives\nappear to be more or less important than others in this case. Mr. Strongquill\nhas no previous criminal record and has been assessed at a low rate to\nre-offend. The pre-sentence report was very positive.[21]However, the\nsanction imposed here should denounce his unlawful conduct. It should deter\nother persons from committing like offences. It should provide reparation for\nharm done to the victims or to the community. It should promote a sense of\nresponsibility in offenders and an acknowledgment of the harm done to the\nvictim and to the community.[22]The next\nimportant principle for me to consider is that a sentence should be similar to\nsentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar\ncircumstances.[23]I have considered\na number of cases in assessing this principle. In R v Keepness,\n2010 SKCA 69 (CanLII), 359 Sask R 34, Jackson J.A. discussed at some length the concept\nof range of sentences, in particular for manslaughter. She said the following\nat para. 28:28In Saskatchewan, a review of the case law bears\nout the statement that there is a usual range for manslaughter, involving\nbrutality and alcohol or drugs, from four to 12 years. In Hathway, the\nsentencing judge, after a helpful review of the authorities, reached this same\nconclusion …[24]Justice Jackson\nthen quoted at length from the decision of Allbright J. in R v Hathway,\n2008 SKQB 480 (CanLII), 327 Sask R 129, including para. 36 from that decision which\nprovides as follows:36In considering the relevant decisions of the\nSaskatchewan Court of Appeal and various decisions of the Saskatchewan Court of\nQueen's Bench which have not been subject to appeal, I have concluded that the\nappropriate range of sentencing for the offence of manslaughter in the Province\nof Saskatchewan is between four years and 12 years. There are isolated\ninstances of sentences less than four years, and sentences greater than 12\nyears, however they are indeed exceptional, and in my view, a sentence falling\noutside of the range of four years to 12 years ought to occur only in the most\nunusual, exceptional or extenuating of circumstances. A distillation of the\nsentencing principles articulated in ss. 718, 718.1 and 718.2 of the Criminal\nCode, along with the circumstances of the offence and the circumstances of\nthe offender, will result in the vast majority of instances, in a sentence\nfalling within this range.[25]Justice Jackson\nindicated that she agreed with this general review of the law except for one\nthing. She held that it overstated “...the matter to conclude that departures\nfrom a range occur in the most unusual or exceptional circumstances only.” (para\n29)[26]A review of other\ncases from this jurisdiction involving convictions for manslaughter follow.[27]In R v\nLafontaine, 1997 SKCA (SentDig) 22, the Court of Appeal upheld a\nseven year sentence imposed on a 24 year old accused who fatally wounded his\nuncle with a shotgun while they struggled. The accused had no previous record,\nwas intoxicated and was confronting the victim about sexual abuse issues in the\nfamily.[28]In R v Key,\n2000 SKCA 127 (CanLII), 199 Sask R 239, the Court of Appeal increased a sentence for\nmanslaughter to seven years from four years. This was in addition to credit for\ntime in custody of about four years. The accused had a significant criminal\nrecord, containing over 40 previous offences. The court found that the stabbing\ndeath resulted from a common criminal enterprise planned well in advance and\nexpected to be violent. One person was beaten, one was stabbed to death, and\nanother had his door kicked down and his life threatened. This would have been\nequivalent to an 11 year sentence.[29]In R v Thorne,\n2000 SKCA 131 (CanLII), 199 Sask R 278, the Court of Appeal increased Ms. Thorne’s\nsentence to five years. She was involved in the same incident as Mr. Key, supra.\nShe had no previous criminal record, she did not participate in the actual\nstabbing and she had done well in custody. She was 18 years of age at the time\nand there was no pre-trial custody.[30]In R v Blind,\n2000 SKQB 536 (CanLII), 200 Sask R 14, I sentenced Mr. Blind to seven years imprisonment\nafter he entered a guilty plea to manslaughter. The accused had been involved\nin an argument in his home with others, ordered everyone to leave his house and\nas they were leaving, he fired a shot into their car which hit the victim, a\nteenage girl. The offence was out of character for the accused, he had been\ndrinking and he had a dated unrelated record.[31]In R v\nLittlewolfe, 2002 SKCA 143 (CanLII), 227 Sask R 245, two brothers beat the\nvictim using a four foot long wooden board as a weapon. Justice Tallis\nindicated in his judgment that “[t]he circumstances of this offence could\nhardly be more chilling.” (para. 3) Mr. Littlewolfe had no previous record and\nthe Court of Appeal reduced his sentence from 10 years to 8 years. The court\nnoted that the accused was responsive to programs made available to him while\non bail. Mr. Harper’s 10 year sentence was upheld as he was the older brother,\nwas the leader and had a previous record which included 23 previous convictions\nincluding an assault with a weapon.[32]In R v White,\n2002 SKQB 104 (CanLII), 216 Sask R 218, Barclay J. sentenced a 71 year old accused with\nno previous criminal record to nine years imprisonment for shooting his wife. The\naccused was intoxicated at the time of the offence.[33]In R v\nCampbell, 2005 SKCA (SentDig) 13, the Court of Appeal upheld a nine year\nsentence imposed on a 28 year old accused who stabbed his roommate twice,\ncausing his death while both were intoxicated. The accused called 9-1-1\nimmediately afterwards. Mr. Campbell had a previous record consisting of 35\nprevious convictions, including two threats and one assault.[34]A selection of\nsentencing decisions reviewed from other jurisdictions include the following:[35]In R v\nMcDougall, 2009 MBQB 299 (CanLII), 247 Man R (2d) 147, Associate Chief Justice Joyal\n(as he then was) imposed a sentence of three years on an aboriginal woman with\nno previous criminal record who killed her husband while under the influence of\nalcohol. The Crown sought a five year sentence and the accused sought a\nconditional sentence.[36]In R v McKay,\n2010 MBQB 56 (CanLII), 249 Man R (2d) 287,McKelvey J. imposed a sentence of seven\nyears. The accused was given two for one credit for his pre-trial custody\nresulting in a further term of two and one-half years in custody. The Crown had\nsought a sentence of 10 years and the accused sought a sentence of 6 years. The\nvictim died as a result of a single stab wound to the heart administered by the\naccused who was his cousin. Excessive consumption of alcohol was a factor.[37]In R v\nWoodcock, 2010 ONSC 3752 (CanLII), the accused, Woodcock and Barnett, were convicted\nof one count of manslaughter and four counts of aggravated assault. They had\nbeen in a shopping mall with a group of young men who were armed with loaded\nguns. They became involved in a gunfight with other men on the street which\nresulted in the death of a bystander and four other serious injuries. However,\nneither accused fired the shot that killed the deceased. The 4 years and 11\nweeks spent in pre-trial custody was credited on a two for one basis\n(translating to a credit of eight years and five months), which left a\nremaining term of three years and seven months imprisonment.[38]In R v Marini,\n2007 ONCA 858 (CanLII), the case involved an attempted robbery of a high-end jewelry\nstore. The Court of Appeal affirmed the global sentence of 10 years. The\naccused had no criminal record and the Crown had failed to prove beyond a\nreasonable doubt that the accused was the shooter. However, the offence\ninvolved considerable planning and the accused attempted to destroy evidence\nafter the offences.[39]In R v Dhanda,\n2005 BCCA 533 (CanLII), 218 BCAC 170, the accused killed the victim by firing a pump\naction shot gun two times at the victim’s face from close range. The jury\nrejected that the accused acted in self-defence but concluded he had been\nprovoked by the victim. There had been various confrontations in the past\nbetween the two men and on the night the victim was killed, the victim and two\nother people had come to the accused’s house to vandalize it. On appeal, the court\naffirmed the eight year sentence. The accused had a previous criminal record\ninvolving firearms.[40]As is evident\nfrom the cases referred to, there is a wide range of circumstances covered by a\nconviction for manslaughter. Justice Fraser, in R v. LaBerge, 1995 ABCA\n196 (CanLII), 165 AR 375 stated the following at para 6:6All unlawful act manslaughter cases have two common\nrequirements conduct which has caused the death of another; and fault short of\nintention to kill. However, despite these common elements, the offence of\nunlawful act manslaughter covers a wide range of cases extending from those\nwhich may be classified as near accident at the one extreme and near murder at\nthe other [citations omitted]. Different degrees of moral culpability attach to\neach along a continuum within that spectrum. It is precisely because a sentence\nfor manslaughter can range: from a suspended sentence up to life imprisonment\nthat the court must determine for sentencing purposes what rung on the moral\nculpability ladder the offender reached when he committed the prohibited act.\nThe purpose of this exercise is to ensure that the sentence imposed fits the\ndegree of moral fault of the offender for the harm done.[41]A similar comment\nwas made by McLachlin J., as she then was, in R v Creighton, 1993 CanLII 61 (SCC), [1993] 3\nSCR 3. Although referencing an older version of the manslaughter provision, her\npoint remains relevant: “[b]ecause manslaughter can occur in a wide variety of\ncircumstances, the penalties must be flexible....[t]he point is, the sentence\ncan be and is tailored to suit the degree of moral fault of the offender. (p.\n48)CONCLUSION[42]Not surprisingly,\nthere are no cases directly on point. However, it would appear that the joint\nsubmission is an appropriate one based on the circumstances of this case. The\nSaskatchewan Court of Appeal has consistently directed trial judges to accept\njoint submissions unless they are contrary to the public interest or contrary\nto the administration of justice. These principles have recently been affirmed\nby the Supreme Court of Canada (R v Anthony-Cook, 2016 SCC 43 (CanLII)).I do\nnot find the proposed sentence to offend the principles of justice and I am\nprepared to accept it.[43]I sentence Mr.\nStrongquill to 8 years with credit to be given for effectively 676.5 days in\ncustody. Accordingly the sentence will be 6 years 51 days on a go forward\nbasis.[44]Mr. Strongquill\nis prohibited from possessing any firearm, other than a prohibited firearm or\nrestricted firearm, and any cross-bow, restricted weapon, ammunition and\nexplosive substance during the period that begins on the day on which this\norder is made, and ends 10 years after his release from imprisonment; and any\nprohibited firearm, restricted firearm, prohibited weapon, prohibited device\nand prohibited ammunition for life.[45]Mr. Strongquill\nis required to surrender to a peace officer, a firearms officer or a chief\nfirearms officer anything the possession of which is prohibited by my order;\nand every authorization, license and registration certificate relating to\nanything the possession of which is prohibited by my order. He shall have 30\ndays in which to comply with this order.[46]Mr. Strongquill\nhas committed a primary designated offence within s. 487.04 of the Criminal\nCode. Pursuant to ss. 487.051(1) of the Criminal Code, I make an\norder in Form 5.03 authorizing the taking of the number of samples of bodily\nsubstances that is reasonably required for the purpose of forensic DNA\nanalysis.[47]I am required to\nimposed a victim fine surcharge. Given the circumstances I impose a victim fine\nsurcharge of $150.00 in default 30 days.The fine is payable forthwith and the\ndefault time is to be served concurrently with any other time being served.J.E.J.

Dennis Starr, appeals a sentence of seven\nyears which was imposed upon him by the trial judge after his second jury trial\non two charges of murder, which resulted in a single conviction for\nmanslaughter.2The circumstances leading to the imposition of the seven-year\nsentence are highly unusual.BACKGROUND\nFACTS TO THE OFFENCE3In the early morning hours of August 21, 1994, two individuals, Bernard Cook and Darlene Weselowski, were murdered on Provincial Road 247 on\nthe outskirts of metropolitan Winnipeg.4Weselowski was shot twice in the head with a 9mm handgun.Cook\nwas shot in the head four times and three more times in the abdomen with the\nsame handgun.5The accused was arrested and charged with two counts of first\ndegree murder on November 24, 1994.He was held in the Winnipeg Remand Centre\nwhile awaiting and during his trial.He was convicted on both counts of murder\nand was sentenced to life imprisonment on December 12, 1995.6The accused elected not to testify on his own behalf at his 1995\ntrial.The Crown built a case on the theory that the accused was the “hit man”\nresponsible for a gangland-style execution of Cook.The theory was the more\nreal because Cook was the “enforcer” with the Warriors, an aboriginal group of\nmen known to be involved in criminal activities.There was some bad blood\nbetween the Warriors and another group with whom the accused may have had some\nloose association.The theory of the Crown is that the victim Weselowski\nsimply happened to be present and therefore had to be eliminated.7There was evidence that Cook and Weselowski were at a bar which\nwas also frequented by the accused on the night of the executions.They all\nleft the bar at about the same time.They proceeded to the outskirts of Winnipeg\nin two vehicles, one of which was to be destroyed by Cook as part of an Autopac\nfraud.Cook busied himself driving that vehicle in a ditch in a manner which\nwould intentionally occasion damage.It was at this point that first\nWeselowski and then Cook were executed.8The evidence strongly suggested the presence of the accused at\nthe scene of the crime.There was a hint in the evidence that one or more\nother persons may have been involved.9The theory of the defence at the first trial was that other\npersons were responsible for the two murders.10The accused appealed his convictions to the Manitoba Court of\nAppeal.On February 13, 1998, the convictions were upheld by a majority\ndecision.Twaddle J.A., in dissent, would have ordered a new trial.The focus\nof the appeal was on two evidentiary issues and the adequacy of the charge to\nthe jury on the subject of reasonable doubt.11The accused appealed further to the Supreme Court of Canada.There was a hearing on December 3, 1998, and a second hearing on February 24,\n2000, and judgment was delivered on September 29, 2000.The majority ruled\nthat a new trial should be ordered.12The accused was returned to the Remand Centre, where he was held\npending his second trial.That second trial resulted in a single conviction\nfor manslaughter rather than murder, and the sentence of seven years was\nimposed on September 7, 2001.13From the time of his first conviction until the time that a new\ntrial was ordered by the Supreme Court of Canada, the accused was imprisoned at\nStony Mountain Institution (the Institution), and he again returned to that\ninstitution to serve the sentence imposed upon him by Keyser J.14When the accused was confined to the Institution after his first\ntrial, an intake assessment was developed, including the accused’s own version\nof the offence.This was recorded in early March of 1996.The accused\nvolunteered a statement, in which he admitted his involvement in the crime, but\ndenied primary responsibility.He stated that he had lured Cook to the\nisolated area on the pretext of an Autopac scam, under which Cook would be paid\n$500 for intentionally damaging a particular motor vehicle.The plan was to\nbreak Cook’s legs.Two other individuals were involved in the scheme,\nincluding the accused’s cousin, one Ray McCauley.When these two additional\nindividuals appeared at the scene, it was Ray McCauley who shot Weselowski, and\nthen Cook.15It seems self-evident that the statement influenced the jury’s\ndecision at the second trial, which was to convict for manslaughter and only\nwith respect to the death of Cook.16In the sentencing hearing, Keyser J. concluded that the\ncircumstances of the crime would normally call for a sentence of 15 years for\nthe manslaughter.Giving credit for the time spent in custody, both at the\nRemand Centre and at the Institution, she reduced the sentence to one of seven years,\ncommencing as of the date of the sentencing.17In crediting the accused with eight years, the trial judge gave\nhim credit for the time in the Remand Centre on a two-for-one basis, but no\nextra credit for the time served in the Institution.She calculated that he\nhad spent one year in remand and six years in the Institution, resulting in a\ncredit of eight years against what would normally be a 15‑year sentence.18Counsel agree that there was a miscalculation by the trial\njudge.The accused spent close to two years in the Remand Centre and five\nyears in the Institution, which would result in a credit of nine years rather\nthan eight.19On appeal, counsel for the accused argued that the trial judge\nrelied upon facts not established by the evidence as aggravating factors which\nwould normally justify a sentence of 15 years.I disagree.Moreover, this\npoint was not vigorously argued at the appeal hearing.The substantial\nchallenge to the fitness of the sentence was based upon an argument that the\naccused had been given insufficient credit for time served.20There is, of course, considerable jurisprudence justifying a\ntwo-for-one credit for the time spent in remand pending a trial.There have\nbeen cases where a three-for-one credit has been given, but these are the\nexception rather than the rule, and a two-for-one credit suggested by the trial\njudge in this case cannot be termed “unfit.”21The issue is whether the accused is entitled to a more generous\ncredit than one-for-one for the five years spent in the Institution.CIRCUMSTANCES OF\nIMPRISONMENT IN STONYMOUNTAIN INSTITUTION22The fundamental point of Mr. Brodsky’s submission is that the\naccused’s five years in the Institution were served in segregated confinement\nof one degree or another.A comparison is drawn to the time a prisoner spends\non remand.Since the accused was serving “hard time,” it is argued that his\ncredit for pre-sentence custody should be on a higher scale than one-for-one.23That the accused was held in segregation is not disputed.The\nCrown’s position is that after May 7, 1996, when his segregated status changed,\nhe could have been transferred to another institution where he would have been\npart of the general prison population had he taken appropriate steps to do so.24Counsel agreed that the evidence concerning his confinement had\nnot been presented to the trial judge, and they also agreed that this court\nshould have that information before deciding the merits of the appeal.Accordingly, Huband J.A. was commissioned to hear evidence presented by both\nthe Crown and the accused and to make a site visit and then report findings to\nthe panel.That report was submitted and made available to counsel on April 9, 2002, after which a further hearing took place before the panel on May 31, 2002.25I do not intend to review in detail the report of April 9th.26Initially, the accused was held in “D” range of the segregated\narea of the Institution.“D” range houses inmates which the Institution\nbelieves would jeopardize the security of the Institution if allowed to be\npresent in the general population.It is not surprising that the accused was\nso classified.At that time, and throughout his confinement at the\nInstitution, the accused stood as a man of violence who had executed two\npersons, one of them simply because she happened to be in the way.27In May of 1996, the accused’s security rating was changed to\nmedium security, entitling him to move to “E” range, with a somewhat greater\ndegree of freedom.For reasons which will be explained, the accused elected not\nto move to “E” range until March of 1997.“E” range houses prisoners whose\npresence in the general population would jeopardize the inmate’s own safety.28From March of 1997 onward, the accused was housed in “E” range\nexcept for two short-term transfers to “F” range, where, again, the degree of\nfreedom was slightly greater.29There is no doubt that the circumstances of confinement are\nfairly harsh for inmates who are segregated from the general prison\npopulation.“D” range is the most unpleasant.The prisoner in “D” range is\nconfined to his cell for all but one hour of exercise time (with limited\nexercise facilities) and time to take a shower.The cells are Spartan.There\nis a sliding steel door with an opening so that meals can be passed through it\nto the prisoner.All meals are taken in the cell.30Prisoners in the segregated ranges do not have the same degree of\naccess to rehabilitation programs as those in the general population, and the\naccused showed little or no interest in those programs which were available to\nhim.Educational upgrading was available, but the accused showed no interest.31The accused was reluctant to move to “E” range when his security\nrating was changed in the spring of 1996.The inmates on “E” range were there\nfor their own protection – sex offenders and those who testified against other\naccused persons, or inmates like the accused, who were perceived to be at risk\nfrom other inmates because of the nature of their crimes.Prison authorities\nconsidered the accused to be at risk from members of the Warriors gang because\nof his involvement in the execution of Cook, and those concerns were well\nfounded.32The move to “E” range gave the accused a greater degree of\nfreedom.He could exercise for up to two hours both morning and afternoon.There was a greater degree of social interchange.While meals were taken in\ntheir cells, the prisoners were allowed to leave their cells to obtain their\nmeals from a common area and return.33The accused accepted the opportunity to be employed during his\nincarceration, but the employment was of a menial nature.Segregated prisoners\ndo not have the same employment opportunities that are available to the general\npopulation, although the remuneration for what they do is the same.34Prisoners in segregated custody enjoy the same visiting\nprivileges as other inmates.There were times when visiting the accused was\nrestricted to “booth visits” or none at all.This was because the intended\nvisitor set off the machine that monitors illegal drugs or because of the\naccused’s own misconduct involving drugs within the Institution.Restrictions\non visiting were not long-lasting.35When the accused was reassessed as a medium-security risk in May\nof 1996, he became eligible for transfer to another medium-security institution,\nwhere he would not be in danger of revenge by members of the Warriors.A\ntransfer can be ordered by prison authorities, but in this case, the\nInstitution was not about to force a transfer against the accused’s wishes.Moreover, the general policy of the Institution was not to transfer a prisoner\nwhile there was an appeal pending or while there were outstanding charges\nagainst the accused.In this case, there were both.Concerning his appeal to\nthis court, there were hearings on September 10, 1997, and a continuation on\nNovember 10, 1997.It was totally unnecessary for the accused to be present at\nthose two hearings, but no formal waiver of his right to attend was provided to\nprison authorities.36Having lost the appeal, the accused appealed further to the\nSupreme Court of Canada.There were two hearings before that court and a\nfurther wait before the court rendered a decision ordering a new trial on September 29, 2000.It is obvious that the accused’s attendance at the Supreme Court was\nneither required nor desired.37The real reason the accused was not transferred to another\ninstitution was the outstanding charges, which remain outstanding even to this\ndate.The charges in question pre-dated the murder charges – possession of a\nprohibited weapon (The Pas) and possession of a dangerous weapon and pointing a\nfirearm (Amaranth).In the intake assessment when he was first admitted to the\nInstitution, the accused indicated that he planned to deal with these charges\nas soon as possible by pleading guilty with respect to one charge and not\nguilty with respect to the others.That of course did not occur.These\ncharges were on the docket in Provincial Court in Winnipeg from the time of his\nincarceration in the Institution forward.Presumably, they were adjourned from\ntime to time.There is no evidence that the accused was present in court for\nany of these remands.Indeed, there is positive evidence that he was not\npresent at any of the remands, 12 in number, between February 2, 1999, and his\ntransfer from the Institution to the Remand Centre in the fall of the year\n2000.38It is clear in retrospect that the accused was not needed, but\nthis was not made clear to the administration at the Institution.Mr. Brodsky\nprovided a letter to the Institution on behalf of his client dated May 15, 2000, which is ambiguous in its terms.The letter confirms that Mr. Brodsky\nappeared before Wyant P.J. on May 10th and that the matter was\nremanded to August 17th and that the accused’s appearance on that\ndate was waived.The last sentence of the letter states that a new date\n“likely in October will be fixed on August 17th for your next\nattendance.”39In spite of the ambiguity, prison authorities then became active\nin arranging a transfer for the accused, but the plan was not completed before\nthe decision of the Supreme Court was handed down.40Counsel for the accused says there were good reasons why the\noutstanding charges were not dealt with.Whether that is so or not, the fact\nremains that neither the Crown nor the accused were in any hurry to deal with\nthe matters, and in the meantime, it was known that they constituted a barrier\nto the transference of the accused to another institution.41It would appear that the accused could have been transferred to\nanother facility and become part of the general prison population had he and\nhis counsel seriously desired a transfer and then taken the necessary steps to\nfacilitate it.However, at the end of the day, I do not think it matters\ngreatly whether his non-transference was due to his own lack of initiative or\notherwise.The fact is he remained in segregated custody of one kind or\nanother for about five years.THE\nEXTENT OF THE CREDIT42There is jurisprudence to support the granting of a credit of\nmore than one-for-one for time spent on remand; see R. v. Wust, [2000]\n1 S.C.R. 455, 2000 SCC 18 (CanLII).There is no such jurisprudence with respect to\npre-sentence time served in the penitentiary as a sentenced prisoner.In my\nopinion, it would establish a dangerous precedent to enlarge the credit beyond\none-for-one in this case.43It is clear that being an inmate in segregation is distinctly\nunpleasant.That should come as no surprise since part of the function of the\nsentence is punitive.44It is also clear that there are different degrees of unpleasantness.There are maximum-, medium-, and minimum-security institutions, and the\nprisoner’s preference would doubtless be for the minimum-security institution\nif a choice was to be made.Within a medium-security institution such as the\nInstitution, it is obvious that some inmates have greater freedom of movement\nand greater access to programs and recreational activities than others.Low-risk inmates within the Institution may live relatively free from the usual\nrestraints at the prison farm.45The decision of who is assigned to what prison and at what level\nof security is for the prison administration, not for the courts.Yet, a\ndecision in this case to grant a more generous credit than one-for-one would\nmake it the business of the courts.I illustrate by putting the converse of\nthe accused’s situation.Suppose that the prison authorities, for whatever\nreason, decided that the accused was a candidate for the least restrictive form\nof custody.It surely would not be open to the Crown to argue that the accused\nshould receive less than a one-for-one credit by reason of the relatively\nbenign circumstances of his imprisonment.46In my view, a decision to grant a more generous credit than\none-for-one could and would impact on future sentencing decisions.It is often\nknown in advance, by the nature of the crime committed and the record of the\naccused, where the prisoner will likely be placed within the prison system,\njust as it was predictable in the present case that this accused would be\nconfined as a segregated inmate.Where such a prediction can reasonably be\nmade, should the courts take that into account in framing the sentence?Should\nthe serial rapist be sentenced more leniently because much of his prison time\nwill be as a segregated prisoner?Should a wheelchair-bound fraud artist, who\nposes no threat to any person and who is incapable of escape, be sentenced to a\nlonger prison term because of the certain knowledge that his confinement will\nbe under light security and with full privileges?I answer these rhetorical\nquestions with an emphatic “No.”Nor should the courts participate in a\nretroactive way, making these determinations as we are asked to do by the\naccused in the present case.47There are two areas where a parallel can be drawn with pre-sentence\ncustody spent on remand, and those relate to the determination of the date on\nwhich an inmate is eligible to apply for parole and, secondly, the date on\nwhich there is automatic remission of the sentence after two-thirds of it has\nbeen served.48Concerning eligibility to apply for parole, the accused argues\nthat had he received a 15-year sentence when he was first convicted in 1995, he\nwould be eligible to apply for parole today.The sentence imposed in September\nof 2001 automatically means that he is not eligible to apply for parole until\nat least a part of that sentence has run.However, eligibility to apply for\nparole is by no means a guarantee that parole would be granted.To accede to\nthe accused’s argument would be for the courts to assume responsibility for\neither granting or withholding parole.That is the function of those\nresponsible for administering the parole system, rather than the courts.49Concerning automatic remission, if the accused had been sentenced\nto 15 years after his first trial on December 12, 1995, he would likely have\nhad the benefit of automatic remission at the end of the year 2005.A sentence\nof six years imposed as of September 7, 2001, means that he would reach the\npoint where automatic remission would apply at approximately the same date.50As a consequence, considerations of parole are not a factor which\nshould alter the one-for-one credit.51I would allow the appeal only to the extent of providing a\ntwo-for-one credit for the time spent on remand, and I would therefore reduce\nthe sentence imposed, effective September 7, 2001, to one of six years’\nimprisonment.______________________________ J.A.I agree:______________________________ J.A.I agree:______________________________ J.A."}

March....................................................................................for\nthe accused Gene EnoRADLEY-WALTERS,J.:[1]This is a decision on the sentencing of the\naccused, aged fifty-five on a charge of refusing to provide a suitable sample\nof his breath for analysis contrary to section 254(5) of the Criminal Code of\nCanada.[2]The Crown chose to proceed by way of\nindictment on this charge.The accused selected trial in the Ontario Court of\nJustice.I found the accused guilty of this offence, by virtue of my written\ndecision released on January the 26th, 2007.[3]The Crown has asked for a sentence of four\nyears on this charge.The Crown has also sought a lifetime prohibition on Mr.\nEno’s driving privileges.[4]Defence counsel has conceded that\nimprisonment is appropriate, but that the sentence should be two years.[5]The facts of this particular case are set\nout in my written decision released January the 26th, 2007.[6]When this matter appeared before me, on\nMarch 5th, 2007, I was provided with Mr. Eno’s Criminal Record and\nhis record under the Highway Traffic Act.Both counsel have acknowledged that\nMr. Eno’s Criminal Record can only be described as horrendous for drinking and\ndriving offences as well as convictions for driving while disqualified.In summary,\nMr. Eno has been convicted on fifteen previous occasions for either impaired\ndriving, driving while over .08 or refusing to blow.Mr. Eno has been\nconvicted on seven previous occasions with driving while disqualified.Mr. Eno\nhas been convicted of dangerous driving under the Criminal Code on one occasion\nand failing to remain at the scene of an accident under the Criminal Code on\none occasion.Mr. Eno has a total of thirty-seven previous Criminal Code\nconvictions.Twenty-four of those charges are related to driving.It is acknowledged\nthat Mr. Eno was served with a notice of increased penalty pursuant to the Criminal\nCode.Defence counsel has provided me with submissions as to Mr. Eno’s\npersonal background.Mr. Eno is currently fifty-five years old and single.He\nis a carpenter and a member of a Carpenters’ Union.Mr. Eno is Aboriginal and\nhas status with the Algonquin tribe of Pikwakanagan, located at Golden Lake.Mr. Eno, is one of ten children, who was raised in an alcoholic\nfamily.Mr. Eno is an admitted alcoholic.Defence counsel have drawn the\ncourt's attention to the fact that prior to the conviction registered by me on\nJanuary 26, 2007 that Mr. Eno had not been convicted of any Criminal Code\nmatters since February 16th, 1995 which is a period of almost\nexactly twelve years.In addition, his longest previous sentence of incarceration\nwas seven and a half months.Mr. Eno has no crimes for injuring or killing\nanyone.[7]As indicated above, counsel drew to my\nattention the fact that Mr. Gene Eno had Aboriginal status.I raised the issue\nthat an inquiry must be made pursuant to the decision of R. v. Kakekagamick,\n2006 CanLII 28549 (ON CA), 211 C.C.C. (3d) 289, in accordance with s. 718.2(e) of the Criminal Code.Counsel for Mr. Eno indicated on the record that he was specifically waiving\nMr. Eno’s rights under the Gladue decision in this particular case.[8]The maximum sentence of imprisonment for Mr.\nEno, pursuant to section 255(1) (b) of the Criminal Code of Canada is five\nyears imprisonment.Section 259 (1) (c) of the Criminal Code of Canada\nmandates that I prohibit Mr. Eno from driving no less than three years plus any\nof the time that Mr. Eno is sentenced to imprisonment. There is no upper limit\non the driving prohibition.[9]I have read with interest the decision of my\nbrother, Justice Kukurin, in the case of R. v. Noel, 2005 ONCJ 492 (CanLII).Justice Kukurin has set out a detailed analysis of the law with respect to\nsentencing offenders with multiple prior drinking and driving convictions.I\nadopt his reasons for decision in this case.[10]I agree with Justice Kukurin that the themes\nthat pervade the decisions on sentencing in drinking and driving cases are as\nfollows:“1) Deterrence and denunciation are key\nobjectives;2)Imprisonment is almost invariable for third or\nsubsequent offences;3)For offenders with multiple, that is approaching\nten, drinking/driving related offences, with poor evidence of addressing the\ndrinking problem, sentences exceed two years;4)Sentences for offences arising out of the same\ntransaction or incident need not be concurrent, but may be consecutive particularly\nwhere different public interests are tied to the offences;5)Convictions for additional offences may result\nin additional imprisonment subject to the totality principle;6)Appellate courts appear to be harsh in their\nattitude towards sentencing when the offender has reached a point where s/he\nhasn’t learned despite many chances, and the odds on rehabilitation are poor;7)The courts are sensitive to the public demand\nfor intolerance by our justice system to drinking/driving behaviour and to the\nimportance of the public's perception of and approval of sentencing practices.”[11]In the present case, I would have no\ndifficulty in according to the Crown's submissions for a four year penitentiary\nterm for Mr. Eno, if his conviction had taken place on or about 1996.Mr.\nEno's case, then it would have fit within the principles set out in the Ontario\nCourt of Appeal’s decisions which are referred to in the case of R. v. Noel,\nsupra.The challenge for me in the present case is to balance those decisions\nwith the principle of proportionality, the gap principle, and the step\nprinciple.[12]The evidence before me at Mr. Eno's trial\nwas to the effect that Mr. Eno was stopped in a RIDE program.It is true that\nhe rolled through the RIDE program and the officers had to yell at him to stop,\nwhich he did.Mr. Eno refused to blow into the Approved Screening device,\nbecause he had knowledge that he had consumed alcohol, which was in\ncontravention of his G1 license.The police officers, I find, treated Mr. Eno\nfairly and appropriately.They charged Mr. Eno with refusing to provide a\nsuitable sample of his breath for analysis into an Approved Screening Device\nand released him immediately on his undertaking to appear.The police officers\ndid not charge Mr. Eno with impaired driving, because they did not feel that\nthere were reasonable and probable grounds to charge him with this offence.There was no evidence of bad driving by Mr. Eno.[13]On the issue of rehabilitation, I must take\ninto consideration the fact that Mr. Eno had no Criminal Code convictions\nbetween 1995 and January of 2007.Although Mr. Eno is an admitted alcoholic,\nand clearly was drinking and driving on December 18th, 2005, Mr. Eno\nwas successful in rehabilitating himself to the extent that he had no\nconvictions during this twelve year period.[14]I am mindful of the fact that Mr. Eno has\nbeen sentenced in the past to reformatory terms of imprisonment.One sentence\nwas six months in duration, and another was seven and a half months.[15]In the present case, I acknowledge that\nthere is no way short of imprisonment to achieve the objectives of denunciation\nand deterrence with respect to Mr. Eno.I am, however, persuaded by the\nsubmissions of counsel for Mr. Eno that a two-year sentence is appropriate in\nall of the circumstances.I am advised that Mr. Eno has spent 120 days in Pre-sentence\ncustody and I will give him credit on a two-for-one basis for that time in\njail, which is equivalent to 240 days or eight months in prison.Under the\ncircumstances, I am imposing a sentence of 16 months in jail for Mr. Eno.In\naddition, I am prohibiting Mr. Eno from driving anywhere in Canada for the rest of his life.I am\nwaiving the victim fine surcharge with respect to this matter.Released:March 8th, 2007________________________________________The\nHonourable Mr. Justice G. Radley-Walters"}

Gauthier, [1996] B.C.J. No. 1469 (QL), 108\nC.C.C. (3d 231 (C.A.)).[3]Monkman was identified by independent witnesses\nat the scene as the person who actually stabbed Ming Hong Huynh (“Huynh”) four times.Counsel for Monkman, in his address to\nthe jury, conceded as much and asked for a manslaughter conviction only.The jury,\nhowever, found the killing to be intentional.Aside from independent witnesses\nat the scene, the crown’s main witness was Danny Simao (“Simao”), the cousin of\nTavares.For many reasons that I outlined in the charge to the jury, I\ncautioned that it would be dangerous to rely on Simao’s evidence without\nconfirmation in some way, but that the jury was free to accept some, all or\nnone of it if it so chose.[4]Because of the convictions for manslaughter of\nTavares and Ponce on which I will comment later in greater detail, the jury\nmust have relied on at least some of Simao’s testimony, most notably the\nconversation in the car that Simao said took place on the way from the\nFreehouse lounge to Club Desire.Simao said that both Tavares and Ponce were\nsaying, “We’re going to fix you up” or words to that effect.Monkman had a\nknife in the back seat that he showed to Simao and then said, “I’m going to\njuck him” or similar words, which Simao took to mean “stab”.Within a very\nshort time after arriving at Club Desire, Monkman was seen by several witnesses\nin possession of a knife and having inflicted four stab wounds to Huynh.[5]Simao testified that before the group left the\nFreehouse a phone call had been received by Tavares to the effect that,\n“Buddy’s at the rave.”Although Simao conceded that “rave” was his term and\nnot used by anyone else, he said he was told that this was the person who had\nstabbed his cousin some time before.Medical records (ex. 25) showed that\nTavares had in fact received a stab wound the previous month, although he\nprovided an innocent explanation for the wound to medical personnel.The\ndefence argued that no connection had been made between Huynh and any of the\naccused, but a reasonable inference may be drawn that Huynh either was the person\nwho had stabbed Tavares or at least was believed by the three accused to be the\nperson who had inflicted the wound.[6]This inference is bolstered by the observations\nof some of the witnesses at the scene. Michael Embury testified that Monkman\nwas laughing as he got back in the SUV.Anthony Raposo, working security at\nClub Desire, did not hear any laughing, but described Monkman as cheering\nhimself on and saying “I fucking got him.”James Wakefield testified that\nMonkman was performing a celebratory touchdown dance before he got into the\nSUV.This demeanour closely mirrors the evidence of Simao that, when Monkman\nreturned to the car after the stabbing, he said, “I fucking got him.”[7]In my view, therefore, the jury put weight on\nSimao’s testimony as to the conversation in the SUV.Although the jury was not\nsatisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the killing of Huynh was both planned\nand deliberate so as to make it first degree murder, the evidence the jury must\nhave accepted was that there was at least some indicia of planning before the\nconfrontation.[8]For Tavares and Ponce to be found guilty of\nmanslaughter, the jury first had to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that\nthey knew Monkman intended to cause bodily harm, but did not know it was likely\nto cause death, even though death ensued.Both had the same opportunity to\nobserve and hear from the front seat what was transpiring in the back seat, and\nthe same information was available to them.The jury, in my view, had to rely\non Simao regarding the comments made by Tavares and Ponce in the car, the\ncomments of Monkman about “jucking” someone and knowledge of the knife by both\nTavares and Ponce in order to find that they knew Monkman intended to cause\nbodily harm to someone at Club Desire.[9]The jury further had to find that, with that\nknowledge, Tavares and Ponce either aided and/or abetted Monkman.I am\nsatisfied that the jury relied on the words spoken by Tavares and Ponce in the\nSUV on the way to Club Desire.These comments must have been considered by the\njury to be words of encouragement to Monkman to cause the bodily harm and that,\nby so doing, they intended those words to be encouraging of Monkman’s actions.Their words were uttered with the intention that Monkman be encouraged to cause\nbodily harm.When Huynh died as a result of Monkman’s actions and the\nencouragement of Tavares and Ponce, they were guilty of manslaughter as\nabettors.[10]In addition to that, I am satisfied beyond a\nreasonable doubt that Tavares drove the vehicle to Club Desire with the\nintention of aiding Monkman to cause bodily harm.Simao testified that Tavares\nwas the driver of the vehicle.No one other than Simao identified Tavares as\nbeing at Club Desire at all.However, the four of them left the Freehouse only\nminutes before the confrontation, as verified by the video at the Freehouse.Also, a witness at the scene phoned 911 with a licence plate of the suspect SUV\nbeing FLO 159.This plate did not exist, but when substituted with commonly\nmistaken letters, plate ELD 159 came up.This was a 2006 Lincoln Navigator,\nrented April 26, 2006, by Andrea Melnyk and John Dacamera.Tavares was present\nwhen the vehicle was rented.It was found some days later in a chop shop in\nSelkirk, with Monkman’s blood in the back seat.There is no doubt that this\nwas the vehicle in which all the accused and Simao drove to Club Desire and\nfled after the stabbing.[11]I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that\nTavares knew Monkman intended to cause bodily harm to someone at Club Desire\nand that he drove him to and away from the scene with the intention of\nassisting Monkman.This is particularly so when the words of encouragement to\nMonkman by Tavares have apparently been accepted by the jury.[12]The Crown contended that Ponce was also guilty\nof aiding Monkman.Their position was that Ponce acted as a distraction to\nHuynh so as to enable Monkman to sneak up on him and inflict the fatal blows.Simao’s evidence as to what Ponce did at the scene was unreliable and\ncontradicted by all the independent witnesses.Simao described a confrontation\nbetween Tavares and Ponce on the one hand, and Huynh on the other hand, on the\nsteps of Club Desire.The confrontation did not occur on the steps – there was\nno blood found there at all.Huynh had cocaine and marijuana in his system and\nan extremely high blood alcohol content of .31.His shirt was off, as was\nusual for him when he wanted to fight, according to his girlfriend Angela\nPfeiffer.None of the independent witnesses saw any physical contact between\nPonce and Huynh.Jared Lehotsky, who could not identify Ponce, said Huynh and\na smaller man were facing each other with their hands down and fists clenched.Michael Laurin agreed there was no physical contact between the two men and\nthat Ponce was not taking an aggressive stance.Anthony Raposo testified that Huynh and the smaller\nman were angry and facing each other. He was going to intervene when a man he\nidentified as Monkman told him to back off.He confirmed that the smaller man\nwas retreating, and Huynh was advancing aggressively.[13]Jeanine Brouillette\ninitially noticed a smaller guy on the corner motioning for Huynh to come on.This was not mentioned in her statement to police and, on cross-examination,\nshe admitted she could not recall if he made gestures.She confirmed that the\nsmaller Asian guy never took one step toward Huynh and never threw a punch at\nhim.On direct, she commented that he appeared to be leading Huynh.Again,\nthat term was not used in her conversations with the police.Dee Dee Griffiths\ndescribed Huynh and the smaller guy as yelling at and goading each other.I\ndid not find Dee Dee Griffiths to be a reliable witness.She was\nconfrontational with defence counsel and seemed to be enjoying a verbal joust\nwith them rather than trying to actually say what she saw.Heather Mousley\nused the term “circling” to describe the motions made by the smaller man and\nHuynh.Shayne Lewis said both were “jawing,” but that there was no contact.Finally, James Wakefield said he saw two Asians circling, but no blows were\nexchanged.[14]I am not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt\nthat Ponce acted deliberately to distract Huynh as opposed to having been\ncaught up in Huynh’s aggression that evening.Huynh had been aggressive and\nconfrontational with other people before the fatal encounter with Monkman.There was also no evidence from Simao or anyone else that any conversation had\ntaken place about Ponce trying to act as a distraction to assist Monkman to\nsneak up on Huynh.In the absence of that, I am not prepared to find that the\nactions of Ponce at the scene were only consistent with aiding Monkman.[15]Therefore, I am satisfied, on the evidence the\njury had to accept and the evidence I find to be proven, that Tavares was\nguilty of manslaughter by both aiding and abetting Monkman in his actions and\nthat Ponce was guilty of manslaughter only by abetting Monkman.Monkman[16]Because Monkman was convicted of second degree\nmurder, the automatic sentence is one of life imprisonment.The Crown has\nrecommended that there be no eligibility for parole before 15 years, whereas\ndefence counsel has requested the minimum statutory term of life with no parole\nfor 10 years.The jury declined to make a recommendation when asked if they\nwished to do so.The victim impact statement supplied by Huynh’s sister is\nheartrending and sets out the loss that his family feels as a consequence of\nhis death.His sister described how their parents left Vietnam during wartime\nand escaped with only the clothes on their backs in order to give their\nchildren a better life.She talked about how her brother Ming would never have\nthe opportunity now to get married and have a family or to be an uncle to her\nchildren.And she described the emotional and physical toll his death had\ncaused her personally.It is important never to forget the profound effect the\nloss of a family member to violence causes to those left behind.[17]The criminal record of\nMonkman was filed as Exhibit S2 during sentencing submissions.It reflects\nthat he has twice been incarcerated in a federal penitentiary, once in 1991 for\nproperty offences and once in 1997 for robberies.There is violence on his\nrecord and, at the time of the commission of this murder, he was on probation\nfor an offence involving domestic violence.[18]Monkman is of aboriginal background, but counsel\nadvised that no Gladue report was being\nrequested.I was told that Monkman does not appear to have suffered from any\nof the classic systemic disadvantages of many people with his background.His\nparents were both professionals who raised their children to be good citizens.Of nine siblings, he is the only one who has ever been in trouble with the\nlaw.He candidly described himself as the black sheep of the family.[19]As defence counsel pointed out, Monkman will\nreceive a sentence of life imprisonment for his conviction.Even with the\nminimum period of 10 years to serve before being eligible for parole, there is\nno guarantee that he will in fact be granted parole after 10 years without\nshowing that he is ready to be put back into society.Nonetheless, the Code\nsets out the ability of a sentencing judge to raise the eligibility period\nto up to 25 years.The closer the offence is to first degree murder or the\nmore aggravating the circumstances of the murder, the more likely that the\nminimum period will be raised.[20]I accept that Monkman is genuinely remorseful\nfor having taken Huynh’s life.However, there are\naggravating elements present in this case.These involve:(i)a certain amount of planning or deliberation in\nhis actions;(ii)use of a knife to inflict four wounds to Huynh, three of which were potentially lethal;(iii)attacking Huynh when the latter was extremely\nintoxicated and not expecting the assault by Monkman;(iv)his jubilant reaction after having inflicted\nthe wounds to Huynh;(v)his prior criminal record for violence; and(vi)the fact that he was on probation for violence\nat the time of the commission of this offence.[21]Given the criminal antecedents of Monkman,\nparticularly for violence, and the elements of planning that are present in\nthis case, I am of the view that the appropriate disposition for Monkman is one\nof life imprisonment with no parole for a period of 12 years.Tavares[22]Tavares comes before the court as an individual\nwith a criminal record as well.It was filed as Exhibit S3 during sentencing\nsubmissions.Tavares received a sentence of 32 months in November 2002 for\ncharges of assault, assault with a weapon, uttering threats and failure to\ncomply. Then, two months later, he received four years consecutive for\npossession of crack cocaine for the purpose of trafficking.The first set of\nconvictions was related to disturbing actions of violently confronting people\nwho had outstanding drug debts.Tavares acted as “muscle” to enforce those\ndebts, and both threatened and assaulted several individuals.The disturbing\nparticulars of those circumstances no doubt explain the significant\npenitentiary sentence handed out to a person with no prior criminal record.Despite having been sentenced to an effective sentence of more than six and\none-half years after the second conviction, he received day parole in July\n2004.Tavares had been on day parole for 21 months at the time of this\ninvolvement.[23]The Crown has requested a sentence of ten years,\nless credit for some of the time he has been in custody.Tavares was arrested\nin May 2007, and his parole was revoked.His original sentence lapsed in\nFebruary 2009, at which point he was transferred to the Winnipeg Remand\nCentre.The Crown has submitted that Tavares receive 1.5 to one credit for\ntime served from February 24, 2009, to the date of sentencing, for an\napproximate credit of 18 months, but that he should receive no credit for time\nserved between his arrest in 2007 and February 2009.Defence counsel has\nrequested a sentence of three to five years, less time served.They are\nrequesting credit of one for one from May 2007 to February 2009 and two for one\nafter, which would equate to a period of 45 months’ credit for time served.[24]The Crown provided no case law to support the\nposition that Tavares should receive ten years’ incarceration for his\ninvolvement.Defence counsel filed several cases, none of which are\nparticularly on point with the facts of this case.There are few precedents\nfor people who are convicted as abettors and/or aiders rather than for having\npersonally inflicted the fatal blows.That makes sentencing for manslaughter,\nalready one of the most difficult crimes for which to sentence, even more so.In R. v. Hermiz, [2007] O.J. No. 1589\n(QL) (S.C.J.)), Hill J. of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice made\nreference to a number of appellate decisions that had commented on the broad\nrange of sentences available for manslaughter.These include:-R. v. Clarke, 2003 CanLII 28199 (ON CA), [2003] O.J. No. 1966 (QL) (Ont.\nC.A.) at ¶7:“The range of sentence for the offence of manslaughter can vary\nimmensely.”-R. v. C.C., 2003 MBCA 51 (CanLII) at ¶7:“The\nsentencing options available to a sentencing court for this offence are like no\nother.”-R. v. Dasilva, [1988] B.C.J. No. 1744 (QL)\n(C.A.) at ¶2:“It is clear enough that sentences for manslaughter vary from a\nsuspended sentence to sentences of life imprisonment.”-R. v. E.H., 2005 BCCA 3 (CanLII), [2005] B.C.J. No. 4 (QL), 192\nC.C.C. (3d) 366 (C.A.), at ¶20:“... the well-established spectrum of\nculpability in manslaughter cases ranging from ‘near accident’ to ‘near\nmurder’...”.[25]In R. v. Henry, 2002 NSCA 33\n(CanLii) (CanLII) at ¶19, Roscoe J.A., writing for the court, said that, “a significant\ndistinguishing factor between cases where a low or non-penitentiary term is\nappropriate and those where a lengthy sentence is imposed for manslaughter is\nthe moral blameworthiness or fault of the offender.”There is a lot of\ndiscretionary room between the two extremes of the spectrum.[26]Section 718 of the Criminal Code\nsets out the following purpose and principles of sentencing:718. The fundamental purpose of sentencing is to contribute, along with\ncrime prevention initiatives, to respect for the law and the maintenance of a\njust, peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions that have one or\nmore of the following objectives:(a)to denounce unlawful conduct;(b)to deter the offender and other persons from committing offences;(c)to separate offenders from society, where necessary;(d)to assist in rehabilitating offenders;(e)to provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the\ncommunity; and(f)to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and\nacknowledgment of the harm done to victims and to the community.[27]Tavares is 30 years of age and has a grade 11\neducation.He has an 11-year-old daughter and a mother battling cancer.Defence counsel tried to propose that Tavares was simply in the wrong place at\nthe wrong time and that there was no plan to hurt Huynh.However, this is not\nconsistent with the findings of the jury.[28]There is little to be said in mitigation for\nTavares, other than his relative youth and personal circumstances.Although he\ndid not personally attack Huynh, he has been found to\nhave both encouraged and assisted Monkman in the killing.There are a number\nof aggravating factors for Tavares:(i)his assistance and encouragement of Mr. Monkman\ncontributed significantly to the violence that befell Huynh;(ii)the assistance and encouragement were not impulsive, spontaneous acts, but in fact took some time;(iii)Tavares has a recent criminal record for\nserious violence; and(iv)he was on parole for those violent offences at\nthe time of the commission of this offence.Thus, in my view,\nTavares has a high degree of moral culpability for the death of Huynh.He is disentitled to leniency as a result of all those\nfactors.[29]Tavares will be sentenced to seven years for\nthis manslaughter.He will receive no credit for the time between May 2007 and\nFebruary 2009, as that period is attributable to time remaining on his original\ndrug and assault charges once parole was revoked.From February 2009 on, he\nwould not be disentitled to credit for roughly two for one.I am giving him\ncredit for two years’ time already served.Therefore, the effective sentence\nfrom today’s date will be one of five years’ incarceration.Ponce[30]Ponce comes before the court for sentencing with\nno criminal record whatsoever.I found that he was guilty of encouraging\nMonkman, but not assisting him at the scene.In the case of Ponce,\nrehabilitation is more important than with respect to Monkman or Tavares.I\nwas advised that Ponce had spent 11 months in pre-trial detention.Similarly,\nhe has been in custody since the jury rendered its verdict, and he will receive\ncredit for two years of time served.The Crown and defence are in agreement\nthat two for one credit for time served is appropriate under the\ncircumstances.The Crown has requested that he receive seven years, less time\nserved, while defence has suggested three years less time served.[31]There are more mitigating factors available in\nthe case of Ponce:(i)he is relatively young and in a stable\nrelationship of 11 years with two children, nine and three, and a wife in a\nprofessional faculty at the University of Manitoba;(ii)after spending 11 months in pre-trial\ndetention, he received judicial interim release and spent a lengthy time out on\nstrict bail conditions with no breaches;(iii)he has strong community support;(iv)he was the least involved of all the accused;\nand(v)he has no prior criminal record.Ponce has good\nprospects for rehabilitation.Nonetheless, he was involved in encouraging\nMonkman to harm Huynh, which resulted in Huynh’s\ndeath.This was not a spontaneous act, but one with a certain amount of\nplanning.Thus, although he was less involved than Monkman or Tavares, his\nmoral culpability remains relatively high.[32]In my view, the appropriate sentence for Ponce\nis four years’ incarceration less time served, for an effective sentence as of\ntoday of two years.[33]Lastly, the following orders will be made with\nrespect to all accused:(i)weapons prohibition orders pursuant to s.\n109(2)(a) of the Code for 10 years and s. 109(2)(b) for life;(ii)s. 487.051 order pursuant to the Code\nfor the taking of such samples of bodily substances as may be required for the\npurpose of forensic DNA analysis; and(iii)no victim impact surcharges will be imposed\ngiven the periods of imprisonment that have been imposed.J."}

They were that the firearm was used in the commission of the\noffence of attempted murder as contained in count number one of the indictment.[4]Upon arraignment the accused entered pleas of guilty, Counsel on behalf\nof the accused spoke to sentence and the matter was adjourned until today for\nthe imposition of sentence. I do not propose to review in detail the facts\nwhich were agreed to and put before the court by counsel.[5]The accused on May eighteenth, 1982, accompanied by one Agecoutay,\nrobbed a Safeway Store at Confederation Park in the City of Saskatoon;\nAgecoutay using a revolver and the accused a knife.[6]They left the store with some ten thousand dollars in cash and took the\nAssistant Manager David Cheke as hostage. They also commandeered Mr. Cheke's\ncar and a chase throughout various parts of the City followed during which\nshots were fired at a pursuing police car by Agecoutay. Mr. Cheke's car was\ndemolished and a police car was commandeered in its place. They finally entered\nthe Huskey House on Idylwyld Square in the City, still using Cheke as a\nhostage, where a woman and two police officers were also taken hostage. Some\nhours later the accused voluntarily surrendered and Agecoutay also surrendered\nsome time later and the hostages were unharmed.[7]On September twenty-first, 1982, following pleas of guilty to four\ncharges, the accused was sentenced to a total term of eight years imprisonment\nin a Federal Penitentiary. The charges and the sentences imposed were as\nfollows: Count number one, armed robbery, six years. Count number two,\nkidnapping the Assistant Manager Cheke, six years concurrent to count number\none. Count number three, unlawful confinement of one Marina Patricia Sweeney,\ntwo years consecutive to count number one. And count number four, the unlawful\nconfinement of Gary Lund, a police officer, the sentence was two years\nconcurrent to count number one.[8]Other facts that must be taken into consideration before imposing\nsentence include the record of the accused and the sentence imposed on his\naccomplice Agecoutay on the same charges. And finally there is a question of\nlaw which was argued on Monday with respect to count number two, namely the\neffect of the Chapter of Rights and Freedoms on the state of the law as\nit existed prior to its proclamation.[9]Dealing first with the facts, the record of the accused is extensive. He\nis now only twenty-three years of age, will be twenty-four in less than two\nmonths, and he has been in almost continuous trouble with the law since he\nceased to be a juvenile in 1975. Prior to that he was institutionalized from\nthe age of eleven, spending most of his life from age seven when his mother\ndied in foster homes. On some thirty convictions since he became an adult,\nmainly for breaking and entering, theft and possession of stolen property, he\nhas had custodial sentences imposed on him that range from fourteen days to two\nyears. As his Counsel points out, almost all his adult life has been spent in\nprison. He has taken advantage of programs available in prison and has managed\nto obtain his grade twelve education.[10]While it was not referred to in detail, Agecoutay apparently had a far\nmore serious record of previous conviction than this accused with a number\ninvolving the use of offensive weapons. Following the hostage taking Agecoutay\npleaded guilty to seven charges that included armed robbery, kidnapping,\nattempted murder, three counts of unlawful confinement and one count of using a\nfirearm while committing an indictable offence. He was sentenced to a total of\neighteen years imprisonment. To the same counts to which Morin has pleaded\nguilty before this court, Agecoutay was sentenced to eighteen years for\nattempted murder and two years consecutive on the charge of using a firearm\nwhile committing an indictable offence.[11]I believe this to be a sufficient review of the facts and I have, I turn\nnow to the question of law that was argued before the court on Monday.[12]It relates to count number two and as I mentioned previously the effect\nif any of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms on the interpretation of s.\n83(1) (a) of the Criminal Code.[13]Section 83.(1)(a), that is the provisions that are relevant to this\ncharge, reads as follows:\"Every one who uses a firearm(a) while committing or attempting to commit an indictable\noffence, …\" \"… whether or not he causes or means to cause bodily harm\nto any person as a result thereof, is guilty of an indictable offence and is\nliable to imprisonment.(c) in the case of a first offence under this\nsubsection,…\" \"… for not more than fourteen years and not less than\none year;\"Subsection two provides:A sentence imposed on a person for an offence under subsec.\n(1) shall be served consecutively to any other punishment imposed on him for an\noffence arising out of the same event or series of events and to any other\nsentence to which he is subject at the time the sentence is imposed on him for\nan offence under subsec. (1).[14]This section was proclaimed in force January first, 1978. Its\ninterpretation has been considered by a number of the courts of this country\nculminating in the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in McGuigan v.\nThe Queen (1982), 1982 CanLII 41 (SCC), 40 N.R. 499; 66 C.C.C.(2d) 97. Therein the majority of\nthe Supreme Court of Canada, five out of seven of the presiding judges,\nconcluded that, in enacting the section, it was the clear intention of\nParliament to depart from the principle, the fundamental principle that an\naccused should not be punished twice for the same matter. Dickson, J.A.,\nspeaking on behalf of the majority of the court said at page 124.\"In my view, Parliament has in the enactment of s. 83\ndeparted from the fundamental common law principle of the criminal law that nemo\ndebet bis puniri pro uno delicto, elaborated in Kienapple, and has shown\nthat the use of a firearm in the commission of the offence of robbery shall\nalso constitute a separate and distinct offence under s. 83 for which a\nseparate and additional …\" \"… punishment shall be imposed.\"He went on:… When Parliament turned its attention to s. 83 it is obvious\nfrom the language used that Parliament was concerned with 'use', not innocent\npossession, and concerned with 'firearms', not knives or toy pistols.\nParliament clearly contemplated that when in the course of a robbery a firearm\nis used, multiple prosecutions and multiple convictions would follow and would\nsupplant the common law principle expressed in Kienapple and in Cox\nand Paton v. The Queen,…He concluded:If Parliament had intended to exclude from the meaning of the\nwords 'an indictable offence' in s. 83(l)(a) any criminal offence an essential\nelement of which is the having of a firearm, it could have made its meaning\nclear through apt words, or it could have simply re-enacted the former s. 122,\nwhich had been judicially interpreted restrictively, as the new s. 83.\nParliament did neither.[15]In dissent Laskin, the Chief Justice, Ritchie concurring, concluded in\nthe MoGuigan case that where the involvement of a firearm is the\nessential element of the offence, and in that case robbery, and the\ncircumstances show that the accused used the weapon, it would be the height of\ntechnicality or formalism to say that the accused is also rendered liable to\nconviction under s. 83(1) simply because the use of a firearm is not an\nessential element of the offence of robbery.[16]The minority said in effect that the statement of an offence in the\nterms of the Criminal Code cannot be disassociated from the\ncircumstances affecting the accused or his conduct so as to expose him to an\nadditional liability for that conduct unless the additional liability is\nclearly assigned. This was the state of the law as of April seventeenth, 1982,\nand I am of course bound by the majority decision of the Supreme Court.[17]On April eighteenth, 1982, the Charter of Rights and Freedoms was\nproclaimed and became part of the law of Canada. The section we are concerned\nwith is s. 11 and the relevant portions read as follows:11. Any person charged with an offence has the right(h) … if finally found guilty and punished for the offence,\nnot to be tried or punished for it again;[18]The question is whether the introduction of the Charter alters\nthe interpretation that was given to s. 83 or affects it in any way.[19]With the assistance of Counsel, I am satisfied that there is only one\nreported decision on the question and it deals with the specific point. While I\ndo not have the full reasons for judgment, I was able to locate a more detailed\nreport of the decision in (1983), 2, Charter of Rights Decisions, 725.250.02.\nThe name of the case is R. v. Krug.[20]The accused in that case attempted to recover an automobile which had\nbeen seized by a finance company. He went to the office of the towing company\nthat had seized the car taking a rifle with him after stating he would shoot\nanyone that got in his way. He knocked at the door and when an employee\nresponded, he pointed the rifle and ordered the employee to open the door. The\npolice arrived and found the rifle with one shell in the chamber and three more\nin the clip. The accused was charged with attempted robbery, possession of a\nfirearm for purpose dangerous to the public, pointing a firearm, and the same\noffence with which this accused stands charged; the use of a firearm while\ncommitting an indictable offence contrary to s. 83.[21]Vannini, County Court Judge, dismissed the charge of possession of a\nfirearm for a purpose dangerous to the public on the ground that the purpose of\nthe possession was to commit the robbery and the principles of Kienapple foreclosed\na finding of guilt on that charge when there was a finding of guilt on the\ncharge of attempted robbery. But in addition to committing the accused of\nattempted robbery, His Honour Judge Vannini also found the accused guilty of\npointing a firearm and the offence under s. 83. His comments with respect to\nthe Charter as found in the report available to me are as follows:Because s. 11(h) of the Charter is expressly and\nspecifically referrable to 'the offence' of which a person has been acquitted\nor for which a person has been found guilty and punished, it applies only if\nthe offences involved are identical in that they contain the same elements and\nconstitute one and the same offence arising out of the same set of\ncircumstances. Because the offence of using a firearm in the commission of an\noffence of attempting to steal while armed therewith constitutes a separate and\ndistinct offence under s. 83(1)(a) for which a separate and additional\npunishment shall be imposed by a term of imprisonment and does not have the\nsame elements and does not constitute one and the same offence as the offence\nof attempting to steal while armed therewith of which the accused has been\nfound guilty, s. 11(h) of the Charter does not preclude a finding of\nguilt being made for the offence under s. 83(1)(a) and an additional punishment\nbeing imposed in respect thereof.[22]With this finding I am in agreement. The argument that the lack of an\nessential element is not sufficient to warrant conviction for a second offence\nwas rejected by the Supreme Court of Canada, that is the majority of the court,\nin R. v. McGuigan and in my view the specific wording of the Charter does\nnot have the effect of altering the law as it existed prior to April\neighteenth, 1982, with respect to s. 83.[23]Applying the findings to the present case, the shooting of the firearm\nby Agecoutay is only one element of the offence of attempted murder. There are\na number of other elements that are required to establish that offence and\naccordingly conviction under s. 83 is not precluded by the Charter.[24]I turn now to the record of the sentences previously imposed which I\nhave and also to the judgment of my Brother Wimmer in September, 1982. I am\nsatisfied that Mr. Justice Wimmer considered all the facts and circumstances\nthat led to the charge of attempted murder even though that charge is not\nspecifically before him. He had available to him the record of the accused and\nthe punishment imposed on Agecoutay for the same offences. It is not my\nintention to add to the maximum punishment that Mr. Justice Wimmer imposed. I\nwill also take into consideration the time served from September, 1982, to this\ndate as the trial on these charges could not proceed because of the court\ncalender and not through any fault of the accused.[25]Would you stand up, please Mr. Morin. On count number one, the charge of\nattempted murder, you will be sentenced to a term of imprisonment in the\nFederal Penitentiary of seven and one half years, such sentence to run\nconcurrent to any sentence you are presently serving. On count number two, the\ncharge of using a firearm while committing an indictable offence, you will be\nsentenced to a term of one year imprisonment and that sentence shall be served\nconsecutively to any other punishment imposed on you for an offence arising out\nof the same events or series of events and to any other sentence to which you\nare subject as of this date.[26]There will be a further order that I am required to make even though one\nis already in place and that is that you will be prohibited from having in your\npossession any firearm, ammunition, or explosive substance for a period of five\nyears from the date of your release from incarceration.[27]Is there anything further you wish to say, Mr. Morin?MR. MORIN: No.THE COURT: All right, Gentlemen, that will be the sentence\nimposed on the two charges.Order accordingly."}

Tomlinson, for the DefenceDefendant))))HEARD:October12, 2016REASONS FOR SENTENCEBielby J.Overview[1]On July 27, 2016, I convicted the offender,\nFaith Chinwendu Uzondu, of, on June 9, 2015, having heroin in her possession\nfor the purpose of trafficking, contrary to the Controlled Drugs and\nSubstances Act. Three other charges were dismissed.[2]A sentencing hearing was conducted on October\n12, 2016.The Facts[3]In June, 2015, a package was intercepted by\nCanada Border Services and was found to contain 486 grams of heroin. The\npackage was made up of a number of wooden dowels which were covered by bangles.\nThe heroin was inserted into the dowels.[4]The RCMP was notified and a controlled delivery\nwas organized. On its face, the package was to be delivered to a Samuel John.\nIt was to be delivered by TNT Delivery.[5]On July 8, 2015 the offender called TNT and said\nshe was the wife of Samuel John and provided her home address for the delivery\nof the package. The package was delivered to the address on July 9, 2015. The\noffender was not home so as pre-arranged by the offender, a second floor tenant\nsigned for the package and left it on the stairs leading down to the offender’s\napartment.[6]Shortly thereafter the offender returned home\nand discovered the package. She then called a person by the name of Dan who had\narranged for her participation in the delivery of the package. She was advised\nby Dan that someone else would attend at her home and take possession of the\npackage.[7]The offender hid the package behind the furnace.\nSubsequently the police exercised a warrant and entered the premises. The\npackage was located and the offender arrested.[8]The offender was to be paid $700 for her role.[9]The expert report of RCMP Officer Corcoran was\nadmitted on consent and therein the officer opined that the amount seized was possessed\nfor the purpose of trafficking. This opinion was not challenged.Circumstances of the Offender[10]The offender has been in custody since July 9, 2015. She has resided\nin Canada since 2011, entering the country from Nigeria on a student visa. She\nleft two children in Nigeria in the care of her mother who was financing the\noffender’s trip to Canada for the purposes of a higher education.[11]The offender studied for one year at Durham College in Oshawa but\nthen dropped out of school. The offender’s visa expired in 2012 which resulted\nin the offender making a refugee claim. She remained in Oshawa for a while but\nsoon relocated in Toronto to live with her boyfriend.[12]The offender got involved in fraudulent internet schemes which\ninvolved wire transfers and the collection of cheques. Her activities also\ninvolved the use and transfer of fraudulent credit cards and passports.[13]In 2014, the offender was introduced to Dan and continued, with him,\nto participate in fraudulent activities. She would collect monies obtained\nthrough fraud and deposit the funds in accounts in her name. She would then\nwithdraw the monies and pay them to Dan.[14]The offender testified that a portion of the monies she earned was\nsent back to Nigeria to help support her children. Counsel for the offender\nargues that the offender, shortly after her arrival in Canada, was vulnerable\nand was taken advantage of by other individuals who used her for their illegal\npurposes.[15]While this may be true to some extent, from the text messages\nreceived and the offender’s testimony the offender seemed to be a willing\nparticipant.[16]In her pre-sentence report the offender denies responsibility and\nknowledge of the heroin. It is suggested therein that she is remorseful for the\ncriminality in which she voluntarily participated.[17]In her statement to the police the offender was very misleading,\nhowever, defense counsel submits that the lies did not cause the police to\nconduct a useless investigation and ultimately the offender told the police\nabout Dan.[18]Further, it is submitted that when the offender was in actual\npossession of the package there was only a very small amount of heroin\ncontained therein as most of it had been removed by the police. The amount left\nin the package was about 5.5 grams.Impact on the Victim and/or Community[19]The impact of illegal drugs on the community needs no real\nexplanation.It continues to tear at the social fabric of our nation. The cost\nof the damage done is horrendous. The costs are both in money and lives.[20]Heroin is one of the hardest of drugs and one of the most addictive.\nGenerally, for sentencing purposes the possession of heroin results in longer\nsentences than those imposed with respect to the other types of controlled\nsubstances.[21]From the judgement of the Court of Appeal, in R. v. Pannu\n2015 ONCA 677 (CanLII), para. 184, and in reference to the trial judge, I quote, “He\nalso pointed out the highly addictive nature of the heroin, its promotion of\nother crimes to sustain it users’ habits and its ruination of lives and\nfamilies.”Legal Parameters[22]Section 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act\nprovides for a maximum sentence of life imprisonment for the possession of a\ncontrolled substance for the purpose of trafficking. The possibility of life\nimprisonment is an indication of the very serious nature of the offence for\nwhich the offender was convicted.Positions of Crown and Defence[23]The Crown seeks a sentence of five years. The Crown submits that the\nrange of sentencing for a first offender in possession of .5 to 1 kilogram of\nheroin is six to 12 years. The Crown also requests the offender be ordered to\nprovide a DNA sample which request was unopposed by defence counsel.[24]The Crown submits that there is nothing exceptional or extenuating\nand while the circumstances are regrettable, a crime was committed.[25]The offender was a low level participant in the movement of heroin\nand often such participation arises out of unfortunate circumstances.[26]The Crown submits that the aggravating factors include the type of\ndrug, and the amount of the drug. The offender was motivated by profit, also an\naggravating factor.[27]The Crown agrees that the offender should get credit for time served\nat the rate of 1.5 days for every day in custody pending sentence.[28]Defence counsel submits that the appropriate global sentence would\nbe two years less one day. He submits the offender has been in custody since\nJuly 9, 2015 and should get a credit of 1.5 days for each day in pre-trial\ncustody, resulting in a sentence of time served.[29]Defence counsel submits that his client should be subject to a three\nyear probation order.[30]As noted, defence counsel takes no issue with the request for a DNA\norder.Case Law[31]As referenced previously, R. v. Pannu, is a decision of the\nOntario Court of Appeal. The trial judge had imposed, on each of the accused, a\nsentence of nine years for the possession of a kilogram of heroin for the\npurpose of trafficking. Neither accused had a criminal record. Both accused\nappealed the length of their sentence. The appeal was dismissed.[32]The trial judge opined that the range of sentence was between six\nyears and 12 years, for first time offenders.[33]From paragraph 192 of the Court of Appeal’s ruling I quote,“Second,\nthe sentences imposed are within the range of sentence the appellants\nthemselves concede is appropriate for first offenders convicted of possession\nof heroin for the purpose of trafficking. The sentences sit at the mid-point of\nthe range the appellants says is apt, although some authority suggests that the\nappropriate range is nine to 12 years for similar amounts of heroin: R. v.\nShahnawaz (2000) 2000 CanLII 16973 (ON CA), 149 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 6.”[34]The Appeal Court went on to say, at paragraph 193,“But they\nwere also found in possession of a substantial amount of a highly addictive\ndrug. It is a reasonable inference that their possession was for financial\ngain. Nothing more. Nothing less. For those so inclined, the price upon\nconviction must be steep.”[35]R. v. Kelsy [2008] O. J. No. 3879 is a\ndecision of G. Trotter J., as he then was, of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice.\nThe accused was convicted of a number of gun charges as well as possession of\n34.42 grams of heroin for the purpose of trafficking. The accused was 24 at the\ntime the crimes were committed and had no criminal record.[36]The court found that the gun charges were an aggravating factor in\nconsidering the sentence for the possession charge. The court also took into\naccount the almost five years the accused was under strict terms of bail pending\ntrial. Further, during that time the accused had educated herself, and put\nherself in a better position to care for herself and her child.[37]The accused was sentenced to jail for two years less a day.[38]Counsel for the offender referenced two other authorities; R. v.\nChan 2003 CarswellOnt 3115 (ONCA) and R. v. Giammarco 2012\nCarswellOnt 2917.[39]In the Chan case the RCMP intercepted a package containing six\nkilos of heroin. All was removed except for one gram and a controlled delivery\nwas executed. At trial the accused, who was found to be in possession for the\npurpose of trafficking, was sentenced to ten years in jail. It was argued on\nappeal that when the appellant took possession of the package it only contained\nthe one gram and that such a small amount is not sufficient to convict for the\npurpose of trafficking.[40]The Court of Appeal rejected that argument stating at paragraph 27,\nthat the quantity of the drugs possessed is not part of the actus reus\nof the offence.Regardless of the amount, if the intent of the possession is\nto traffic, then the offence is made out.[41]In Chan the appellant argued that the trial judge erred in\nprinciple in imposing a sentence of ten years imprisonment. In regards to the\nactual amount of heroin in the package (one gram) when the appellant was found\nin possession the Court said, at paragraph 74,“It is\nclear that, but for the intervention of the authorities, the appellant would\nhave succeeded in his efforts to obtain possession of a much larger quantity of\nheroin than that which he actually received. Because of the appellant’s efforts\nwere frustrated only as a result of that intervention, I see no reason for\nreducing his sentence in any significant way from that which would have been\nimposed had the appellant succeeded.”[42]The Giammarco decision is that of Hourigan J., as he then was,\nof the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. This case also dealt with the RCMP\ninterception of package containing an amount of heroin and the execution of a\ncontrolled delivery. The two accused were sentenced to five and six years in\njail.[43]In Giammarco it was argued by defence counsel that while\ntheir clients had no knowledge of the specific type of controlled substance in\nthe package,the trial judge ruled that such wilful blindness is not a mitigating\nfactor as the accused did not take any reasonable steps to understand the\nnature of the substance.Mitigating and Aggravating Factors[44]Ms. Uzondu readily admitted to her involvement in ongoing fraudulent\nschemes. She was paid by Dan to do whatever he requested, including taking\ndelivery and having possession for the purpose of trafficking, a package\ncontaining a quantity of heroin. I find her participation in the fraudulent\nactivities to be an aggravating factor.[45]The type of drug seized, heroin, given its addictive qualities and its\nimpact on society, is an aggravating factor.[46]The planned circumstances of the offence I accept as an aggravating\nfactor as well as the motivation for profit.[47]Notwithstanding her admission of fraudulent activity the offender,\nit would appear, does not have a criminal record which is a mitigating factor,\nto some degree, notwithstanding that when arrested for this offence the\noffender was on bail in regards to a charge(s) relating to fraud. She will be\ntreated as a first time offender.[48]She was gainfully employed at the time of the offence and sent money\nhome to support her two children. I accept those factors as mitigating in\nnature.Principles of Sentencing[49]Section 718 of the Criminal Code of Canada sets out the\npurpose of sentencing and lists the objectives to be considered by the\nsentencing judge.[50]As noted in the Kelsy case, paragraph 35, the objectives to\nbe emphasized in cases such as this, are denunciation and deterrence, both\ngeneral and specific.Reasons and Decision[51]The offender, Faith Chinwendu Uzondu, had in her possession, for a\nshort period of time, heroin and for sentencing purposes the amount of heroin\nto be taken into account is almost half a kilo.[52]The possession was planned and deliberate and the offender was one\nperson out of many, to participate in the scheme of trafficking in heroin. She\nwas paid for her participation, which was akin to a drug mule.[53]The nature of the offender’s role puts her at the low end of the\nheroin trafficking hierarchy. She was a conduit, used to insulate others from\npossibly arrest.[54]I accept the submissions of the Crown that the case law suggests the\nappropriate range of sentence to be six to 12 years but accept the submission\nthat given the amount of heroin involved was less than half a kilo, the\nsentence should be at the lower end of that range or even below.[55]As noted by Trotter J. in Kelsy, other authorities suggest a\nvery wide range and in Kelsy the accused was sentenced to two years less\none day.Counsel for the offender relies on this case in support of what he\nbelieves to be the appropriate global sentence.[56]With respect, I disagree with defense counsel. Given aggravating\nfactors as determined by me, a longer sentence is appropriate.[57]Taking all of the circumstances into account I believe a global\nsentence of four years is required but is subject to a credit for time served.[58]In regards to a credit, I will grant it at a rate of 1.5 for every\nday of custody up to the date of sentencing. The offender has been in custody\nsince July 9, 2015, which, to the date of sentencing amounts to 502 days.\nAccordingly, the offender is to get credit for 753 days in custody.[59]I therefore sentence the offender to a further 22 months in jail.[60]The offender is ordered to provide a DNA sample.___________________________Bielby\nJ.Released:November\n23, 2016CITATION:\nR. v.

No. 6178The Issues[1]There are two issues for me to decide.Firstly, should Mr. Perch\nserve a jail sentence, or would a fine and probation with community service\nsuffice?Secondly, if his actions are found to require a jail sentence, for\nhow long?Possible Penalties[2]The Securities Act provides for fines up to $1,000,000 and\nimprisonment of up to two years.The Crown has asked for a jail term of 12 to\n14 months and probation and defence has asked for probation and community\nservice work.Both counsel agree that probation can be imposed by virtue of The\nSummary Convictions Act, but that a conditional sentence is not available.I am not being asked to order restitution.The Facts[3]Over a 2¾ year period between 2001 and 2004, Mr. Perch, then the\ngolf pro at the Transcona Golf Club, solicited $380,000 from eight investors.He told them he was going to expand his golf-related business interests.Investors, who included golf club members, an employee and strangers solicited\nthrough newspaper ads, were promised interest rates of 20% per year, wholesale\ngolf equipment which they were permitted to resell, and other extremely\nattractive incentives.[4]At no time was Mr. Perch registered to sell securities under The\nSecurities Act.He says that he was not aware he had to register, and the Crown\ndid not elect to prove otherwise.[5]It appears Mr. Perch deposited all the monies invested into his\npersonal bank account.Monies invested went in and out of Mr. Perch’s\naccount very quickly, often disappearing in a matter of weeks.For a period of\ntime, obligations were apparently kept – interest and other payments were made\ntotalling, according to his lawyer, about $100,000, so the actual loss to\ninvestors would have been that much less.However, in 2003 interest cheques\nbegan to be returned as there were insufficient funds in Mr. Perch’s bank\naccount to cover them.Nevertheless, Mr. Perch continued to solicit other\ninvestors, by newspaper ads and otherwise, apparently then using their money to\npay interest to previous ones.[6]By the end of May 2003, on most days Mr. Perch’s bank account\nreflected negative balances, and on July 23, 2003, it was closed with a\nzero balance.[7]Mr. Perch solicited the apparently most vulnerable investor, Dave\nReimer, his employee and a person with a tragic past, initially in 2001 and\nthen again in August of 2003.At a time when it does not appear Mr. Perch\neven had a bank account, he had Mr. Reimer “reinvest” $20,000 that he had\noriginally invested in 2001, as well as invest additional funds for a total of\n$65,000 - money that Mr. Reimer had received as royalties on a book about\nhis life.Apparently, after an incorrectly performed circumcision,\nMr. Reimer had lived his first twelve years as a female.According to\nMr. Martel, “everyone” at the Transcona Golf Club knew about this, so\nMr. Perch would have known as well.Nevertheless, Mr. Perch made\ncontractual promises to Mr. Reimer which were almost too attractive to\nresist.As late as August of 2003, when Mr. Perch was already in\nfinancial difficulty, he offered 20% interest and full time employment on an\ninvestment of $50,000.He then contracted for an additional $15,000, promising\n$5,000 in interest and return of the principle in just four months.According\nto witness Robert Martel, Mr. Reimer, who is now deceased, lost both his\njob and his money.Mr. Reimer had worked for Mr. Perch and was not\ngetting paid.After Mr. Reimer complained to the Board of the Transcona\nGolf Club, Mr. Martel approached the Securities Commission, because he was\nupset at. what had happened to Mr. Reimer.[8]Paul Marchinko, aged 23, responded to a newspaper ad in the spring of\n2003 ‑ when he would have only been about 20 years of age.He was\nlooking to invest his savings.He was told by Mr. Perch that\nMr. Perch either had land or was going to get land for a driving range,\nand was looking at investing in other golf courses.Mr. Marchinko was\ntold he could get his money back at the end of six months - that is, on October 7, 2003.At the time he signed the contract with Mr. Marchinko,\nMr. Perch’s bank account was overdrawn.Nevertheless, the contract\nprovided for interest of 20% per year, and the principal of $20,000 repayable\nin October.Mr. Marchinko was also promised a “consulting fee of $400 per\nmonth, wholesale merchandise, one round trip airfare to Toronto and a 5%\ncommission on any investor he might be able to bring in.Mr. Marchinko\nwent to a “business lawyer” and after being advised by that person, signed the\ncontract and paid the money.[9]Mr. Perch declared bankruptcy in December of 2004, listing the\ntotal amount invested by each of the investors, as well as about $400,000 in\nother debt.Approximately $70,000 of the $380,000 invested was actually\nreinvested by two investors, so the amount of principal outstanding, at least\nin regards to these charges, was actually about $310,000.[10]Three victim impact statements were filed prior to sentencing.One was\nfrom the widow of Joe Stemkoski.Mr. Stemkoski had died of cancer in May\nof 2003.Mr. Stemkoski invested $75,000 in his personal capacity, and\napparently more through his business, the latter not being the subject of\ncharges.He made his investment in May of 2002 and, according to his widow,\nthere were problems with failed undertakings by May of 2003, when\nMr. Stemkoski was terminally ill with cancer.Mr. Stemkoski met with\nMr. Perch in that month, three days before his death, in a futile attempt\nto get back the money to leave for his young family.Mrs. Stemkoski,\nafter outlining the toll Mr. Perch’s actions have had, concluded by\nwriting, “I hope that any sentence imposed upon Mr. Perch by this\nHonourable Court will mirror for Mr. Perch, what we, his victims, have\nfelt.”[11]A trial began before me in November of 2005.Although Mr. Perch\nhad the right to a trial and while there were obviously some legal issues, it\nwas after he heard the compelling testimony from the first witnesses, and\nespecially from Mr. Martel about the consequences to Mr. Reimer, that\nMr. Perch decided to plead guilty.In the meantime, Crown and witnesses had\nhad to prepare for, and anticipate, a trial.[12]A Pre-Sentence Report was prepared.Mr. Perch has no previous\ncriminal record.The report is unremarkable except for the lack of genuine\nremorse the probation officer noted in Mr. Perch.Although Mr. Perch\ntold her he felt “horrible” about his offence, and he told her that he believed\nthe investments “were legal as lawyers were involved in the transactions,” he,\naccording to her, “demonstrated little remorse for his actions and appeared to\nbe more concerned about how his actions have affected himself and his socio‑economic\nstatus”.He apologized in court, but I also thought his apology appeared\nhollow.He did file letters of reference and a list of awards.Undoubtedly,\nMr. Perch is well thought of by many and has done positive things, but\nthose acts pale beside the damage done to the people who trusted him with their\nmoney.[13]Mr. Perch’s counsel admitted that some of the money had gone to pay\nMr. Perch’s personal expenses.Some must have gone into the pro shop.When I asked Mr. Perch where the rest had gone, his only answer was that\nit went toward the promotion of a “ladies night” and to advertising.He blamed\neverything on the Transcona Golf Club’s terminating his contract two years\nearly.The termination, however, did not occur until November 18, 2003,\nmonths after cheques started being returned and Mr. Stemkoski being unable\nto get his money back.A year earlier, the Club had removed the collecting of\ngreen fees from Mr. Perch’s control.The Club revenues had then risen\n$100,000 over that period.[14]Although Mr. Perch is presently employed, albeit only as a courier,\nand he lives at his sister’s without being required to pay rent, as yet he has\nnot paid any money back to any investor or investor’s family.The Precedents[15]The Crown has asked for a sentence of 12 to 14 months incarceration,\nciting the Edgar, Bachewich, Werbeniuk and Zitzerman\ncases.She argued that Edgar and Werbeniuk were important\nbecause they set out the purpose of securities legislation and the seriousness\nof breaching it.She cited from Edgar, at paragraph 13, an older case, Bowman,\nas follows:One of\nthe principal purposes of the Securities Act is to protect the “innocent\nabroad” in the investment world from the goldbricker or the rapacious shark\nthat such easy game attract.[16]From the Bowman case also, Edgar quoted the other\nprinciple:…the\ndividing line between imprisonment and monetary punishment as the appropriate\npenalty must be in which class the offender falls, the merely careless or the\ndesignedly evasive delinquent who is bent on defrauding the public unhindered\nby the watchful supervision of the Commissioner’s investigators.[17]In Werbeniuk, former Associate Chief Judge Miller also cited Bowman\nand adopted the same “test” for determining whether a fine or jail was the\nappropriate penalty.[18]Factors considered by the court in Edgar included the lapse of\ntime, the monetary amount taken and lost, and the breach of trust of his\nfriends and of his new contacts.[19]Looking at the Bowman “test” and the continuum of culpability, does\nMr. Perch fall into the category of offenders who are “merely careless”\nand thus entitled to a fine, or is he the “designedly evasive delinquent who is\nbent on defrauding the public unhindered by the watchful supervision of the\nCommission’s investigators” and subject to a term of imprisonment?[20]Mr. Perch does not fit easily into either group but, rather,\nsomewhere in between.I will attempt to place him along the continuum of\nculpability.[21]I find that Mr. Perch is more blameworthy than someone who was\n“merely careless”.He says that he was not aware of the requirement of\nregistration and no evidence being adduced to the contrary, I am required to\naccept that.Certainly he is not, as were the individuals in many of the\nprecedents referred to by the Crown, either a lawyer or a person employed in\nthe field, who would certainly have been aware.But the Crown has argued, and\nI agree, that that is not the end of the issue ‑ that there was\nstill an element of deceit.[22]For example, he told Mr. Robert Martel, “not to worry” (about\nlosing money) because he owned a hotel in B.C. and “money was not a problem”.In fact, although Mr. Perch may have held shares in a hotel, he did not\nown one.[23]Mr. Perch promised a great deal, in person, in written contracts,\nand in newspaper ads.But he then put all the money into his personal account,\nand used some to pay personal expenses and some to pay other investors’\ninterest payments.In fact, Mr. Martel saw that Mr. Perch was still\nrunning an ad for investors in the Winnipeg Free Press after the cheques he had\nwritten to Mr. Martel had begun to bounce.At least during the later\nperiods during which the offences were committed, he had to have known that\nthings were not going well, that he was not making money for his investors,\nthat he was “robbing Peter to pay Paul”, using the money for his own purposes,\nand making contractual promises that he would probably not be able to keep.When he declared bankruptcy in December of 2004, Mr. Perch declared\nliabilities of over $863,000.Although he blamed his financial downfall then,\nas well as in court, on the fact that his contract with the Transcona Golf Club\nwas broken two years before expiry, he obviously knew at the time of\nadvertising and making overly generous contractual promises to at least the\nlater investors that it was highly unlikely that he could fulfill those\ncontracts.I find him more blameworthy than someone who was “merely careless”.[24]It is also admitted by the defence that some of the money taken from investors\nwas used to pay personal expenses of Mr. Perch.This, in my view, brings\nhis actions close to theft.Some of the money may have gone towards inventory\nfor the pro shop.When I asked Mr. Perch, at his counsel’s suggestion,\nwhere the rest had gone, the only answer I got was that it had gone for\n“advertising” and promotion of a “ladies night”.None appears to have gone\ninto another business or toward the purchase of land discussed with one of the\ninvestors.[25]The people the investment contracts were sold to included relatively\nsuccessful golf club members, but also those who just had modest life savings,\nsuch as Paul Marchinko, and especially Joe Stemkoski and Dave Reimer.I did\nnot hear the circumstances of the other investors.The most glaring case is\nthat of Dave Reimer.Mr. Reimer was Mr. Perch’s employee and an\nindividual with personal problems.And yet, Mr. Perch asked him for money\nin 2001, and then again in 2003, when Mr. Perch was apparently in dire\nfinancial straits.Mr. Perch would have known, as did, according to\nMr. Martel, everyone at the Club, about Mr. Reimer’s issues.It\nwould not have required much imagination to conclude that Mr. Reimer was a\nvulnerable individual.This is obviously the most serious offence.[26]Then Mr. Perch solicited a staff member of the Securities\nCommission in November of 2003.[27]Having found that Mr. Perch was more than merely careless, the\nprecedents seem to say a jail sentence is required.I do not see any other\nsentence reflecting the required denunciation and deterrence.I do not believe\na fine and probation with a community service order is adequate.How Long a Jail Sentence?[28]Having decided that a jail sentence is required, what length of sentence\nis appropriate?[29]Counsel for the Securities Commission cited Bachewich and Zitzerman\non the issue of quantum.Mr. Bachewich had 12 victims, who invested\n$250,000, as opposed to Mr. Perch who had eight victims who invested $380,\n000 (or, taking into account that some money was reinvested, $310,000).Bachewich sought investors over a period of four years, while for\nMr. Perch the period was 2¾ years.Mr. Bachewich and Mr. Perch\nwere of similar ages and neither had a criminal record.However,\nMr. Bachewich, very significantly in my mind, had previously been employed\nby a brokerage firm and was also charged with fraud under the Criminal Code.He received 27 months on the fraud charge and 17 months concurrent on the\ncharge under The Securities Act.He was obviously not claiming to be\nunaware of Securities Act legislation.His offences under The\nSecurities Act involved false reporting, rather than failure to register.A sentence which was concurrent to a sentence for fraud in my mind of\nquestionable value as a precedent.[30]Mr. Zitzerman was sentenced under the previous sentencing regime -\nwhere the maximum jail sentence was one year and the maximum fine $2,000.The\nchanges came into effect October 19, 1988.Mr. Zitzerman was an\n“experienced lawyer of many years” who “should have, or ought to have known,\nthat such dealings required registration under the Act.”His actions were\ndescribed by the sentencing judge as a “designed, deliberate, and wilful act on\nhis part to avoid the strict sanctions imposed on traders by The Securities\nCommission, and by the Act.” (at page 2).Mr. Zitzerman received a\nsentence of 12 months imprisonment.Mr. Zitzerman, however , according to\ndefence and not disputed by Crown, also served a lengthy term in Stony Mountain\nInstitution for other offences - when that sentence was imposed in relation to The\nSecurities Actone I do not know.[31]In Werbeniuk there were fewer victims and a lesser dollar amount\n- less than $54,000.A co‑accused had made some restitution.Mr. Werbeniuk “was not ignorant of the legal requirements upon him.”There was a “predatory tinge” to his conduct.The sentence was one of four\nmonths.[32]In Edgar the accused engaged in the sale of securities to four\nindividuals over five years.The loss was $135,000.The sentence was one of\nfour months.[33]Counsel for Mr. Perch also referred to a number of decisions.[34]Lewandosky, a decision of my brother Chartier, is similar in a\nnumber of respects.The Court accepted that “when Ms Lewandosky first\nstarted to borrow funds from the complainants she did so fully intending to\nrepay them.” In the case of Mr. Perch, I cannot conclude otherwise.However, as with Mr. Perch, “At some later date, she knew or ought to have\nknown that she could no longer reasonably expect to pay these individuals.”The financial and emotional effects were similar, except perhaps in the case of\nMr. Reimer, who was particularly vulnerable, and in that of\nMr. Stemkoski, who died without being able to provide for his family.The\namounts taken by Ms Lewandosky were larger - some $915,000 from nine different\nsets of investors.In her case, about $300,000 had been repaid by the date of\nsentence.Ms Lewandosky exhibited genuine remorse - I find that\nMr. Perch does not.Ms Lewandosky’s sentence of six months was given\nunder the old sentencing regime where the maximum was 12 months.[35]In Whittingdon, a 2000 decision, the same penalty provisions\napplied.Less money was taken - $25,000 - but the accused was in the\ninvestment business.He was given 90 days to be served intermittently.[36]The Alexander, Crimeni and Carmichael cases were\nnot helpful on the issue of quantum.[37]I have concluded that Mr. Perch is less culpable than\nMr. Werbeniuk and Mr. Zitzerman in that they would not have been able\nto say that they were not aware of the requirements of The Securities Act\nand that at least Mr. Werbeniuk was also convicted of fraud.On the other\nhand, the Court in Werbeniuk was able to make compensation orders.However, in terms of remorse and failure to make restitution he is more\nculpable than Ms Lewandosky.The sentencing regime has changed since Lewandosky,\nthe maximum term of incarceration having doubled.Also this case is more\naggravating in my view because of Mr. Reimer and Mr. Stemkoski.[38]In my view the appropriate sentence is one of 10 months and I impose\nthat sentence.That will be followed by 12 months supervised probation.During that time Mr. Perch will report as required, and perform 100 hours\nof community service work.He is not to be involved in the securities industry\nin any capacity nor is he permitted to manage, invest money, or trade in\nsecurities on behalf of others.“J.A.

Carnegie,for the RespondentRespondent)-and-))Joseph Sciascia)O. Wigderson,for the AppellantAppellant)))HEARD:March 10, 2015Morissette J.RULINGOn Appeal from The Hon. Mr. Justice R.McKay conviction and sentenceon November 2nd, 2012, April 5th,2013, June 7th, 2013 and August 27th, 2013[1]The\nissue before the Court in this appeal is whether the Ontario Court of Justice\nhas the jurisdiction to join and proceed to trial on separate informations\nunder the Provincial Offences Act (P.O.A) and Criminal Code\n(C.C.) simultaneously.Background facts:[2]The\nappellant had a single trial before Justice A. T. McKay of the Ontario Court of\nJustice at London, for two C.C. offences (assault with a weapon (a car)\nand dangerous driving) and two Highway Traffic Act (HTA) offences\n(fail to stop for police and fail to report damage to property).[3]The\nappellant was found guilty of dangerous driving and fail to stop for police.He was acquitted on the assault with a weapon and failure to report damage to\nproperty.[4]The\nappellant appeals his convictions on the ground that it is impermissible to\nsimultaneously try charges laid pursuant to the C.C. and charges laid\npursuant to the P.O.A. and, as a result, seeks a declaration that the\ntrial was a nullity.[5]When\nthe appellant’s trial commenced, the C.C. and P.O.A. informations\nwere before the Court. Crown counsel proposed the appellant be arraigned on\nboth informations and counsel for the appellant consented.The Court proceeded\nto try the appellant for all four charges simultaneously.Analysis:[6]In\n1992, the Supreme Court in R. v. Clunas (1992), 1992 CanLII 127 (SCC), 70 C.C.C. (3d) 115\ndecided to reverse the historical law that it was impermissible to jointly try\ncharges set out in two or more informations, even if the charges were laid\npursuant to the same enabling statute.[1][7]The Court\nin Clunas was asked to decide whether the joint trial of one summary\nconviction matter and one indictable matter was a jurisdictional or procedural\nerror.In Clunas, the matters had proceeded to a joint trial on\nconsent of the Crown and defence.In finding that it was not an error to try\nthe matters together in one trial, the Court held:Whether the accused consents or\nnot, joinder should only occur when, inthe opinion of the court, it is in\nthe interests of justice and the offencesor accused could initially\nhave been jointly charged.[2][8]The\nappellant submits that Clunas has provided a two-prong test to determine\nwhether the joinder of two informations ought to be allowed to proceed in a simultaneous\ntrial as follows:First, by asking whether the two separate informations could\nbe joined in a single information?And second, whether the same rules of\nprocedure and evidence govern the two informations?[9]The\nCrown submits that the comments made in the Clunas’ decision that\njoinder should only occur when the offences could initially have been jointly\ncharged, relates to the C.C. restrictions on joinder pursuant to\nsections 589 to 593 of the C.C.Given that the court in Clunas\nwas dealing with the joinder of two C.C. charge informations, (i.e. one\nindictable and one summary conviction), the Crown submits that is why the Court\nhad to make this comment.[10]The\nCrown further submits that its position is supported by the reference made in Clunas’s\nimmediately following the statement relied upon by the appellant, when the\ncourt states:I would adopt the American\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedureformulation, which is as follows[3]:The court may order two or more indictments or informations or both to\nbe tried together if the offences and the defendants, if there is more than\none, could have been joined in a single indictment or information.The\nprocedures shall be the same as if the prosecution were under such single\nindictment or information.I\nwould also add, quoting from the Law Reform Commission’s WorkingPaper 55,\nat p. 39, the following:…\nany particular aspects of the rule in favour of severance would have to be\ninapplicable in order for this judicial joinder to occur.This rule would thus\nreflect the rule for unsuccessful severance on a joint charge.[11]The\nCrown asks this Court to interpret Clunas not as prohibiting the joint\ntrial of a P.O.A. information and a C.C. information, but rather,\nas a statement abandoning the previous rigid adherence to antiquated procedural\npractices.[12]The\nissue of whether a C.C. information and a P.O.A. information\ncould be heard at the same time was not before the Court in Clunas, nor\nwas the issue ever specifically addressed according to both parties before this\nCourt.[13]The\nCourt in Clunas concluded that when the joinder of offences (or of a\nnumber of accused for that matter), is considered, the Court should seek the\nconsent of both the accused and the prosecution.If consent is withheld, the\nreasons should be explored.Whether the accused consents or not, joinder\nshould only occur when, in the opinion of the Court, it is in the interests of\njustice and the offences (or accuseds) could initially have been jointly\ncharged.[14]As\nindicated earlier, Clunas was dealing with two C.C. charges.Whether the offences or accuseds could have initially been jointly charged is\nan issue that speaks to the nexus of the fact situation. If the nexus is found\nthen, whether the separate informations could have been joined initially is not\nof importance when you consider adopting a principled approach taking into\nconsideration the interest of justice, including the efficient use of judicial\nresources, while ensuring not to prejudice the interests of the accused.[15]As set\nout in R. v. Krisza2007 ONCJ 471 (CanLII), Morneau J. reviewed the law of\njoining C.C. charges and P.O.A. charges and although she did not\norder a joint trial, she refused to order a joint trial as a result of a lack\nof consent by the parties.[4][16]Holding\ntwo separate trials in the matters that arose out of the same set of facts has\nthe potential to result in inconsistent verdicts which, in my view, is not in\nthe interest of justice.[17]A\njudge of the Ontario Court of Justice has the jurisdiction to hear both the C.C.\nand P.O.A. informations separately and is empowered to try provincial\noffences matters as well as summary conviction offences.[18]The P.O.A.\nprovides for its own procedure and specifically in section 2 thereof highlights\nthat there are differences between the procedures in the C.C. and in\nprovincial prosecutions. However, as in this case, the appellant is charged\nunder Part III of the P.O.A. Proceedings were commenced by information. The\nrules of evidence at the criminal trial, including proof beyond a reasonable\ndoubt, etc., would be essentially the same, whether in the summary conviction\ncriminal proceeding or in the provincial proceedings.[19]The\nappellant raises the issue of the difference between the federal and provincial\nrules of evidence that govern the contradicting of one’s own witness. In my\nview, the slight difference between section 9(2) of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. E-10 and section 23 of the Ontario\nEvidence Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. E. 23 did not affect the outcome\nof the trial in this case.The appellant was not prejudiced by it.[20]For\nthese reasons, I find that the decision in Clunas supports the\npermissibility of a more efficient and effective trial process unencumbered by\nartificial rules that serve no useful purpose and rest on no sound principle.[21]Accordingly,\nthe appeal is dismissed.Appeal as to Sentence:[22]At the\noutset, leave was granted to appeal as to sentence.[23]The\nstandard to be considered on an appeal of sentence is whether the sentence\nimposed is a fit sentence. A variation of sentence should only be allowed where\nthe appeal court is convinced the sentence imposed is unreasonable in that it\nis clearly excessive or inadequate, that the sentencing judge applied the wrong\nprinciples or that the sentencing judge failed to consider all the relevant\nfacts.[5][24]The\nappellant submits that the sentencing judge erred in two ways:a) that he\nfailed to recognize in the sentencing phase one of the findings of fact that he\nfound during the conviction phase and that is that the appellant “panicked”;and\nb)he found that general deterrence could only be met by a suspended sentence,\nprobation and a driving prohibition and not by a conditional discharge,\nprobation and a driving prohibition.[25]The\nappellant did not apply for a stay of his prohibition from driving; he\nperformed his community service hours, paid his fine and victim fine\nsurcharge.His probation officer did not recommend any counselling and he is\nno longer required to report to him.[26]At the\ntime of the offences, the appellant was 19 years of age and 21 at the time he\nwas sentenced.He had no prior criminal record and comes from a stable and\nsupportive family.He was a full-time Fanshawe College student living with his\nparents and now, as of the fall of 2014, works full-time as a salesperson for a\nflooring accessories company.[27]At\nissue is whether imposing a suspended sentence is the appropriate sentence\ninstead of a conditional discharge. As the Court of Appeal said in a case in\nwhich a provincial court judge refused to grant a discharge to a pair of\nshoplifters and instead suspended the passing of sentence:We do not think that a suspended sentence is a greater deterrent to\nyouths that may be tempted to steal than a discharge, certainly not a\nconditional discharge with probation.The fact of speedy apprehension, arrest\nand trial with the public disgrace and jeopardy which is thereby occasioned\nshould be sufficient deterrent, and the future of these two young men need not\nbe jeopardized by insisting that they bear a criminal record.[6][28]In the\nconviction phase, the dangerous driving was triggered by what the Court had\nitself characterized as “panic”.However, when it came to the sentencing\nphase, the Court did not mention in his reasons the “panicking” aspect of the\noffence.[29]One\ncould categorise this finding as important to sentencing when the appellant’s\nconduct is entirely out of character and as a young person with above average\npotential to contribute meaningfully to society, and a conviction could\nseriously restrict the appellant’s opportunities in the future.[30]In\nthis Court’s view, given that a discharge would not be contrary to the public\ninterest, the nature and circumstances of the offence does not preclude the\ngranting of a discharge, especially bearing in mind that the Court found the appellant\ndrove away from the officer because the appellant “panicked”, and the\nsubsequent driving was of very brief duration.[31]Accordingly,\nthe suspended sentence for dangerous driving is set aside and replaced with a\ndischarge.Disposition:[32]The\nconviction appeal is dismissed but the sentencing appeal is allowed and\nreplaced with a discharge.______________________Justice J.

Shea...........................................................................for\nthe Defendant, Bobby MathiesonREASONSFORSENTENCEHARRIS J.:INTRODUCTION[1]Bobby Terry Mathieson has entered guilty\npleas to one count of possessing child pornography and one count of printing\nchild pornography and one count of breaching his probation. Crown counsel\nelected to proceed by indictment with respect to all charges.[2]Mr. Mathieson is before me today to be sentenced.[3]Crown counsel suggested that the appropriate\nglobal sentence would be imprisonment for four years less pre-sentence custody\ncredited on a 1:1 basis.[4]In addition, he proposed that I make the\nfollowing ancillary orders:1.a DNA order;2.forfeiture orders for the computer and the media\nseized;3.an order compelling Mr. Mathieson to comply with\nthe Sex Offender Information Registration Act for life; and4.an order pursuant to s. 161 of the Criminal\nCode, limiting Mr. Mathieson’s access to children under the age of 16\nyears.[5]Counsel for Mr. Mathieson suggested that the\nappropriate sentence would be one of time served, being 334 days, credited as\none year plus imprisonment for a further two years followed by probation for\nthree years. He agreed that the ancillary orders would be appropriate.[6]My task then is to determine the appropriate\nsentence here.THE LAW[7]I have had to address this issue with\nrespect to child pornography cases on a number of previous occasions.[1]Rather than repeat\neverything that I have said in those cases, I will limit myself to adopting\nthose reasons and to making the following observations.[8]It is universally accepted that simple\npossession of child pornography is a serious offence. By its very definition,\nchild pornography is created by recording the sexual abuse and sexual\nexploitation of children. These children are victimized for the first time when\nthe pornography is created. They are re-victimized time and time again whenever\nsomeone views those images.[9]This is occurring more frequently than in\nthe past. The advent of digital cameras and the development of the Internet\nhave made more child pornography available to more people, all at the push of a\nfew buttons or keys on their computers, and this is all available in the\ncomfort and safety of the offender’s own home.[10]With greater sophistication on the part of\nlaw enforcement officials, more of these offenders are being apprehended and,\nhence, the number of child pornography cases coming before the courts is\nincreasing at a horrendous rate.[11]I note the comments of Justice De Filippis\nat para. 6 in R. v. Strohmeier, 2007 ONCJ 141 (CanLII), [2007] O.J. No. 1250 (Ont. C.J.) where\nhe said, “... there is a link between images of child pornography and [reduced]\ninhibitions about the sexual abuse of children.”[12]Justice Molloy of the Ontario Superior Court\nof Justice stated at para. 49 of her reasons in R. v. Kwok, 2007 CanLII 2942 (ON SC), [2007] O.J.\nNo. 457 thatCollectors\nof child pornography seek to distance themselves from the direct physical and\nemotional harm caused to children. However, the collectors of this filth are a\nvital part of the evil menace it represents and bear responsibility for its\nmalignant growth right along with its creators.[13]She goes on to say in paras. 50 and 52 that\nthe existence of this ready and eager consumer base could only be seen as an\nincitement to, “[those] ... depraved individuals who ... obviously get some\nkind of extra “kick” out of photographing and videotaping these atrocities and\nhaving other people look at them.”[14]She suggests that one way to deter would-be\npornographers would be, “... by deterring those who are interested in acquiring\nthe pornography.”[15]In light of all this it should come as no\nsurprise that courts have consistently held that the primary focus for\nsentencing in cases of simply possessing child pornography must be denunciation\nand general deterrence. The Criminal Code amendments providing for\nminimum jail sentences reinforce this sentiment. The same principles are even\nmore applicable in cases of printing child pornography while on probation for similar\noffences.[16]The minimum sentence for possessing child\npornography is imprisonment for 45 days if prosecuted by indictment. The\nmaximum sentence is imprisonment for five years.[17]The minimum sentence for printing child\npornography is imprisonment for one year if prosecuted by indictment. The\nmaximum sentence is imprisonment for ten years.[18]There is no minimum sentence for breach of\nprobation. The maximum sentence is imprisonment for two years if prosecuted by\nindictment.THE OFFENCES[19]The facts in this case are that on September\n23, 2012, Mr. Mathieson went to a photo store in St. Catharines where he used\ntheir machine to print 56 photos from digital images files. A store employee\nsaw that these included child pornography and a self portrait and called the police.[20]The police obtained and executed a search\nwarrant for Mr. Mathieson’s residence. They found more hard copy photographs\nthat qualified as child pornography, digital storage devices and two video game\nconsoles that were capable of accessing the Internet.[21]Mr. Mathieson was on probation at the time.\nHe was to keep the peace and be of good behaviour. He was not to possess any\ndigital storage devices.[22]He had been convicted of one count of\npossessing child pornography and one count of printing child pornography. On\nDecember 16, 2010, he was sentenced to time served, being 260 days of\npre-sentence custody plus imprisonment for 16 months, followed by probation for\nthree years.[23]An employee at a computer store read the\npress release following Mr. Mathieson’s arrest and realized that he had left a\ncomputer at the store to be repaired.[24]The police obtained a new search warrant\nauthorizing them to seize and examine the computer. The subsequent search\nturned up 908 images of child pornography and two short video clips of child\npornography. Mr. Mathieson had downloaded these from the Internet and saved\nthem.[25]These images included photographs of very\nyoung children who were naked and had their legs spread and their genitals\nexposed. There were similar pictures with an adult hand touching the children’s\ngenitals. Others showed these children in close proximity to erect adult\npenises. There were photographs showing young female children having vaginal\nand anal intercourse with adult males. Two photos showed a prepubescent male\nand female simulating intercourse. Another photo showed a young child with a\nforeign object inserted into her anus.[26]Clearly then, the offences committed by Mr.\nMathieson are serious ones that cry out for a sentence that will make it clear\nto everyone that such crimes will not be tolerated in our community.[27]Having said that, I must not lose sight of\nthe other principles of sentencing, including rehabilitation. I must not ignore\nthe circumstances in the background of Mr. Mathieson that might mitigate against\nwhat could otherwise be an even longer sentence.BACKGROUND\nOF MR. MATHIESON[28]In Kwok, supra, Justice Molloy lists\na number of generally recognized mitigating factors, including:1.the youthful age of an offender;2.the otherwise good character of an offender;3.the extent to which the offender has shown\ninsight into his problem;4.whether he has demonstrated genuine remorse;5.whether he is willing to submit to treatment and\ncounselling or has already undertaken such treatment;6.the existence of a guilty plea; and,7.the extent to which the offender has already\nsuffered for his crime, for example in his family, career or community.[29]Few of these factors are applicable in this\ncase.[30]I have been provided with the following\ninformation about Mr. Mathieson.[31]He is 36 years old.[32]He is the youngest of five male siblings\nborn to his mother. All five had different fathers. He was placed in the care\nof his maternal aunt at two years of age and adopted by her at 13.[33]He has been developmentally delayed since\nbirth.[34]He reported “a really good childhood”\ndespite his adoption and open heart surgery at age three where he contracted\nHIV through a blood transfusion.[35]He finished high school but is functioning\nat a grade five level.[36]He receives approximately $40,000 from the\ncompensation fund as a result of contracting HIV from tainted blood.[37]He has a history of inappropriate behaviour\ntowards young female children. This began when he was five years old and\ncontinued until he was 20.[38]While incarcerated in November 2012, he\nacknowledged a sexual attraction to children and that he needed help with his\nurges.[39]During his Pre-Sentence Report interview, he\ndenied this.He is unsure of why he offended and indicated that he needed help\nbut could not say what help that would be.[40]He expressed a desire, following completion\nof this sentence, to reside in Niagara Falls close to one of his half-brothers.\nThis brother has a criminal conviction for sexually inappropriate behaviour\ntowards a minor female. He believes his half-brother’s claim that he was innocent\nof the offence.[41]While on probation, Mr. Mathieson attended\nthe Basic Cognitive Sex Offender Relapse Prevention Group Program between\nJanuary and June 2012. He missed three of 20 sessions due to illness. He\nattended the follow up maintenance program from June 2012 until his\nincarceration in November 2012.[42]In June 2012, he failed to inform his\nprobation officer that new tenants, with young children, were moving into the\nupper unit of his rental property.[43]He attended for counselling with a\npsychiatrist in Ottawa. He went twice for phallometric testing. He opted out\nthe first time because of a headache. On the second occasion, he left to go for\ncoffee and did not return for three hours. He then completed part of the\nassessment only before declining to proceed further.[44]The Pre-Sentence Report states that Mr.\nMathieson “is considered at an elevated risk to reoffend” and “Based on the\naforementioned concerns including sexual deviance, non-compliance and his\nrefusal to reside long-term in a supervised environment upon release the\nsubject is considered an unsuitable candidate for community supervision”.ANALYSIS[45]Child pornography is a serious matter and\nthe number of child pornography cases is growing to such an extent that it is\nlike a plague that needs to be stamped out.[46]Accordingly, general deterrence and\ndenunciation must be emphasized in determining the appropriate sentence. That\nsentence must make it absolutely clear to any like-minded individuals that such\nbehaviour will not be tolerated, but rather will result in imprisonment for a\nsignificant length of time.[47]In this case, Crown counsel has argued that\nthis is also one of those cases where the offender must be separated from\nsociety for a long time in order to protect that society.[48]Mr. Mathieson committed theses offences\nafter he had been imprisoned for the equivalent of two years or more for the\nvery same offences. In addition, he was still on probation for those offences.[49]These are very aggravating circumstances\nthat call for the imposition of a longer period of imprisonment this time.[50]As I said before, Mr. Mathieson does not\nqualify for much in the way of mitigation of his sentence.[51]He is not youthful although I recognize that\n36 is not nearly so old as to warrant giving up on his rehabilitation entirely.[52]He is not otherwise of good character.[53]He has shown little or no insight into his\nproblem.[54]Other than pleading guilty, he has not\ndemonstrated genuine remorse.[55]He has not been truly willing to submit to\ntreatment and counselling and has so far undertaken only such treatment as he\nwas compelled to.[56]It cannot be said that he has already\nsuffered for his crime, for example in his family, career or community.[57]I point out that none of these are what I\nwould classify as aggravating factors. They represent mitigating factors that,\nwere they present here, would provide a reason for me to impose a lighter\nsentence than might otherwise be justified. Their absence simply means that Mr.\nMathieson is not entitled to any such mitigation of his sentence.[58]The only true mitigating feature here is the\nfact that Mr. Mathieson entered guilty pleas.I take that to be an expression\nof some remorse and an acceptance of responsibility on his part. It also saved\nconsiderable time on our overcrowded criminal docket.[59]Even giving him credit for that, however, I\nfind that the appropriate sentence here is imprisonment for four years.PRE-SENTENCE CUSTODY[60]Counsel for Mr. Mathieson asked me to give\nenhanced credit for the 334 days Mr. Mathieson spent in pre-sentence\ncustody.[61]During his submissions on this point, I made\nreference to the recent decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v.\nSummers, 2013 ONCA 147 (CanLII), [2013] O.J. No. 1068[2],\nparaphrasing para. 117 which readsThat\nsaid, nothing in these reasons should be understood as suggesting that enhanced\ncredit will be available under s. 719(3.1) to every remand offender on the\nbasis of the absence of remission and parole eligibility. There must be some\nbasis in the evidence or the information before the sentencing judge to support\nthe conclusion that this factor merits enhanced credit for a particular\noffender in a given case.[62]Counsel however declined to call any such\nevidence in support of this request.[63]I also noted that the Information contains\nthe endorsement “Detention order – secondary”.[64]This is important because s. 719(3.1) of the\nCriminal Code, sets out when enhanced credit greater than 1:1 may be\ngiven. It statesDespite\nsubsection (3), if the circumstances justify it, the maximum is one and\none-half days for each day spent in custody unless the reason for detaining\nthe person in custody was stated in the record under subsection 515(9.1) or the\nperson was detained in custody under subsection 524(4) or (8). (emphasis\nadded)[65]Section 515(9.1) states(9.1) Despite subsection (9), if the justice orders that\nthe accused be detained in custody primarily because of a previous conviction\nof the accused, the justice shall state that reason, in writing, in the record.[66]The secondary ground for detention is of\ncourse the protection of the public. I find accordingly that the endorsement\nindicating that Mr. Mathieson was detained on the secondary ground is a clear\nstatement, in writing, that Mr. Mathieson was detained because of his previous\nconviction for the same offences. I am therefore precluded from crediting Mr. Mathieson’s\npre-sentence custody at anything other than a rate of 1:1.SENTENCE[67]Accordingly, I sentence Mr. Mathieson as\nfollows.[68]With respect to printing child pornography,\nI sentence him to time served, being 334 days of pre-sentence custody credited\nas 11 months plus imprisonment for a further 37 months.[69]With respect to possessing child\npornography, I sentence him to imprisonment for one year, to be served\nconcurrently.[70]With respect to breaching his probation, I\nsentence him to imprisonment for one year, to be served concurrently.[71]I also make the following ancillary orders\nwith reference to both child pornography offences.[72]They are primary designated offences and I\nmake an order pursuant to s. 487.051 of the Criminal Code, authorizing\nthe taking from Mr. Mathieson of any number of samples of one or more bodily\nsubstances, including blood, that are reasonably required for the purpose of\nforensic DNA analysis.[73]I am not satisfied that Mr. Mathieson has\nestablished that if an order were made, the impact on him including on his\nprivacy or liberty would be grossly disproportionate to the public interest in\nprotecting society through the effective investigation of crimes of a sexual\nnature, to be achieved by the registration of information relating to sex offenders\nunder the Sex Offender Information Registration Act. Accordingly, I make\nan order pursuant to s. 490.012 of the Criminal Code, that Mr. Mathieson\ncomply with the provisions of the Sex Offender Information Registration Act\nfor the rest of his life.[74]The behaviour of Mr. Mathieson, together\nwith the absence of any explanation for it, causes me concern about the risk\nthat Mr. Mathieson may present to children in general. Therefore I make an\norder pursuant to s. 161 of the Criminal Code prohibiting Mr. Mathieson\nfor life, from(a)attending a public park or public swimming area\nwhere persons under the age of 16 years are present or can reasonably be\nexpected to be present, or a daycare centre, schoolground, playground or\ncommunity centre;(b)seeking, obtaining or continuing any employment,\nwhether or not the employment is remunerated, or becoming or being a volunteer\nin a capacity, that involves being in a position of trust or authority towards\npersons under the age of 16 years;(c)having any contact – including communicating by\nany means – with a person who is under the age of 16 years, except under the\nsupervision of a responsible adult who has knowledge of his offending;(d)using the Internet or other digital network.[75]I make an order pursuant to s. 164.2(1) of\nthe Criminal Code, directing that the property seized by the police,\nincluding any computer, computer parts, loose media storage devices and all Internet\naccess devices shall be forfeited to Her Majesty and disposed of as the\nAttorney General directs.[76]In light of the time to be spent in custody\nand the financial position of Mr. Mathieson, I waive the surcharges.Released:September 24, 2013Signed:“D.A.Harris J.”_________________________D.A.Harris J.[1] See R. v.

GordonDate: 1984-01-11Docket: 1253Between:R.andGordonBayda, C.J.S., Woods and Tallis, JJ.A.Counsel:Carol A. Snell, for the Crown;Peter S. Kolenick, for the accused.[1]Tallis, J.A.: The Crown appeals from a sentence of six months’\nimprisonment imposed on the respondent following his plea of guilty to indecent\nassault of his four year old stepdaughter .[2]At the time of this offence the respondent was 24 years of age. On the\nnight in question he attended a dance with his wife. He became upset with his\nwife and left the dance in an intoxicated condition. He picked up his\nstepdaughter from the babysitter’s place and then proceeded to the family home\nwhere this offence occurred. The injuries sustained by his step-daughter were\ncaused by digital manipulation rather than penile penetration.[3]The aggravating factor in this case is the gross abuse of a child by a\nperson in a parental role. A little girl of four years of age is helpless in\nthe hands of her step-father who should be protecting her rather than abusing\nher in a most reprehensible and revolting fashion.[4]In his favor we observe that the respondent has shown very considerable\nremorse concerning this incident, which so far as his record is concerned, is\nan isolated one. The medical evidence makes it clear that this sexual\nmisconduct was a direct result of his chronic alcoholism. He has now taken the\nnecessary steps to deal with this problem. The real question is whether the\nsentence of six months, is, in all the circumstances, an adequate sentence to\nexpress society’s revulsion for crimes involving breach of trust with young\nchildren who require protection.[5]The learned trial judge had the benefit of detailed psychiatric\nevaluations of the respondent. There is no evidence that the little girl will\nsuffer serious consequences as a result of the offence. The respondent does not\nappear to have an aggressive personality. He is responding to therapy--indeed\nhe has not consumed any liquor since this incident which occurred over one year\nago. We would also observe that he has a good employment record. Society will\nbe better served if this man can be rehabilitated other than put away for a\nlengthy period of time to serve sentence in an environment where he will\nrequire protection from other inmates.[6]The principle of sentencing which emphasizes the need generally to\nexpress society’s revulsion for crimes of this kind by the imposition of a\nlengthy custodial sentence is not a principle which demands a rigid and\ninflexible adherence to it in all cases involving the commission of such\noffences, regardless of the circumstances. The factors of deterrence and\ndenunciation which the court must apply should be balanced against all other\nconsiderations properly taken into account in the sentencing process.[7]In this case the learned trial judge endeavoured to carefully balance\nall factors and concluded that a sentence of six months was appropriate.\nAlthough in most cases this would not be an adequate sentence for an offence of\nthis nature, we are not persuaded that, in the circumstances of this case,\nthere was any error in the custodial term.[8]We do however feel that the interests of justice would be advanced and\nsociety would be better protected by requiring the respondent to be on probation\nfor a period of two years after the expiration of his prison sentence.\nAccordingly the Crown appeal is allowed to the extent that the sentence of six\nmonths’ imprisonment shall be followed by probation for two years on the usual\nstatutory terms and the following special terms:1. The respondent shall report in person to the Chief\nProbation Officer at Yorkton, immediately upon his release and thereafter at\nsuch times and places as the said Probation Officer may require.2. The respondent shall take such counselling and attend such\nprograms for alcohol addiction as his Probation Officer may from time to time\nrequire.Appeal allowed in part."}

Hayes (1989), 1989 CanLII 108 (SCC), 48 C.C.C. (3d) 161, one of the issuesconsidered by the Supreme Court of Canada was the problem ofmissing portions of the trial transcript.The appellant, who hadbeen convicted of first degree murder, contended that theinability to obtain a proper and full transcript of the trialproceedings for an appeal comprises a miscarriage of justicewarranting a new trial.Both the majority and the minority ofthe Supreme Court agreed on the test to be applied where portionsof the trial transcript are missing.On behalf of the majority,L’Heureux-Dub‰ J. stated the test at 165:A new trial need not be ordered for every gap in atranscript.As a general rule, there must be a seriouspossibility that there was an error in the missing portion of thetranscript, or that the omission deprived the appellant of aground of appeal.For the minority, Sopinka J. stated the test at 170:I agree that the correct approach is toconsiderthe effect of the gaps inrelationtoanypossible prejudice to an appellant’sabilityto appeal a conviction.The centralrole which the charge to the jury assumesinanappealofajury’sverdictmustbeconsidered.However, not everygapinthetranscript of a charge will justifygrantinganew trial.As a general rule, a new trialwillonlybeordered where thereissomereasontobelieve that theremaypossiblyhavebeenanerror in the passageofthecharge which was missing or that the omissionotherwise may have deprived the appellantofa ground of appeal. [5]In this appeal, virtually the entire transcript isunavailable.In the circumstances of this appeal, counsel forthe respondent conceded that the Hayes test for granting a newtrial has been met by the appellant. [6]Against this background, counsel for the appellant and therespondent entered into negotiations and reached what wasdescribed by counsel for the respondent as a just resolution ofthe appeal that does not offend the administration of justice.Essentially, what was presented to the court was a jointsubmission. [7]As presented by Mr. Breen on behalf of the appellant, it wasproposed that the sentence be varied to seven years and fivemonths to commence on December 19, 1994 and to be servedconcurrently with the 13 year sentence the appellant was servingon the commencement date, to effect the result that each sentencewould expire on May 19, 2002, and that the appellant wouldabandon his appeal against conviction. [8]In joining in this proposal, counsel for the respondentacknowledged that the appellant has served a significant amountof time in custody on other charges and has achieved success inhis rehabilitation as evidenced by the fact that he was grantedday parole on October 5, 1997, and full parole, on November 13,1998.As well, the appellant is currently employed as anassociate producer for the CBC and is a member of a referencegroup which advises the Solicitor General of Canada on issuesrelating to the Corrections and Conditional Release Act.Counselfor the respondent is satisfied, given the appellant’semployment, current interests and the obvious community response,all of which are outlined in the appellant’s affidavit, that heis re-integrating himself into the community. [9]Although we commend counsel for their efforts in attemptingto resolve this appeal by way of their joint submission, which weappreciate would result in putting an end to the prosecution ofthe conspiracy charge, we do not think that it would beappropriate for this court to give effect to the jointsubmission.We have no difficulty in accepting the position ofboth counsel that the Hayes test has been met and that this is anappropriate appeal in which to direct a new trial.We do not,however, think that it is appropriate for this court to engage ina review of the sentence on the assumption that the conviction iswell-founded.It is our view that should the Crown proceed witha new trial, and if the appellant is convicted or pleads guilty,the trial court will be the appropriate forum to impose theappropriate punishment. [10] In the result, the appeal from conviction is allowed, theconviction is set aside, and a new trial is ordered."}

The parties jointly proposed a sentence of 20 months\nless time served of 5 months. The sentencing judge rejected this joint\nsubmission and imposed a sentence of 5 years plus time served.[2]The appellant submits that the sentencing judge\nmade two errors.First, as he intended to depart significantly from the joint\nsubmission, he ought to have given counsel an opportunity to make further\nsubmissions. He erred by failing to do so, see R. v. Hagen. Second,\nthe sentencing judge failed to accord significant weight to the joint\nsubmission.[3]We agree with the appellant’s first submission,\nand indeed the Crown concedes this error. However, it remains open to this\ncourt to assess the fitness of the sentence. That brings us to the appellant’s\nsecond submission.[4]In our view, the sentencing judge was justified\nin departing from the joint submission. In the light of the seriousness of\nthese offences, a sentence of 20 months would have brought the administration\nof justice into disrepute. The sentence that the sentencing judge did impose, 5\nyears on top of time served, was entirely fit.[5]Accordingly, although leave to appeal sentence\nis granted, the appeal is dismissed.“John Laskin\nJ.A.”“J.C.

Constantine (K.M.)Date: 2002-01-17Lynn Moore, for the Crown;Tony St. George and Mary Boulous, for Ms.\nConstantine;Derek Hogan, for Mr. Noftall.(2000 01 T 318)[1]O’Regan, J.: On\nthe night of September 12, 1998 Joseph and Catherine Clowe, retired senior\ncitizens, spent an evening at home watching television. After the late-night\nnews they went to their separate bedrooms. Sometime early in the morning on\nSeptember 13th their granddaughter, Krista Constantine, aided by her boyfriend,\nFrederick Noftall, broke into the basement of the residence. Both Constantine\nand Noftall were juveniles at the time and their intention was to break in and\nsteal the Clowes’ bank card and leave for the mainland.[2]During the break and entry, Catherine Clowe was\nbrutally strangled and Joseph Clowe was locked in his bedroom. Joseph Clowe was\nsuccessful in opening the window and with the aid of an electrical cord he\ndropped to ground level. He then entered the house through the front door and\nfound his wife’s body in her bedroom. There were two cords around his wife’s neck\nand she appeared lifeless. He called 911. An emergency crew and the police\narrived at which time Catherine Clowe was pronounced dead. Immediately, Krista\nConstantine and her boyfriend, Frederick Noftall, became suspects.[3]Krista Constantine was arrested on the afternoon\nof the 13th of September, 1998. Prior to her arrest she had told three\nteenagers that she was involved in the murder. Shortly after her arrest, and in\nthe presence of her foster mother, she gave a video statement claiming full\nresponsibility for the murder. Both Constantine and Noftall were charged with\nbreak and entry with intent; first degree murder; and two charges of unlawful\nconfinement. They were remanded in custody and denied bail until the trial. A\nyear later while in custody, Noftall gave a cautioned statement to the police\nacknowledging that he alone was responsible for the murder.[4]Both Constantine and Noftall testified at trial.\nThey both blamed each other for the murder and said that their original\nstatements to the police were false. Constantine stated that she originally\ntook the blame for Noftall because she was in love with him and acceded to his\nrequest to solely take the blame for the murder. Likewise, Noftall said that it\nwas his concern and love for Constantine that made him take the blame, but at\ntrial he maintained that the original statement was false. At trial Noftall\npleaded guilty to the break and entry charge. Constantine, in her testimony,\nagreed that she was responsible for the break and entry as well. Both denied\nany involvement in the murder of Catherine Clowe. Constantine’s position was\nthat she was in the living room when she heard a struggle in the bedroom but was\nnot a witness to the murder and was only present after it had occurred. Noftall’s\nposition was that he was reluctant to go into the house after the window had\nbeen broken in the basement and he stayed outside the house for some time. Noftall\nstated that when he finally entered the house, he discovered that Constantine\nhad committed the murder by strangulation.[5]The Jury gave the following verdicts:1. Both Constantine and Noftall were found\nguilty of break and entry with intent.2. Krista Constantine was found guilty of second\ndegree murder.3. Frederick Noftall was found guilty of\nmanslaughter.4. Both were found guilty of unlawful\nconfinement in relation to Joseph Clowe.I had instructed the Jury by way of a directed\nverdict to find both not guilty of unlawful confinement of Catherine Clowe.[6]This is the sentencing decision. Both\nConstantine and Noftall were juveniles at the time the offences occurred. On\napplication by the Crown, both were tried as adults. Convictions now having\nbeen entered, sentence is to be imposed as adults except for parole eligibility\nin relation to Krista Constantine. I intend to deal with them individually for\nthe purposes of sentencing.Krista\nConstantine[7]Krista Constantine has a troubled background.\nThe psychiatric and social history reports show that she had a history of\nsevere neglect as a small child. She had a childhood diagnosis of reactive\ndetachment disorder of infancy which the experts attributed to neglect\nantedating her foster-home placement at the age of 2 1/2. By the time she was\nplaced in the care of a loving foster family, the severe neglect that she\nsuffered as a child had basically taken over her life. This mistreatment led to\nbehavioural disturbances at home and at school.[8]Having been convicted of second degree murder, I\nhave no discretion as to the sentence to be imposed. Krista Constantine has\nbeen tried as an adult and the Criminal Code provides that she is to\nserve a sentence of life imprisonment. The Criminal Code provides that\nthe Jury be asked if they had a recommendation as to the date that she would\nbecome eligible for parole. Because Krista Constantine at the time of the\noffence was under the age of 16, s. 745.3 of the Criminal Code applies\nto the direction that must be given to the Jury when somebody is found guilty\nof first degree or second degree murder. S. 745.3 reads as follows“Persons under sixteen -- Where a jury finds an accused guilty of first degree murder or\nsecond degree murder and the accused was under the age of sixteen at the time\nof the commission of the offence, the judge presiding at the trial shall,\nbefore discharging the jury, put to them the following question:“You have found the accused guilty of first\ndegree murder (or second degree murder) and the law requires that I now\npronounce a sentence of imprisonment for life against the accused. Do you wish\nto make any recommendation with respect to the period of imprisonment that the\naccused must serve before the accused is eligible for release on parole? You\nare not required to make any recommendation but if you do, your recommendation\nwill be considered by me when I am determining the period of imprisonment that\nis between five years and seven years that the law would require the accused to\nserve before the accused is eligible to be considered for release on parole.”[9]This question was put to the Jury and they made\nno recommendation. Although no recommendation was made by the Jury, I still\nhave the discretion to make a recommendation under s. 745.1. The pertinent\nportions of 745.1 relating to this case are as follows:“Persons under eighteen -- The sentence to be pronounced against a person who was under the\nage of eighteen at the time of the commission of the offence for which the\nperson was convicted of first degree murder or second degree murder and who is\nto be sentenced to imprisonment for life shall be that the person be sentenced\nto imprisonment for life without eligibility for parole until the person has\nserved(a) such period\nbetween five and seven years of the sentence as is specified by the judge\npresiding at the trial, or if no period is specified by the judge presiding at\nthe trial, five years, in the case of a person who was under the age of sixteen\nat the time of the commission of the offence;”[10]In deciding whether to exercise my discretion to\nmake a recommendation, I am governed by the factors as listed in 745.5:“At the time of the sentencing under\nsection 745.1 of an offender who is convicted of first degree murder or second\ndegree murder and who was under the age of sixteen at the time of the\ncommission of the offence, the judge who presided at the trial of the offender\nor, if that judge is unable to do so, any judge of the same court, may, having\nregard to the age and character of the offender, the nature of the offence and\nthe circumstances surrounding its commission, and to the recommendation, if\nany, made pursuant to section 745.3, by order, decide the period of\nimprisonment the offender is to serve that is between five years and seven\nyears without eligibility for parole, as the judge deems fit in the\ncircumstances.”[11]The factors listed in 745.5 of the Criminal\nCode which should be considered in fixing the parole eligibility are the\nage and character of the offender, the nature of the offence, the circumstances\nsurrounding the commission of the offence and any recommendations that have\nbeen made by the Jury. In summary, I can recommend that parole eligibility be\nfixed at 5, 6 or 7 years, or if I make no recommendation, then it is deemed\nthat she will be eligible for parole in 5 years.[12]It is blatantly obvious that the offence is of\nthe most serious that one can envisage. This was an unprovoked attack on an\nelderly lady in her home and death ensued in a most brutal way. Although I am\ndealing with parole eligibility, I have taken into consideration the factors\nthat one would normally consider in sentencing both from the authorities and\nthe codification of principles which are now part of our Criminal Code. As\nstated, sentence is mandatory and I am cognizant that any recommendation that I\nmake does not have to be followed by the parole board. The final decision will\nbe dictated by the circumstances when the accused becomes eligible for parole.\nIn considering whether or not I should make a recommendation, I rely on the\nreports I have received pursuant to 16.2(3) of the Young Offenders Act and,\nmost importantly, on the psychiatric report. Dr. Craig’s psychiatric report\ndated December 16, 2001 lists his opinions and recommendations as follows:“1. Ms. Constantine has a history of severe\nneglect as a small child, a childhood diagnosis of reactive detachment disorder\nof infancy (which Dr. Aldridge attributed to neglect antedating her foster home\nplacement at age 2 1/2) and a history of self-mutilation, and other behavioural\ndisturbances at home and at school.“2. Ms. Constantine has a substantial\nhistory of substance abuse, her preferred substances of abuse being alcohol,\ncannabis and diazepam (valium). She undoubtedly merited the diagnosis of\nalcohol and poly-drug abuse until shortly prior to her arrest. Whether her\nsubstance abuse would be in remission had she access to substances of abuse or\nnot is unknown.“3. Ms. Constantine was given a diagnosis\nof conduct disorder by Dr. R. Vardy in October 1998 and borderline personality\ndisorder by Dr. U. Jain in January 1999.“4. I do not see any evidence of any\nacute mental disorder at this time, nor do I see any current evidence of a\npersonality disorder. However I would not put much weight on my failure to find\nany current evidence of personality disorder in view of the fact that she has\nbeen in a highly structured environment for over three years and, more\nparticularly, in view of her previous history. [Emphasis added]“5. Although Ms. Constantine did not wish\nto discuss the offenses in question, she expressed remorse for the death of her\ngrandmother and her part in that death which she implied was a passive one.“As Ms. Constantine has been convicted of\nsecond degree murder, I assume that she will receive a life sentence and that\nshe will be eligible for parole sometime in the next few years.“In light of that assumption, my\nrecommendations are as follows“ 1. Following her sentencing and presumed\ntransfer to a Federal Institution, Ms. Constantine should undergo a\ncomprehensive assessment by a multidisciplinary mental health team to ascertain\nher needs and how best to meet them. Particular areas to be assessed include\nher history of childhood neglect (and probable abuse) and its effect on her,\nher behavioural difficulties during childhood and adolescence, her history of\nsubstance abuse and her offenses and their aftermath. This team should be\nprovided with copies of this report, the corresponding clinic note and the\nreports and letters referred to in the clinic note. (Emphasis added)“2. Ms. Constantine should undergo whatever\ntreatment is felt to be appropriate after this assessment is completed and\nshould comply with whatever treatment is offered to her. I expect that this\nwill include appropriate counselling to help her come to terms with the offenses\nin question, her role and responsibility for these offenses and their effects\nthat they have had on her life.“3. Ms. Constantine should be encouraged to\npursue her education and appropriate training to prepare her for an appropriate\ncareer after her release on day parole and/or parole.”[13]The character of Krista Constantine is one of\nthe important factors to be considered in making a recommendation for parole\neligibility under s. 745.1. Dr. Craig has suggested that before being eligible\nfor parole, a comprehensive assessment by a multi-disciplinary mental health\nteam should take place. The merits of this recommendation are obvious. Parole\nwill be determined after such an assessment, especially when risk is taken into\nconsideration. For me to make a recommendation without such an assessment would\nbe to make a decision as if viewing “a crystal ball”. In essence, a\nrecommendation without this relevant background information would border on\nspeculation.[14]By not making a recommendation, I realize that\nthe Criminal Code provides that parole eligibility will be 5 years.\nNevertheless, the parole board still has the authority to decide when parole\ntakes place and considering risk assessment, she may not be paroled after the\nexpiration of 5 years. I am confident that the board’s decision on parole will\ntake place after a full review of all the background information. The offence\nof second degree murder, and the circumstances surrounding the charge, are in\nthemselves sufficient grounds to warrant a determination that parole\neligibility could be 7 years. Nevertheless, the assessments from all the\nsources suggested, coupled with Krista Constantine’s behaviour during her\nperiod of incarceration, will dictate when the proper time arrives for her\nrelease.[15]In summary, circumstances dictate that it would\nbe inappropriate for me to make a recommendation at this time.[16]As to the other two convictions of break, entry\nwith intent and unlawful confinement, the Crown has suggested a sentence of 5\nyears on each count and no serious issue was taken with that suggestion by the\ndefence. Considering the fact that there is a life mandatory sentence on the\nsecond degree murder charge, any sentence that I would have imposed in relation\nto these two charges would have been concurrent. As the accused has been on\nremand for 3 years, I will exercise my discretion in giving credit for that\ntime, which I deem to be a credit of 6 years. In that regard, the sentences for\nbreak and entry with intent, and unlawful confinement, will now be deemed to be\ntime served.[17]Under the provisions of s. 109(1) and 109(3) of\nthe Criminal Code there will be a life prohibition on weapons.[18]Because Krista Constantine was a young offender\nwho was raised to adult court, her placement on conviction is still covered by\nthe Young Offenders Act. Under s. 16.2(1) (c) her sentence shall be\nserved in a penitentiary because it is greater than 2 years. Counsel for the\nCrown, and defence, agree that under the provisions of s. 16, as well as the\nauthorities, I have the jurisdiction to not only decide where the placement\nshould be, but also whether the placement should be under maximum supervision\nor otherwise. I am aware of the fact that it is policy that people convicted of\nsecond degree murder are placed in maximum security for a number of years for\nassessment. I am satisfied, however, and counsel agree, that I have the\nauthority to order that considering the circumstances such as age and\navailability of treatment, education and other resources, as well as the number\nof years that will be served prior to parole eligibility, that this sentence\nshould be served in a Federal institution but not maximum security.[19]In summary, Krista Constantine is sentenced as\nfollows:1. Second degree murder -- Life imprisonment2. Break entry with intent -- Time served3. Unlawful confinement of Joseph Clowe -- Time\nserved4. Mandatory life weapons prohibition[20]I make no recommendation as to parole\neligibility.Frederick\nNoftall[21]Mr. Noftall pleaded guilty to the break and\nentry with intent charge and was found guilty by the Jury of manslaughter in\nrelation to the death of Catherine Clowe and unlawful confinement regarding\nJoseph Clowe.[22]I will deal with the sentencing on each charge\nseparately.Manslaughter[23]A year after the offence occurred Fred Noftall\ngave a cautioned statement to the police stating that he alone was responsible\nfor the murder of Catherine Clowe. At trial he denied any involvement with the\nmurder and explained to the Jury that his original admission as to his guilt\nwas false. His explanation was that he was requested by Krista Constantine to\ntake the blame and because he was still in love with her, he decided to do\nthat. Having changed his story at trial, he explained to the Jury that when\nthey did the break and entry he stayed outside of the house for some time\nbecause he had hoped that Krista Constantine could steal the bank card on her\nown. When she did not return, he entered the house and discovered that the\nmurder had occurred.[24]At a pre-charge conference, all counsel agreed\nthat I should put manslaughter as a possible verdict for either accused to the\nJury. Manslaughter was a possibility because both accused had agreed that they\ndid the break and entry with intent, but both denied any involvement with the\nmurder. The charge for manslaughter arises out of these circumstances in that\nthe Jury could find that although either party agreed to be involved with the\nbreak and entry with intent to steal, and although one of them was not involved\nin the murder, they could still be found guilty of manslaughter based on their\ninvolvement in the unlawful act of break and entry with intent.[25]It is obvious from the verdict that the Jury\nbelieved Mr. Noftall. When one considers the direction given to the Jury, the\nonly conclusion that can be drawn is that the Jury accepted his explanation. In\nthat regard, I find it important to quote my directions to the Jury on\nmanslaughter:“As I have instructed you, either one or\nboth of the accused can be found guilty of first degree murder, or second\ndegree murder, as the principal offender, or accomplice, using Section 21 which\ndefines Parties to the Offence. Because of the circumstances of this case, I\nwill also discuss with you the offence of manslaughter.“You will recall that my instructions to you\nare that each accused can only be found guilty of murder as an accomplice if he\nor she knew of the co-accused’s intention to kill Catherine Clowe or to cause\nher bodily harm that he or she knew was likely to cause death and if the\naccomplice intended to aid or abet the co-accused. Alternatively, either of the\naccused could be found guilty of murder pursuant to Section 21(2) which is the\nsection dealing with co-perpetrators, if you are satisfied beyond a reasonable\ndoubt that he or she formed an intention in common with the co-accused to\ncommit the robbery and that the accused knew that the commission of murder\nwould be a probable consequence of carrying out that intention.“You will recall when I spoke to you about\nintent in relation to murder. I said that the intent for manslaughter was\nsomewhat different. I am now going to instruct you on the intent that is\nnecessary for manslaughter.“If you are left in doubt about the\naccomplice’s knowledge of the co-accused’s intention to kill the deceased, or\nto cause bodily harm that he or she knew was likely to cause death, the accused\ncan be convicted of manslaughter if he or she intended to aid or abet the\nco-accused in committing the offence of break and entry and knew that a\nprobable consequence of the break and entry with intent to commit the offence\nof theft was bodily harm resulting from the dangerous act which was undertaken.\nIn making a determination of whether or not he or she knew that bodily harm was\na probable consequence, you would use the test of what a reasonable person in the\nsame circumstances would have foreseen.“As well, either accused can also be\nconvicted of manslaughter on the application of Section 21(2) co-perpetrators.\nManslaughter would be the appropriate finding if you find that either\naccomplice lacked the intent to commit murder as I explained it to you but you\nfind that in pursuit of a common intention to steal, one of the accused\ncommitted murder, and a reasonable person in the accomplice’s position would\nhave foreseen at least the risk of bodily harm to the deceased.”[26]The Jury then was entitled to find either\naccused guilty of manslaughter on this charge. They were entitled to find\neither accused guilty of manslaughter if they were satisfied beyond a\nreasonable doubt that:1. In committing the offence of break and entry\neither one of them knew that a probable consequence was that bodily harm was\nforeseeable; or2. either party lacked the intent to commit\nmurder, but in the pursuit of a common intention to steal, one of them did\ncommit murder and the other party would have foreseen at least the risk of\nbodily harm.[27]In finding Frederick Noftall guilty of\nmanslaughter, the Jury found objective fault. In essence, the Jury found that\nhe was not the perpetrator of the murder but found that a reasonable person in\nhis position could have foreseen that a possible consequence of the break and\nentry was bodily harm or at least foreseen the risk of bodily harm. Returning a\nverdict of manslaughter means that I must take the facts found either expressed\nor implied by the Jury. S. 724(2) of the Criminal Code states:“(2) Where the court is composed of a judge\nand jury, the court(a) shall accept\nas proven all facts, express or implied, that are essential to the jury’s\nverdict of guilty; …”[28]In considering sentencing, I am also aware of\nthe fact that had the Jury found Fred Noftall guilty of murder either as a\nprincipal or an accomplice, he would have been found guilty of second degree\nmurder and although he was tried as an adult, his parole eligibility would have\nbeen taken into consideration and he could have been eligible for parole after\na minimum of 7 years. When being sentenced for manslaughter, his age is not\ntaken into consideration and he is sentenced as an adult, but obviously, in\nsentencing him for manslaughter, which is unintentional murder, I have\naddressed my mind to what his sentence would have been had he been convicted of\nintentional murder.[29]I now turn to the matter of sentence for\nmanslaughter. As I stated, the finding of guilt in relation to manslaughter\ncomes from the direction and clearly shows that the Jury entered the conviction\nbased on the fact that a reasonable person in Frederick Noftall’s position\nshould have foreseen that:i. a probable consequence of the break and entry\nwith intent to commit the offence of theft was bodily harm resulting from that\ndangerous act, orii. in pursuit of a common intention to steal,\nmurder was committed by Krista Constantine, and Frederick Noftall would have\nseen at least the risk of bodily harm in carrying out that common intention to\nsteal.[30]The Criminal Code provides a statutory\noutline for sentencing:“Purpose“718. The fundamental purpose of sentencing\nis to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the\nlaw and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just\nsanctions that have one or more of the following objectives(a) to denounce\nunlawful conduct;(b) to deter the\noffender and other persons from committing offences;(c) to separate\noffenders from society, where necessary;(d) to assist in\nrehabilitating offenders;(e) to provide\nreparations for harm done to victims or to the community; and(f) to promote a\nsense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgment of the harm done to\nvictims and to the community.“Fundamental Principle“718.1 A sentence must be proportionate to\nthe gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.“Other Sentencing Principles“718.2 A court that imposes a sentence\nshall also take into consideration the following principles:(a) a sentence\nshould be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or\nmitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender….(b) a sentence\nshould be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar\noffences committed in similar circumstances.”[31]The offence of manslaughter was addressed by\nJustice McLachlin (as she then was) in R. v. Creighton, 1993 CanLII 61 (SCC), [1993] 3\nS.C.R. 3; 157 N.R. 1; 65 O.A.C. 321; 83 C.C.C.(3d) 346, at page 374:“The most important feature of the stigma\nof manslaughter is the stigma which is not attached to it. The Criminal Code\nconfines manslaughter to non-intentional homicide. A person convicted of\nmanslaughter is not a murderer. He or she did not intend to kill someone. A\nperson has been killed through the fault of another, and that is always\nserious. But by the very act of calling the killing manslaughter the law\nindicates that the killing is less blameworthy than murder. It may arise from\nnegligence, or it may arise as the unintended result of a lesser unlawful act.\nThe conduct is blameworthy and must be punished, but its stigma does not\napproach that of murder.”[32]Manslaughter, by its very definition, is an\nunintentional crime and in this case, according to the findings of the Jury,\nmanslaughter arose as the unintended result of the unlawful act of break and\nentry with intent to commit theft. Although manslaughter is an unintentional\ncrime, the unlawful act has resulted in a tragic death. The Victim Impact\nStatement by the family members expressed their great loss and considering\ntheir expected desire for vengeance or retribution would, from their\nperspective, call for a lengthy sentence. Mercer, J., addressed this dilemma in\nR. v. Canning (C.) (1996), 1996 CanLII 11553 (NL SCTD), 148 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 1; 464 A.P.R. 1\n(Nfld. T.D.), where he benefited from the guidance given by our Court of Appeal\nin R. v. Woodward (H.) (1993), 1993 CanLII 8183 (NL CA), 108 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 240; 339 A.P.R.\n240, at page 254.“The purpose of a sentence is not to exact\nretribution or vengeance for the criminal offence - and a senseless death. To\ngreatly oversimplify a very complex matter, vengeance is not a principle of\nsentencing and ought to play no part in the process… Whatever the public\nperception, the sentencing judge is obliged to rely on certain concepts\ncharacterized as the ‘principles of sentencing’.” (p. 252)“The common misunderstanding, as logical as\nit may be, is to think of a sentence and the punishment levied as somehow or\nother equal to or to be balanced against the particular enormity of the loss of\nthe human life involved. That of course is impossible. It is true that in the\noffences described above, bodily harm or death will probably result in the\nincrease of a sentence, but there is no attempt to evaluate, assess, or\ndetermine the goodness, quality or usefulness of a human life. Imposition of a\nsentence is not an attempt to reflect the ‘worth’ of a particular human being.\nThat is not the function of a court of criminal law. I repeat, the thrust of\nthe court sanction by way of sentence is to curtail criminal activity and in\nthat effort the sentencing judge must abide by the generally accepted\nprinciples of sentencing and that includes a disposition that is proportionate\nto the offence for which an accused has been convicted and, depending upon the\nfacts and circumstances established in each case, within the range appropriate\nto the offence.” (p. 254)[33]The range for sentence in manslaughter is from a\nsuspended sentence to life imprisonment. The authorities given to me by counsel\nare helpful but none are on all fours with the unique circumstances of this\ncase. The facts that make this case unique are that the Jury found that\nFrederick Noftall did not participate in the murder of Catherine Clowe but did\ncommit a break and entry and, as a result of that unlawful act in which he\nassisted, a tragic death occurred. In sentencing Mr. Noftall I have been\nassisted by the principles in Woodward as well as the statutory\nprovisions in the Criminal Code.[34]Like Krista Constantine, Mr. Noftall comes from\na troubled background. Dr. Craig, in testimony, suggested that he was a person\nwho was capable of being at serious risk to reoffend, but that assessment was\nbased upon Dr. Craig’s assumption that Mr. Noftall was involved in the murder.\nThis was not the finding of the Jury and it is on their finding that I must\nimpose sentence. I have taken into consideration the principles of sentencing,\nand in particular the seriousness of the offence. I am also cognizant that the\naccused has a lengthy criminal record and like Krista Constantine comes from a\ntroubled background.[35]I accept the position taken by counsel for Mr. Noftall\nthat he should be given credit for time served. The normal calculation when a\nperson is on remand is to take into consideration the time served and double it\nfor the purpose of sentence. Although the principle is not binding authority, I\nsee no reason, under the circumstances here, to deviate from that principle.[36]Considering the principles of sentencing, and\nthe authorities, I find that a suitable sentence for a person such as Mr. Noftall\nwho was involved in a break and entry with the intent to steal, but not the\nmurder itself, would be 7 years. Taking into consideration a 6-year credit for\ntime served, I impose a sentence of 1 year in Her Majesty’s Penitentiary.[37]On the break and entry with intent, and unlawful\nconfinement, I would have imposed a sentence of 5 years concurrent to the\nsentence of 7 years I would have imposed had Mr. Noftall not been on remand.\nConsidering that I am giving him credit for time served in the amount of 6 years,\nthe sentences in relation to the break and entry and the unlawful confinement\nwill be time served.[38]Under the provisions of s. 109(1) and 109(3) of\nthe Criminal Code there will be a life prohibition on weapons.[39]I have discussed with counsel and they agree\nthat because the sentence for Mr. Noftall, considering all the circumstances,\nis 1 year, I am able to impose probation as well. In that regard, I impose a\nperiod of probation for 2 years after Mr. Noftall’s release from prison under\nthe following conditions:1. Keep the peace and be of good behaviour.2. To participate in any treatments deemed\nbeneficial by his supervisor.3. Have no contact with Joseph Clowe or any\nmembers of his family.4. Report to his supervisor within 2 days of his\nrelease from prison.5. Mr. Noftall will report to the Clerk of the\nCourt on Monday, January 21, 2002 at 10:00 a.m. at which time the probation\norder will be explained to him in terms of his failure to comply and carry out\nthe provisions and penalties for any breaches as provided by the Criminal\nCode.Accused sentenced."}

Marriott, 2014 NSCA 28Date:20140325Docket:CAC 352265Registry:HalifaxBetween:Aaron Gregory MarriottAppellantv.Her Majesty The QueenRespondentJudges:Oland, Fichaud and Farrar, JJ.A.Appeal Heard:October 2 and 3, 2013, in Halifax, Nova ScotiaHeld:The fresh evidence motion is allowed, leave to appeal is granted,but the appeal is dismissed, per reasons for judgment of Oland, J.A.; Fichaudand Farrar, JJ.A.Counsel:ElizabethD. Cooper, for the appellantMarkScott, for the respondentStaceyGerrard, for Kevin Burke, Q.C.Reasons for judgment:[1]In the early evening hours of November 18, 2008,\ngunshots rang out in the parking lot of the children’s hospital in Halifax.Within a month, Aaron Marriott was arrested and charged with three attempted\nmurders, one conspiracy to commit murder, and several weapons offences.He plead\nguilty to one attempted murder and, in accordance with a joint recommendation\nby the Crown and his trial counsel, was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment.He\nappeals his sentence and applies to introduce fresh evidence to support his\nappeal.[2]The appellant submits that the sentencing judge,\nJustice Kevin Coady of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, erred because\nessential facts concerning the offence as supplied by the Crown were incomplete\nor wrong, so he did not receive due process.He also maintains that he did not\nhave the requisite intent for attempted murder, suggests that certain\nparticulars were overlooked, claims breaches of his Charter rights, and\nargues that his sentence was demonstrably unfit.He does not allege\nineffective assistance of counsel.[3]In R. v. Marriott, 2013 NSCA 12 (CanLII) (“Marriott\n#1”), this panel dealt with certain matters pertaining to this appeal.Fichaud\nJ.A., for the court, determined that Mr. Marriott had impliedly waived his\nsolicitor-client privilege with his former counsel, Kevin Burke, Q.C. to the\nlimited extent as prescribed in that decision.He also held that the Crown’s\nmotion for dismissal of the appellant’s grounds of appeal relating to alleged\nbreaches of the Charter was premature.As I will explain later, that\ndecision led to additional filings, including a fresh evidence motion, and\ncross-examination of certain affiants at the hearing of this appeal.[4]For the reasons which follow, I would allow the\nfresh evidence motion, grant the leave to appeal, but dismiss the appeal.Background:[5]I begin by quoting from Marriott #1 which\nincluded a summary of theprocedural history pertaining to the charge, the plea\nand joint recommendation, and the sentencing hearing:[4]Mr. Marriott was charged,\non a multi-count information, with attempted murder of Jason Hallett.His\nco-accused were Jeremy LeBlanc, Matthew Murphy and Shaun Smith.[5]The event occurred on the\nevening of November 18, 2008 outside the IWK Children’s Hospital in Halifax. …[6]Mr. Marriott elected a\ntrial by judge and jury in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia.He was\nrepresented by Mr. Kevin Burke, Q.C., an experienced criminal counsel.According\nto the comments by counsel to the trial judge, there had been an extensive and\nlengthy evaluation of evidence and negotiation between the Crown and Mr.\nBurke.Mr. Burke said he had “extensive discussions with my client, before an\nagreement was reached here”.As a result, on the opening day of trial, April\n26, 2011, Mr. Marriott entered a guilty plea to attempted murder under s. 239\nof the Criminal Code.Justice Kevin Coady of the Supreme Court of Nova\nScotia presided.The sentencing was adjourned to May 16, 2011, to enable the\nCrown and defence to place before the Court the basis for their joint\nrecommendation on sentence.No pre-sentence report was requested.[7]The guilty plea and joint\nposition incorporated more than one file for which Mr. Marriott was subject to\nprosecution.The plea and recommendation were premised partly on the Crown’s\nwithdrawal of an eleven count indictment alleging, among other things, another\nattempted murder by Mr. Marriott on the same victim three months before the IWK\nevent.[8]The sentencing hearing\nproceeded on May 16, 2011, Justice Coady again presiding.[9]At the sentencing hearing,\nthe Crown’s brief included a statement of facts … that both counsel informed\nthe sentencing judge was not in dispute.The Crown and Mr. Marriott’s counsel\njointly recommended a forward sentence of fifteen years, meaning no reduction\nfor remand custody from the fifteen years.Mr. Marriott’s counsel informed the\ncourt that Mr. Marriott understood the implications, including segregation, of\npenitentiary time for his offence.Mr. Marriott attended during the sentencing\nhearing on May 16, 2011, addressed the Court after hearing the submissions by\nthe Crown and his own counsel, said he took full responsibility, and said “I\nhave to face the consequences and take my punishment”.[6]An elaboration of the facts leading to this\nappeal is necessary to provide the requisite context.On April 26, 2011 when Mr.\nMarriott elected to be tried by a judge and jury, Mr. Burke asked that the attempted\nmurder charge be read and said that the appellant would enter a plea.The\ntranscript sets out Mr. Marriott’s plea of guilty and the judge’s questions to\nhim, including in regard to disclosure:COURT CLERK:AARON GREGORY MARRIOTT, you stand charged that on or about the 18th day of\nNovember, 2008, at or near Halifax, that you did attempt to murder Jason\nWilliam Hallett while using a firearm, by discharging a firearm at Jason\nWilliam Hallett, contrary to Section 239(a) of the Criminal Code.\"How\ndo you plead?AARON MARRIOTT:Guilty.THE COURT:Any comments on the remaining counts?MS. SMITH:Yes.Again, My Lord, it would be the Crown's intention, if that plea is accepted, to\nwithdraw the remaining counts on the indictment.We have, again, a request for\nan adjourned sentencing date.The date convenient to Mr. Burke and myself\nwould be May 16th at 9:30 a.m., for two hours.And we will have a\njoint recommendation to make to the court at that time.THE COURT:Thank you.All right.Mr. Marriott, you've indicated that ... you have\nindicated your willingness to plead guilty to count number 2, as I understand\nit?AARON MARRIOTT:Yes, Your Honour.THE COURT:All right.You understand ... And you've received disclosure; you understand\nwhat they're alleging you did?AARON MARRIOTT:Yes.THE COURT:All right.And can you assure me that no one is bringing any\npressure to bear on you to plead this out?AARON MARRIOTT:No, Your Honour.THE COURT:And you understand that you are presumed innocent, as you stand here now, until\nI accept your plea, but you're giving it up and you're going to be guilty?AARON MARRIOTT:Yes.THE COURT:You understand that?AARON MARRIOTT:Yeah.THE COURT:And you understand that the joint recommendation that may, that\nyour counsel and Ms. Smith have spoken about, that I'm not necessarily bound by\nthat?AARON MARRIOTT:Yes, I understand.THE COURT:Okay.I'm prepared to accept his plea.… I'll put Mr. Marriott's\nsentencing over til May 16th at 9:30 a.m. …[7]Ms. Smith advised that she would have the\nIndictments, which contained charges that would be withdrawn, brought before\nthe court on May 16th.Mr. Burke confirmed that no pre-sentence\nreport was sought.[8]The transcript of the May 16, 2011 hearing included\nthe Crown’s and trial counsel’s submissions on sentencing and their joint\nrecommendation.The submissions recounted the event which led to the charge of\nattempted murder and some particulars about the appellant.Thetranscript reads\nin part:MS. SMITH:And\nas I had indicated to the Court, and I believe it may have been indicated on\nthe day that Mr. Marriott entered his plea, my friend and I have a joint\nrecommendation before the court today's date.THE COURT:All right....SUBMISSION ON SENTENCING BY MS. SMITHMS. SMITH:...The facts in relation to this matter are referred to at length in\nthe brief filed by the Crown, and I will touch on them briefly.These matters\nare not in dispute as between my friend and myself.The sequence of events that unfolded on November 18th of\n2008 unfolded very rapidly, beginning with a call from the girlfriend of Jeremy\nLeBlanc, an associate of Mr. Marriott's, advising that one Jason Hallett could\nbe located at the IWK Hospital in downtown Halifax.Within half an hour of that call being received, Mr. Hallett was\nshot by Mr. Marriott in the front area of the hospital's parking outside of the\nentrance, these events having unfolded with that call and the result being that\nMr. Marriott, along with others, traveled to the hospital via two separate\nvehicles.Once there, Mr. Hallett was located, quite by chance, as he had come\nout of the building, from visiting his infant child, to have a smoke and to\nobtain more cigarettes from a friend.At the time that Mr. Hallett was shot by Mr. Marriott, Mr. Hallett\nwas shot while seated in the passenger seat in the front of a Jeep Cherokee\nbeing operated by the person who had come to provide him with cigarettes.There was another individual who was in the back seat at that time.This\nshooting occurred at approximately 6:45 p.m. on a weekday evening.Mr. Hallett\nwas shot at close range with a handgun.He was struck in the wrist, and this\nwas despite the fact that witnesses would say anywhere from three to five shots\nwere fired into the Cherokee.Certainly, on a forensic examination of the\nvehicle, the vehicle was hit with at least three distinct projectiles.The\ninjury that Mr. Hallett suffered was superficial; it required some treatment by\nway of stitches at the Emergency, and Mr. Hallett was certainly releasable that\nday.The motivation for this crime, as if there could ever be any good\none, was simply that Mr. Hallett had switched allegiances from one rival crime\ngroup to another.Mr. Marriott is 20 years of age.He comes before the court with 22\nprior convictions, those convictions having been entered between 2004 and\n2011.Essentially, the last seven years saw Mr. Marriott amass these 22 prior\nconvictions.In 2004, when his criminal record began, he was a mere 13 years\nof age.All of his prior convictions, save for one, had been committed while\nhe was a youth.The one that has been committed since he was an adult\noccurred while he was on remand in relation to this offence and related to ...THE COURT:Did you say of the 22 prior convictions ...MS. SMITH:Yes.THE COURT:How many were as a youth?MS. SMITH:21.THE COURT:21 as a youth.MS. SMITH:21\nof those.The one prior or the one conviction that occurred as an adult\noccurred since Mr. Marriott has been on remand for this offence and relates to\na mischief offence that occurred in the correctional facility.This record of Mr. Marriott's includes crimes of violence, weapons\noffences and drug trafficking.We do not have the benefit of a pre-sentence report before the\ncourt.My friend and I have discussed this matter, and I'm sure Mr. Burke\nwill have much to say about Mr. Marriott's personal circumstances.I can\nrecall, certainly, from reading past pre-sentence reports in relation to Mr.\nMarriott, that he was said to come from a law-abiding family, to have had the\nbenefit of a good upbringing, to have had opportunities to have played hockey\nand engage in sports as a young person.Very clearly, this was a lifestyle\nthat Mr. Marriott chose....The\nrecommendation that my friend and I have reached, on a very considered basis,\nYour Lordship, is for a sentence of 15 years' imprisonment.That would be on a\ngo-forward basis, with no credit for the remand time that Mr. Marriott has\nserved to date, which has been since his arrest some two and a half years ago,\nin December of 2008.Effectively, the recommendation that the Crown makes and\nwhich my friend has joined in has already taken into account the remand time\nthat Mr. Hallett(sic) [from transcript] has served.This is a primary\ndesignated offence and, as such, we're asking that a DNA order be made.I have\nprovided a copy to the clerk for the court.My friend has a copy.As well,\nthere is a mandatory firearms order and, because of the previous order made\nagainst Mr. Marriott, that order should be for life....SUBMISSION ON SENTENCING BY MR. BURKEMR. BURKE:Thank you, Your Honour, My Lord. The facts that the Crown has outlined to the\ncourt, for the most part, I don't take issue with.The comments concerning\nMr. Hallett, I think, deserves a little more elaboration than maybe what my\nlearned friend has pointed out to the court.Mr. Hallett was carrying a handgun at the time, carrying a handgun\ninside the Children’s Hospital, a loaded handgun. It’s very difficult to appreciate\nthe emotional impact that this particular incident had on Mr. Hallett, given\nthe fact that he has quite a history in terms of his participation in one\ncriminal gang versus another, the fact that he was carrying a handgun into a\npublic children’s hospital on, I believe it’s on the second floor, for no other\npurpose, I would respectfully suggest, than had he had to use the handgun, that\nthe handgun would have been there for use. And so I point that out to the\ncourt, not in the sense that if any particular person is a victim of violence\nthat, obviously, they’re going to suffer some degree of trauma as a result, but\ngiven the fact that there are special circumstances as it relates to Jason\nHallett that I think need to be taken into consideration, as well.As my learned friend has pointed out, there have been extensive\ndiscussions in respect to this matter.The discussions not only focused on the\nIWK incident but also has focused on other matters that, as Your Lordship can\nsee, are presently before this court and will be dealt with as part of the\nwhole submission that's being made here this morning.The discussions as it\nrelates to this joint recommendation commenced close to a year ago.They've\nbeen ongoing for some considerable period of time.I have had extensive\ndiscussions with the Crown, as well, extensive discussions with my client,\nbefore an agreement was reached here.A number of factors have been carefully\nconsidered and, in particular, the strength of the Crown's case as it related\nto this particular incident and also as it relates to the other matters that\nare presently before the court.So the sentence that's being suggested here\nis not an undue lenient sentence, by any stretch of the imagination.It's a 15\nyear sentence, commencing today, that also recognizes that Mr. Marriott has\nbeen in custody since December of 2008, December 11th, 2008.So\nhe's got 29 months in pre-trial custody.Now, obviously, that has to be\nreflected, and it is reflected, the fact that he is, essentially, being\nsentenced without any two-for-one credit being considered at all, that he's\nlooking at 17 years and five months....Now,\nof course, the difficulty that he's facing is that ... and Mr. Marriott knows\nthat, as well as a lot of us, that he'll be sentenced and he'll be sent to\nRenous and, because of past associations, he will be dealt with accordingly.In other words, he will be segregated.He will be segregated with his past\nassociates, which creates an almost insurmountable difficulty in trying to extract\nhimself from a never-ending scenario.He will then be in the same situation\nthat he would have been, say, growing up, when he was 13 or 14 or 15, in\nSpryfield, or the same thing in Burnside.There's no course corrections here.What, in essence, will happen is that there'll be a lot of associates that\nwould be put on the same range as Mr. Marriott, from the officials' point of\nview, more for control than anything.No attempt at rehabilitation of any\nmeaningful, in any meaningful way.It will be simply a matter of control.And\nconsequently, he has to be looking at a sentence of 15 years that really\nnothing is changing in his environment.He's in the same environment that he\nmoved out of in Spryfield into Burnside and on to Renous.The only possibility\nthat he has is to, essentially, apply for a transfer, which everyone else is\ndoing.And that even follows him wherever he goes, whether it's B.C. or\nOntario or Alberta, that the association of being involved with a\n\"gang\" automatically characterizes him and where he's going to be\nplaced in whatever institution.So it's a very difficult future that a 20-year-old faces.Even if\nhe has a sincere and honest desire to somehow change his life, if he recognizes\nthat he has a level of intelligence that can allow him to change, he recognizes\nthat the only person that is going to give him any assistance, any assistance\nwhatsoever, is himself.And this is something he's learned in Burnside, that\nhis contacts, his communications with, say, professors at Acadia may open a\nworld to him, but you can see, without much further consideration, that that's\na very, very small part of what his life is going to be like when he's sent to\nRenous.He recognizes that unless something should come out of these efforts\nthat he's making, in terms of trying to get a university degree, that he's\nlooking at two situations: one, that he'll end up doing two-thirds of his time\n- he's 20 years old, he's ... he knows that - not one-third of his time, by\nvirtue of his being associated, his being, I guess, pigeon-holed or\ncharacterized.So you're looking at 10 years, not five years, in terms of\nwhen he actually has a realistic possibility of being released.So he's,\nessentially, going to be from 20 to 30 years old at the time when he is\napplying....Mr.\nMarriott ...What I'm, essentially, relating to the court today, Mr. Marriott\nhas related to me, over a number of discussions that we've had over the past\nseveral years.These are views, these are feelings that he has expressed to me,\nthat I'm passing along to the court.And it's a rather tragic situation that\nwe are looking at today.It is a joint recommendation, and Mr. Marriott is prepared, he\nunderstands what 15 years is all about and he's prepared to accept it and to\ndeal with it.And the way he's going to try an (sic) deal with it is the way\nthat I've explained it to the court today.Those\nare my comments.THE COURT:Mr. Marriott, would you like to say anything?AARON MARRIOTT:Do you think I could have a brief recess first?Is there any\nway ...[9]After a recess of a full hour, Mr. Marriott addressed the judge and\ntook sole responsibility for his actions.He even exonerated two of the others\nwho had been charged.The transcript reads:THE COURT:...All right.Mr. Marriott, did you wish to say something, sir?AARON MARRIOTT:Yes, Your Honour.I've prepared a few things.THE COURT:Well, you go ahead, sir.AARON MARRIOTT:First of all, Your Honour, I would like to take this moment to\naddress the court.I would like to apologize for what I did.I am very\nremorseful, and I definitely regret my actions on that night.I would also\nlike to apologize to the public for what I did.What I did was unacceptable\nand I have no excuses for what happened, but what did happen should have never\ntaken place in the location that it did, under any circumstances.I am sorry\nfor what I did, but I deeply regret that it happened in such a public place.I would like to apologize to my family for everything that I've put\nthem through.They also suffered the consequences of my actions.They also\nfeel the punishment.So I am sorry for everything that I put them through.I\nnot only messed up my own life but also theirs.I would also like to sincerely apologize to two people, in\nparticular, Jeremy LeBlanc and Matthew Murphy, and also their families.I am\nsorry for dragging them into this mess.What I did was unpredictable and\ncompletely out of character for me.Jeremy LeBlanc and Matthew Murphy are\ncompletely innocent.They are both standing trial because of my actions and\nthe decisions that I made.There is no way possible that they could have\nknown what I was going to do that night.Unless they had psychic abilities,\nthey didn't know what was about to happen.I didn't even know what I was going\nto do.I'm not sure exactly when I made the decision, but it was sometime\nbetween getting out of my vehicle and walking toward the victim.It was my\nfault for having a loaded handgun on me.There was no way that Jeremy or\nMatthew could have known I was carrying a gun on me.I am using this\nopportunity to let the courts know that two completely innocent men are facing\ncharges because of my actions.And what I done has affected so many people -\nmy family, them, their families, the victim, his family, all the people that\nwere at the IWK that night when I did what I did.I'm responsible for what\nhappened, and not them.I can't explain the weight that I have been carrying with me during\nthe last two and a half years that I have been incarcerated, knowing that my\nactions have affected as many people's lives as they did.I have no excuses\nfor what I did.I definitely regret it.There's no way that I can undo it.And I know that all there is now is I have to face the consequences and take my\npunishment.THE COURT:Thank you, Mr. Marriott.AARON MARRIOTT:Thank you for your time, Your Honour.[10]The judge then accepted Mr. Marriott’s\nre-election to judge alone for an 11-count Indictment.After the Crown advised\nthat it would not be offering evidence on any count other than one attempted\nmurder, the judge dismissed the remaining ten charges.[11]At the beginning of their submissions on\nsentencing, both counsel referred to the facts as contained in the Crown’s\nbrief.The Crown told the judge that those facts quoted “are not in dispute as\nbetween my friend and myself”.Similarly, Mr. Burke stated that “[t]he facts\nthat the Crown has outlined to the court, for the most part, I don’t take issue\nwith”.He did add that Mr. Hallett had a loaded handgun at the time.No evidence\nwas presented at the sentencing, and no pre-sentence report was prepared.[12]The statement of facts in the Crown’s sentencing\nbrief recounted the events of November 18, 2008 and the arrests of Messrs.\nLeBlanc, Murphy, Smith and Marriott.According to the appellant, errors and\nomissions in this document led to the imposition of a demonstrably unfit\nsentence.Here is what the statement of facts said:Part 1 – Facts1.On\nNovember 18, 2008, Jeremy Leblanc (hereinafter “LEBLANC”) and his associates,\nincluding Aaron Marriott (hereinafter “MARRIOTT”) made a plan to kill Jason\nHallett (hereinafter “HALLETT”).They were unaware that while they made this\nplan the police were listening.2.Operation\nIntrude was a joint investigation by RCMP and Halifax Regional Police into Criminal\nCode and C.D.S.A. offences being committed by a targeted group of\nindividuals who were subject to surveillance of different varieties, including\nphone intercepts.MARRIOTT, LEBLANC, and Shaun Smith (hereinafter “SMITH”)\nwere known to police to be members of a group working in the illicit drug trade\nand referring to themselves as the “Spryfield M.O.B.”3.On\nthe date in question, judicial authorization to intercept MARRIOTT, LEBLANC and\nSMITH’s phone calls, and phone calls of other LEBLANC associates, was obtained\nby police.Consequently, the phone conversations that took place between and\namong LEBLANC, MARRIOTT, SMITH and Matthew Murphy (hereinafter “MURPHY”) as the\nplan to kill HALLETT developed, were recorded.4.On\nNovember 18, 2008, at approximately 6:09 pm, LEBLANC received a phone call from\nhis then-girlfriend, Jennifer Hachey, who worked at the IWK Children’s Hospital\nin Halifax.Hachey told LEBLANC that HALLETT was at the IWK hospital.LEBLANC\ntold Hachey, “just do your job, okay?”(see Intercepts, Tab 1).5.LEBLANC\nproceeded to communicate by phone with each of SMITH and MARRIOTT, informing\nthem that HALLETT, a member of a rival gang, was at the IWK Hospital.LEBLANC\nwas already proceeding to the IWK hospital in a vehicle with MURPHY.MARRIOTT\nand SMITH drove together to the IWK hospital in a Chevrolet Blazer that was\nmissing its rear window, and that had clear plastic affixed in the place of the\nrear window with bright red tape.The Blazer’s license plate was ENM 609.6.MARRIOTT\nand SMITH stopped to meet with Dawn Anne Bremner at approximately 6:26 pm,\nbefore carrying on to the IWK hospital.7.While\nproceeding to the IWK hospital, MARRIOTT phoned LEBLANC to clarify where Hachey\nworked, and LEBLANC confirmed to SMITH and MARRIOTT that HALLETT was located at\nthe IWK hospital: “the same place we were lookin’ before” (see Intercepts, Tab\n9).During this phone conversation, LEBLANC directed MARRIOTT not to run right\nin to the hospital in order to carry out their plan, since Hachey was working\nthere, and her employer “might fuck around with her later.”8.HALLETT\nwas at the IWK hospital because his child had been born there a few days\nearlier, and the child was still admitted to the hospital.9.LEBLANC\nand MURPHY arrived first together at the IWK hospital on the evening of\nNovember 18, 2008.From within their vehicle, they covertly observed HALLETT\noutside the hospital, and passed information about HALLETT’s location to SMITH\nby phone.HALLETT had come down from visiting his child inside the hospital in\norder to smoke a cigarette outside of the hospital, and in order to obtain more\ncigarettes from a friend.HALLETT had a handgun in his possession at that\ntime.10.When\nLEBLANC indicated to SMITH over the phone that HALLETT might be leaving the\nhospital grounds, SMITH expressed to LEBLANC a desire to block HALLETT from\nleaving.11.Subsequently,\nafter it became evident that HALLETT was not leaving the hospital yet, LEBLANC\nand MURPHY, while on the phone with SMITH, drove beside HALLETT’s exact\nposition, and MURPHY told SMITH that HALLETT was “right there on the right.”At this point, SMITH is heard saying, “gimme, gimme the gat” (see Intercepts,\nTab 11).12.Shortly\nafterward, in a subsequent phone call, LEBLANC and MURPHY told SMITH that\nHALLETT had jumped into a Cherokee (a Jeep sport utility vehicle).13.In\nthe final phone call before HALLETT was shot, LEBLANC and MURPHY confirmed the\nlocation of the Cherokee, “right in front,” to SMITH and MARRIOTT (see\nIntercepts, Tab 13).SMITH then told MARRIOTT, “get out and blaze that\nCherokee.”14.At\napproximately 6:45 pm, MARRIOTT then exited the Blazer, dressed all in white\nand wearing a hooded sweatshirt with the hood pulled close over his face, and\nproceeded to walk up to the Cherokee that HALLETT and two other passengers were\nsitting inside.15.MARRIOTT\nfired several shots at close range from a handgun into the Cherokee in an\nattempt to kill HALLETT.Various eyewitnesses reported having heard anywhere\nbetween three and five shots.Forensic analysis revealed that the Cherokee had\nsustained damage from at least three different fired projectiles, and that the\nprojectiles were most likely fired from a .375, .38, or 9 millimetre-calibre\npistol or revolver.16.MARRIOTT\nthen turned and ran back to the Blazer.Once he was inside the Blazer, SMITH\ndrove away proceeding Westbound in an Eastbound lane on University Avenue, and\nthen Northbound on Robie Street.An eyewitness who was in a vehicle behind the\nBlazer on Robie Street called 911 to report the Blazer, as the eyewitness\nsuspected that the driver was intoxicated on the basis of the Blazer’s erratic\nand dangerous driving through traffic.17.HALLETT\nwas hit only once, in the wrist, by the shots that were fired at him.He\nreceived emergency medical treatment at the QEII hospital shortly after the\nshooting, and was discharged from that hospital the same night.18.No\none else was injured in the shooting, although the shooting caused a\nsubstantial disruption to the IWK hospital, which declared a “Code” and a form\nof lockdown in relation to the shooting, and to the witnesses who were all kept\nbehind for hours and asked to provide statements to police investigators.19.Multiple\neyewitnesses who were present in very close proximity to the Cherokee at the\ntime of the shooting, and the IWK hospital security camera footage, all\nindicated that an individual who was dressed completely in white walked up to\nand fired several shots into the Jeep Cherokee.The shooting took place at or\naround a normal IWK hospital staff shift change, so there was substantial\npedestrian and vehicular traffic around the entrance to the hospital at the\ntime of the shooting.20.HALLETT\npositively identified the individual who shot him as Aaron MARRIOTT.Although\nHALLETT was initially reluctant to cooperate with police investigators, he\nindicated to a police officer who was at the QEII hospital on the night of\nNovember 18, 2008, that MARRIOTT was the shooter, and HALLETT has subsequently\nconfirmed this information to the police throughout the investigation into the\nshooting.21.MARRIOTT\nwas arrested on December 11, 2008, for shooting HALLETT; the arrest took place\nafter HALLETT had agreed to cooperate with the police investigation.22.SMITH,\nLEBLANC, and MURPHY were later arrested for their roles in the shooting, but\nonly after the expiration of the Operation Intrude judicial authorization to\nintercept communications that yielded the intercepted phone calls relating to\nthe shooting of HALLETT.23.HALLETT\nhas been placed in witness protection for his safety as a result of his\nparticipation in police investigation into the shooting and his testimony at\njudicial proceedings arising from the shooting.24.HALLETT\nhas suffered substantial psychological trauma as a result of the shooting.He\nis unable to maintain the relationships and the lifestyle that he knew prior to\nthe shooting.[13]After hearing counsels’ submissions, the judge\naccepted their joint recommendation.He sentenced Mr. Marriott to fifteen\nyears’ incarceration.His oral decision of May 16, 2011 included:I\nam familiar with the principles and objectives of sentencing as set out in the Criminal\nCode, and I’m not going to repeat them here. And I’m very familiar with the\nsimilar cases that have been provided to me by counsel that helped me determine\nif the joint recommendation is an appropriate recommendation. And I will say,\nafter consideration of those authorities, I have no difficulty accepting the\njoint recommendation of 15 years. I recognize that the law says I should accept\njoint recommendations unless I can articulate a good reason not to, and I have\nno hesitation in saying, in this case, that I have no such reason that I could\npossibly articulate.... Ms. Smith got it\nright when she described this as a botched first degree murder. ... But when\nour citizens hear about an attempt to murder someone at 6:45 p.m. at the local\nmaternity and children’s hospital, things change considerably. When they hear\nabout someone running up to another person in a vehicle and blasting them three\nto five times with a high-powered pistol, in the middle of that parking lot, it\nsends out a message that’s new to the general community.... But this type of\nshooting and the great possibility of what one could callously call collateral\ndamage has done great damage to our community and our citizens and their sense\nof self, well being.The\nother tragedy is that Mr. Marriott stands before this court as a 20 year old\nperson who’s been in jail for all of his adult life. ...These\nfactors tell me it’s all about accepting peer pressure and wanting to make his\nmark in the criminal community, without very much thought about the\nconsequences of what would happen to the person receiving the damage and\nhimself. In a way, as I was sketching out my remarks, I wanted to say to Mr.\nMarriott just how lucky he is. It’s something I want you to think about in the\ncoming years. Mr. Hallett could be dead, and that would be a lost life, and you\ncould be facing a life sentence with no chance of parole for 25 years.… But I think it’s\nvery clear from the comments of your counsel, and which I know from my own\nexperience, that you must disassociate yourself from your fellow offenders in\njail and over the years, if you want to have any chance whatsoever of a better\nlife in your 30s, 40s, and 50s.… I am going to\nsentence you to 15 years in prison for your involvement in this offence.The Appeal:[14]Mr. Marriott was unrepresented when he filed a Notice\nof Appeal against sentence with this Court.Among other things, he appealed on\n“the basis of incompetent counsel.”That ground was withdrawn when his current\nappeal counsel filed an Amended Notice of Appeal, and other grounds including\nalleged breaches of his Charter rights were added.[15]As mentioned earlier, this panel dealt with\ncertain matters pertaining to the appeal in Marriott #1.We found that\nMr. Marriott had impliedly waived solicitor-client privilege.This Court subsequently\nreceived an affidavit sworn by Mr. Burke, his trial counsel.[16]On his appeal, Mr. Marriott sought to adduce\nfresh evidence.His grounds of appeal submit that:1.the sentence constitutes cruel and unusual\npunishment pursuant to s.12 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms;2.the sentence is demonstrably unfit;3.the sentence is unduly disparate\ncompared to those of the co-offenders; and4.notwithstanding the joint\nrecommendation, the trial Judge failed to place sufficient emphasis on\nmitigating factors.I will deal with the last\nthree items together.Consequently, there are three matters to be decided:(a)whether to receive fresh evidence on appeal (b)whether the sentence\nbreached s. 12 of the Charter, and (c)whether the sentence was\ndemonstrably unfit.Fresh Evidence Motion:[17]The appellant moved to introduce evidence which\nwas not presented when he was sentenced because the sentencing went forward by\nway of joint recommendation.[18]In Marriott #1, Justice Fichaud described\nthe Court’s request to Mr. Marriott’s counsel to list those items which the\nappellant says were incorrect in the Agreed Statement of Facts before the\nsentencing judge and her response.He also summarized extracts from the brief\nfor the fresh evidence motion, which came before us on the appeal:[23]On January 8, 2013, Mr.\nMarriott’s counsel filed a letter that said “The Appellant disagrees with”\nseven points in the statement of facts that had been put to the sentencing\njudge.Those points of disagreement are significant, and include the wording\nin the statement of facts that:“Marriott made a plan to\nkill Jason Hallett.” (Statement of Fact # 1)“Marriott\n... were known to the police to be members of a group working in the illicit\ndrug trade and referring to themselves as the ‘Spryfield M.O.B.’ ” (Statement\nof Fact # 2)That\nthe victim, Jason Hallett was “a member of a rival gang”. (Statement of Fact #\n5)[24]In her written and oral\nsubmissions to the Court of Appeal, Mr. Marriott’s counsel also contended that,\napart from the inaccuracies, the facts put to the sentencing judge were\nincomplete, as of the date of the sentencing hearing, in a number of material\nrespects.[25]As to how these alleged\ninaccuracies and deficiencies came to be in the position jointly stated to the\nsentencing judge, we have the following.Mr. Marriott’s affidavit of September\n7, 2012, says:18.I was never shown the agreed statement of facts that\nformed part of the Crown’s brief.His factum says:1.... Because of his guilty plea, the facts in relation to\nthe Appellant were not brought forward.His Brief for the Fresh Evidence\nMotion says:22.The Appellant was told, by his counsel, that he would have\nthe weekend to think about the proposed sentence.25.The Appellant had no opportunity to see the agreed\nstatement of facts, nor any opportunity to review the contents of the Crown’s\nposition contained in the Crown’s brief filed at his sentencing, that forms the\nbasis of his sentence.71.The way the Appellant was sentenced, he was left in the\ncold with nothing said about him.93.... He is simply stating the fact that he did not see the\nagreed statement of facts, nor the justification for the Crown’s sentence,\nbefore his sentencing. As well, the sentence that he received, that was agreed\nupon by the Crown and his attorney, was not communicated to him until the day before\nhe pleaded guilty to the offence, on which the sentence is based.109.The nature of the joint recommendation on sentence in the\nAppellant’s case, that excluded any credit whatsoever for the 2.4 years that\nthe Appellant spent in pre-trial custody, silenced [underlining in the\nBrief] Mr. Burke, Q.C. from having any opportunity to raise a Charter argument\non sentencing.156.... very little about his background was brought to the\nattention of the Court at his sentencing.159.While a pre-sentence report would have been of assistance\nin the Appellant’s case, it was not required for a joint recommendation on\nsentence, and neither the Crown nor the defence at trial requested that one be\nprepared.[19]The appellant’s motion to adduce fresh evidence was\nsupported by several affidavits, some with numerous attachments:(a)Mr. Marriott’s affidavit sworn September 7, 2012\nwhich, among other things, deposed that:(i)he had been charged with three attempted\nmurders, one conspiracy to commit murder and several weapons offences and, in\nexchange for the dropping of two of the attempted murders and the other\ncharges, he had pled guilty to the attempted murder of Mr. Hallett;(ii)he was out on his own at age 13, his attempts to\nreturn home were unsuccessful;(iii)his criminal record “consisted of schoolyard\nquarrels”;(iv)while in pre-trial custody, he was kept in\nsolitary confinement for lengthy periods;(v)during pre-trial custody, he completed a high\nschool equivalency and was accepted into Acadia University;(vi)after sentencing, he experienced difficult times\nin the federal penitentiary system, including segregation; and(vii)he was eventually transferred to the medium\nsecurity institution at Drumheller Institution in Alberta, and accepted to\nAthabasca University.(b)His Supplementary Affidavit sworn December 5,\n2012 which provided further details of the conditions of his pre-trial custody\nand, in particular, periods of segregation at Central Nova (Burnside) and at\nthe facilities at Southwest Nova and Cape Breton Correctional, and described the\ncomplaints he made to prison authorities and their responses;(c)His Second Supplementary Affidavit sworn June 25,\n2013 which supplied additional details regarding his treatment in the\ncorrectional institutions;(d)The affidavit of his appellate counsel sworn on June\n28, 2013, to which were appended 11 exhibits intended to provide the full\ncircumstances of the offence for which Mr. Marriott was sentenced. These\nincluded a transcript and audio of the police wiretap evidence, a DVD\ncontaining police interviews of Mr. Hallett, and surveillance videos of the\nshooting outside the children’s hospital;(e)A second affidavit from his appellate counsel, also\nsworn on June 28, 2013, to which were appended documents pertaining to a riot\nat the Central Nova Scotia Correctional Facility (Burnside) on April 8, 2009\nand Mr. Marriott’s sentence on September 24, 2010 to four months in custody by\nJudge D. William MacDonald in an unreported decision, including the transcript\nof the proceedings and the brief filed by his counsel on Charter issues\nfor that matter; and(f)The affidavit of Donald Bureaux, President of Nova\nScotia Community College and part-time lecturer at Acadia University regarding\nMr. Marriott’s performance in his first year business course.[20]In response to the appellant’s fresh evidence\nmotion, the Crown filed 14 documents.These included correspondence between\nthe Crown Prosecutor at trial and Mr. Burke, material pertaining to previous\noffences the appellant committed, a 2006 Pre-Sentence Report pertaining to Mr.\nMarriott, and the sentencing decision pertaining to the appellant’s conviction\nfor property damage in relation to the prison riot.Mr. Marriott then filed\nfurther material in relation to his earlier convictions.[21]The hearing of the motion to adduce fresh\nevidence and the merits of the appeal consumed two days.It commenced with\nshort submissions on whether the Crown should be permitted to cross-examine Mr.\nBurke on his affidavit.The panel determined that this was appropriate.Each\nof Crown counsel and counsel for the appellant cross-examined Mr. Burke.The\nCrown’s cross-examination of Mr. Marriott on his affidavit evidence was followed\nby re-direct by the appellant’s counsel.His counsel then cross-examined Cst.\nBenny Kirton on his affidavit and played portions of the DVD video pertaining\nto the shooting of Mr. Hallett in the hospital parking lot.On the second day\nof the hearing, counsel presented their submissions on the fresh evidence\nmotion and the appeal.[22]Fresh evidence may be received provided the\ncriteria in Palmer v. The Queen, 1979 CanLII 8 (SCC), [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759 as modified by R.\nv. Lévesque, 2000 SCC 47 (CanLII) are satisfied.The evidence should generally not\nbe admissible if, by due diligence, it could have been adduced at trial;however, this criteria will not be applied as strictly in criminal cases as in\ncivil cases.The fresh evidence must be relevant and probative and, when taken\nwith the other evidence adduced at trial, must be expected to have affected the\nresult.The admissibility criteria are the same for appeals against sentence\nas they are for appeals from verdict:Lévesque at ¶ 22.[23]In this case, the proffered fresh evidence was\nnot presented to the judge at the sentencing hearing because sentencing\nproceeded by way of a joint submission.While some of it may have been\navailable then, an appeal against sentencing in the circumstances of this\nproceeding persuades me that the somewhat relaxed due diligence criteria in\ncriminal proceedings has been satisfied.[24]I also accept that the material tendered as\nfresh evidence is relevant and credible, and could have affected the result,\nnamely the sentence imposed on the appellant.In doing so, I observe that whether\nsome of the material was in admissible form may be questionable; however, I need\nnot decide that aspect to determine this appeal.Cruel and Unusual Punishment:[25]The appellant submits that it was the actions by\nthe state that led to inaccurate and incomplete material in the statement of\nfacts before the judge at his sentencing.This then resulted in mitigating\ncircumstances not being presented, including his being subjected to cruel and\nunusual punishment contrary to s. 12 of the Charter while incarcerated.[26]His affidavit evidence shows that while\nincarcerated before sentencing, Mr. Marriott was subjected to several periods\nof segregation.These included ten days of solitary for a fight, 73 days\npursuant to a mischief charge arising out of a prison riot, ten days\nsegregation for a fight in the back of the sheriff’s van, 15 days segregation\nfor another fight, and 11 days segregation for making liquor.He claims that\non other occasions, other inmates caused disruptions for which he was also\nblamed and ended up in segregation.He complains that during periods of\nsegregation, he was locked down for 20 to 24 hours a day, refused fresh air\nalmost every day and forced to wear handcuffs.[27]The appellant deposed that after sentencing in\nthe spring of 2011, he was held in administrative segregation for months during\nwhich he was locked down 22 to 23 hours a day, and only allowed to shower every\nsecond day.He complained several times to the authorities at the correctional\ninstitutions about his treatment when he had not been in any trouble there.In\na request to see a psychologist, the appellant explained that he felt like a\nfish in a fish bowl, and had a permanent headache and severe anxiety when he\nhad never had anxiety before.According to his affidavit, a security\nintelligence officer told him that he was held in segregation because\npreviously the institution had a lot of problems with people from Spryfield or those\nwho associated with them.[28]The appellant raises this Charter argument\nfor the first time on appeal.Generally, new grounds on appeal are allowed\nonly in exceptional circumstances.The appellate court has no trial decision\nto review and the record is often insufficient:R. v. Phillips, 2006\nNSCA 135 (CanLII), at ¶ 30-33.[29]In her dissenting judgment in R. v. Brown, 1993 CanLII 114 (SCC), [1993]\n2 S.C.R. 918 (S.C.C.), L’Heureux-Dubé J. explained the rationale for the\nprohibition at pp. 923-24:.\n. .[T]he general prohibition against new arguments on appeal supports the\noverarching societal interest in the finality of litigation in criminal\nmatters. Were there to be no limits on the issues that may be raised on appeal,\nsuch finality would become an illusion. Both the Crown and the defence would\nface uncertainty, as counsel for both sides, having discovered that the\nstrategy adopted at trial did not result in the desired or expected verdict,\ndevised new approaches. Costs would escalate and the resolution of criminal\nmatters could be spread out over years in the most routine cases. Moreover,\nsociety's expectation that criminal matters will be disposed of fairly and\nfully at the first instance and its respect for the administration of justice\nwould be undermined. Juries would rightfully be uncertain if they were\nfulfilling an important societal function or merely wasting their time. For\nthese reasons, courts have always adhered closely to the rule that such tactics\nwill not be permitted.She also set out at p. 927 the factors that\nmust be satisfied before a new issue, including a Charter challenge, is\npermitted on appeal:… First,\nthere must be a sufficient evidentiary record to resolve the issue. Second, it\nmust not be an instance in which the accused for tactical reasons failed to\nraise the issue at trial. Third, the court must be satisfied that no\nmiscarriage of justice will result from the refusal to raise such new issue on\nappeal.[30]Does the record indicate that the appellant’s\nfailure to bring forwardCharter arguments based on segregation he\nexperienced while incarcerated prior to sentencing was other than a tactical\ndecision?I am not persuaded that it was.[31]It was no surprise to Mr. Marriott that he was\nlikely to be segregated after sentencing.He was in the courtroom when his\ntrial counsel, in making his submissions to the sentencing judge, spoke of Mr.\nMarriott knowing that because of “past associations”, “he will be segregated”\nand that his imprisonment would be a matter of control rather than meaningful\nrehabilitation.The appellant made no protest regarding these comments.[32]Mr. Marriott was also well aware that Charter\narguments could be raised.After all, he had relied on s. 11(h) of the Charter\nat the September 2010 hearing in regard to the property damage charges arising\nfrom the prison riot, for which he was sentenced to four months imprisonment.Yet, at his sentencing in May 2011 for attempted murder, a far more serious\ncharge, for which the Crown was seeking 15 years on a go forward basis, he was\nsilent in regard to Charter issues.Even when he himself was given an\nopportunity to address the court, the appellant made no complaint about the\nconditions of his incarceration as described in his affidavit evidence.[33]Mr. Marriott, in his written and oral\nsubmissions, argues that the joint recommendation “silenced” Mr. Burke from\nhaving any opportunity to raise a Charter argument on sentencing.However, all that was elicited from trial counsel during cross-examination before\nthis panel was that, had he walked in at sentencing and started raising any\nissues, such as Charter arguments,“the thing would have come to an\nabrupt halt and ... I would expect the matter would have been adjourned and\nthere would have been a great deal of discussion as to what, what’s the next\nprocedure.”The “thing” to which Mr. Burke was\nreferring was the negotiated joint submission.His evidence does not amount to\nanything more than the reality that, the Crown and trial counsel having come to\nan agreement, any last-minute challenges or deviations would unwind the joint\nsubmission.[34]It appears that the appellant is equating the\nfact of segregation with prima facie cruel and unusual punishment,\ncontrary to s. 12 of the Charter.But segregation is not an automatic\nbreach of that Charter right.In R. v. Olson (1987), 1987 CanLII 4314 (ON CA), 38 C.C.C. (3d)\n534 (Ont. C.A.), aff’d 1989 CanLII 120 (SCC), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 296 (S.C.C.), the appellant inmate\nsubmitted that his confinement to his cell for 23 hours each day amounted to\ncruel or unusual punishment.Brooke, J.A. writing for the Ontario Court of\nAppeal stated at ¶ 41 that “[s]egregation to a prison within a prison is not, per\nse, cruel and unusual treatment … [but] it may become so if it is so\nexcessive as to outrage standards of decency.”In his reasons, he observed at\n¶ 32 that:… Unlike the complaints in McCann\nv. The Queen (1975), 1975 CanLII 1104 (FC), 29 C.C.C. (2d) 337, 68 D.L.R. (3d) 661, [1976] 1 F.C.\n570 (T.D.), the appellant has not complained about the nature of the place or\ncleanliness or the lack of food or reasonable comfort, or brutality or conduct\nwhich one might think is not necessary for security, nor does he complain that\nhe is arbitrarily denied any privileges ordinarily enjoyed by other inmates\nsave those excluded by the nature of his confinement. …After reviewing all the evidence, he determined\nthat the long-term segregation in that case was not so excessive as to amount\nto a Charter breach.The Supreme Court of Canada affirmed his decision\non a different, narrow issue, which did not require it to comment or endorse Brooke\nJ.A.’s reasoning.[35]Thus, Olson is the leading case on\nwhether segregation constitutes “treatment that is so excessive as to outrage\nstandards of decency”.Since that decision, several cases from trial courts\nacross Canada have found that segregation does not constitute a breach of s. 12\nof the Charter.These include McArthur v. Regina Correctional Centre,\n(1990), 1990 CanLII 7609 (SK QB), 56 C.C.C. (3d) 151 (Sask. Q.B.), R. v. Chan, 2005 ABQB 615 (CanLII), R.\nv. Munoz, 2006 ABQB 901 (CanLII), Wu v. Canada (Attorney General), 2006 BCSC\n44 (CanLII), R. v. Aziga, [2008] O.J. No. 3052 (Ont. S.C.J.), Trang v. Alberta\n(Edmonton Remand Centre), 2010 ABQB 6 (CanLII), R. v. Farrell, 2011 ONSC\n2160 (CanLII), and R. v. Jerace, 2011 ABQB 50 (CanLII).[36]Bacon v. Surrey Pretrial Services Centre, 2010 BCSC 805 (CanLII), appears to be the one reported case where a judge\nfound a s. 12 Charter breach based on segregation.There the appellant\nsuccessfully sought a writ of habeas corpus with certiorari in\naid seeking release from administrative segregation while awaiting trial for\nfirst degree murder.The judge found significant violations of the B.C. Corrections\nAct.The warden of the institution was found to have (¶ 352) “exercised\nthe powers vested in her:(a) for the improper purpose of assisting the police\nin its criminal investigation; [and] (b) in a manner that has improperly\nfettered her discretion by allowing the police to unduly influence the\npetitioner's placement in separate confinement.”[37]Mr. Bacon was locked up for 23 hours a day; he\nhad dirty bedding, cold food and no access to a pen.The lights were left on\nin his cell 24 hours a day and a video camera in his cell recorded and\nmonitored his activities.With respect to communications, there were\nrestrictions on Bacon’s ability to use the telephone, a restriction on all\nvisits except by legal counsel and restrictions on his mail delivery.He was\nalso denied use of an inhaler for asthma.Justice McEwan concluded at ¶ 353:The respondent is in breach of s.\n12 of the Charter in arbitrarily placing the petitioner in solitary\nconfinement, in failing to appropriately mitigate his circumstances in solitary\nconfinement, and in unlawfully denying him the other rights to which he was\nentitled, significantly threatening his psychological integrity and well-being.\nThese impositions collectively amount to cruel and unusual treatment.[38]All of the cases on whether s. 12 rights were\nbreached as a result of segregation are heavily fact-specific; the conditions,\nduration and reasons for segregation must all be considered.Moreover, it is\nessential that there be a proper evidentiary record for the proper\nconsideration of a Charter issue.[39]The jurisprudence indicates that the courts do\nnot lightly interfere with the administration of correctional and detention\nfacilities.For example, in Aziga, Justice Lofchik stated at ¶ 34:It is\nrecognized that the courts ought to be extremely careful not to unnecessarily\ninterfere with the administration of detention facilities such as the\nHamilton-Wentworth Detention Centre where the Applicant is currently held. Unless\nthere has been a manifest violation of a constitutionally guaranteed right,\nprevailing jurisprudence indicates that it is not generally open to the courts\nto question or second guess the judgment of institutional officials. Prison\nadministrators should be accorded a wide range of deference in the adoption and\nexecution of policies and practices that in their judgment are needed to\npreserve internal order and discipline and maintain institutional security.Maltbey\nv. Saskatchewan (A.G.), [1982] S.J. No. 871 (Q.B.)\nat paras. 20 and 41; appeal denied (1984), 1984 CanLII 2546 (SK CA), 10 D.L.R. (4th) 745 (Sask. CA).Almrei v. Canada (A.G.), [2003] O.J. No. 5198 (S.C.J.) at para. 18.[40]Moreover, disciplinary segregation has not been\nconsidered a s. 12 breach.Aziga at ¶ 51-52 reads:As set out above, in certain\ninstances the Applicant was found to have committed (and/or admitted to) an act\nof inmate misconduct for which he was sanctioned with of (sic) close\nconfinement. Incidents for which the Applicant was found guilty of\nmisconduct and sanctioned for his misbehaviour cannot possibly form the basis\nof a Section 12 Charter challenge. This hearing is not an appropriate forum\nfor the Applicant to seek to overturn any earlier inmate disciplinary findings\ngiven the Ministry statutory review process for inmate misconduct matters which\nthe Applicant has not followed.In\nrespect of the Applicant's time spent in close custody detention as a sanction\nfor inmate misconduct, the courts generally have rejected the suggestion that\nthis form of detention per se violates Section 12 of the Charter. The judiciary has been reluctant to second guess administrative\ndecisions made by institutional officials of this nature, which reflect their\nspecial knowledge and expertise with matters relating to institutional safety\nand security.•McArthur\nv.

(2d) 321 (C.A.) at 333-336.[Emphasis added]See also Trang at ¶ 1035-1036 which\nreferred to decisions where lengthy periods of disciplinary and administrative\nsegregation did not amount to a s. 12 breach.[41]In this case, it appears that most of the\nappellant’s time in segregation before sentencing were sanctions for\nmisbehaviour such as fights and participation in a prison riot.This was disciplinary\nsegregation.The remainder are instances where the appellant claims he was a\nbystander or not the instigator.It appears the institution imposed segregation\nfor purposes of internal order, discipline and security.I would be reluctant\nto interfere with its judgment in those matters.This segregation does not rise\nto cruel and unusual punishment.[42]I then turn to the periods of segregation after\nsentencing.According to the appellant’s affidavit evidence, he filed several\ncomplaints and grievances.The earlier ones, made before a correctional plan\nwas completed for him, were about lack of access to programs.In rejecting\nsubsequent complaints seeking reasons for why he was “locked down 23 hours a\nday even though I am not on sanctions”, the institution denied his claim of 23\nhours daily lockdown, saying that he had been given access to showers, outside\nrecreation and gymnasium recreation.[43]In responding to a later grievance regarding his\nsegregation status, the institution wrote in October 2011:… You were segregated for being an\nassociate of the Spryfield MOB.Your association with the gang and the threat\nthat this gang poses as a group in General Open Population creates a risk that\nis not assumable.However, you have been taken off segregation status at your\n5 day review and are now following an enhanced structure routine in unit 3. …The appellant’s continued complaints and\ngrievances did not deny the correctness of the affiliation with a gang described\nin this response.On November 7, 2011 in answer to his second level grievance\nabout having been placed in administrative segregation since his arrival in May\n2011, the Assistant Deputy Commissioner, Atlantic Region, wrote:“[s]ubsequent to your arrival,\nfile information obtained through the RCMP indicated that you were a member of\na criminal organization …”She then set out the relevant material\nincluding portions of CD 568-3 Identification and Management of Criminal\nOrganizations and the Corrections and Conditional Release Act,\nS.C. 1992, c. 20 on administrative segregation.Her letter ended:To conclude, we were informed by\nyour Parole Officer that your Case Management Team is currently working on an\nInter-regional transfer to another region.This would certainly allow you an\nintegration in the general open population.The appellant has not been in segregation\nsince his transfer out of the Atlantic Region.[44]I do not doubt that the appellant found his\nperiods of disciplinary and administrative segregation personally very\ndifficult, and even harsh.He was a young man with no adult offences before\nthe attempted murder and property damage pursuant to the prison riot; it was\nhis first time in prison.Not everything was done in strict accordance with\ntime lines in the legislation and subordinate legislation, and he had to wait\nfor responses to his complaints.However, it appears that with regard the\nadministrative segregation which followed his sentencing, the institution\nofficials made decisions “which reflect their special knowledge and expertise\nwith matters relating to institutional safety and security.”Based on the\nrecord before me, I cannot agree that this segregation amounted to a breach of\ns. 12.[45]It may also be that the Court of Appeal is not the\nproper forum to hear complaints of conditions in prison post-sentence.Mr.\nMarriott did not dispute that the venues for redress set out in the Crown’s\nargument in this respect were incorrect, or were not or are not, available to\nhim.The Crown’s factum reads in part:35.…At the time of any segregation, the Appellant had the following options:(i)seeking\na writ of habeas corpus in Supreme Court;(ii)seeking judicial review of the administrative decisions\nin Federal Court;(iii)launching\na claim of civil tort and/or constitutional tort in Supreme Court.[R. v. Farrell,\n2011 ONSC 2160 (CanLII) ...; R. v. VandenElsen-Finck, 2005 NSSC 71 (CanLII) ...; Samms\nv. Atlantic Institution, 2004 NBQB 140 (CanLII) ...; May v. Ferndale Institution,\n2005 SCC 82 (CanLII) ...; Canada (A-G) v. McArthur, 2010 SCC 63 (CanLII) ...; R. v.\nAziga, 2008 CarswellOnt 4619 (S.C.) ....]36.He may still sue, should\nhe wish.[46]For all of the above reasons, I would dismiss\nthe appellant’s claim of cruel and unusual punishment and a breach of s. 12 of\nthe Charter while he was incarcerated before and after he was sentenced.The Fitness of the Sentence:[47]Mr. Marriott argues that although his sentencing\nproceeded by way of joint recommendation reached by the Crown and his trial\ncounsel, Mr. Burke, and they made oral submissions to the judge as well, the\njudge erred by imposing a sentence that is demonstrably unfit.[48]In his summary factum, which incorporated an\nearlier factum, an earlier brief and previous correspondence to the court, Mr.\nMarriott stated the issue on his appeal thus:“Should\nthe Appellant, who had no home, employment or school, receive double the length\nof the sentence of the actual perpetrators of the offence?[49]Mr. Marriott was sentenced to 15 years on a go\nforward basis.What he considers a fit sentence for himself is a ten-year\nsentence, less a credit of 4.8 years, being his 2.4 years in remand at 2:1.The result would be a sentence of 5.2 years going forward from the date of his\noriginal sentence.(a)Standard of Review[50]The Supreme Court of Canada recently reiterated\nthe standard of reviewfor appeals from sentence in R. v. Nasogaluak,\n2010 SCC 6 (CanLII):[46]Appellate\ncourts grant sentencing judges considerable deference when reviewing the\nfitness of a sentence.In M. (C.A.), Lamer C.J. cautioned that a\nsentence could only be interfered with if it was “demonstrably unfit” or if it\nreflected an error in principle, the failure to consider a relevant factor, or\nthe over-emphasis of a relevant factor (para. 90; see also R. v. L.M.,\n2008 SCC 31 (CanLII), [2008] 2 S.C.R. 163, at paras. 14-15; R. v. Proulx, 2000\nSCC 5 (CanLII), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61, at paras. 123-26; R. v. McDonnell, 1997 CanLII 389 (SCC), [1997] 1\nS.C.R. 948, at paras. 14-17; R. v. Shropshire, 1995 CanLII 47 (SCC), [1995] 4 S.C.R. 227).As\nLaskin J.A. explained in R. v. McKnight (1999), 1999 CanLII 3717 (ON CA), 135 C.C.C. (3d) 41 (Ont.\nC.A.), at para. 35, however, this does not mean that appellate courts can\ninterfere with a sentence simply because they would have weighed the relevant\nfactors differently:To suggest that a trial judge\ncommits an error in principle because in an appellate court’s opinion the trial\njudge gave too much weight to one relevant factor or not enough weight to\nanother is to abandon deference altogether.The weighing of relevant factors,\nthe balancing process is what the exercise of discretion is all about.To\nmaintain deference to the trial judge’s exercise of discretion, the weighing or\nbalancing of relevant factors must be assessed against the reasonableness standard\nof review.Only if by emphasizing one factor or by not giving enough weight to\nanother, the trial judge exercises his or her discretion unreasonably should an\nappellate court interfere with the sentence on the ground the trial judge erred\nin principle.[51]Here, the sentence was the product of a joint\nsubmission.Is the standard of review different when a sentence is imposed in\nthat circumstance?In R. v. A.N., 2011 NSCA 21 (CanLII), where there had been a\njoint recommendation, this Court accepted the same approach:[16]The parties agree to the\nstandard of review stated by Justice Saunders in R. v. Knockwood, 2009\nNSCA 98 (CanLII):[11] There is no\ndispute as to the proper standard of review in this case. This Court's review\nof a sentencing order is a highly respectful one. We must show great deference\nwhenever we are asked to consider appeals against sentence. Absent an error in\nprinciple, a failure to consider a relevant factor, or an over-emphasis of\nappropriate factors, we should only vary a sentence imposed at trial if we are\nconvinced that the sentence is demonstrably unfit. See for example, R. v.\nL.M., 2008 SCC 31 (CanLII); R. v. M.(C.A.), 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500; R. v.\nLongaphy, 2000 NSCA 136 (CanLII) and R. v. Conway, 2009 NSCA 95 (CanLII).See also R. v. Solowan,\n2008 SCC 62 (CanLII), [2008] 3 S.C.R. 309, para. 16 and R. v. McDonnell, 1997 CanLII 389 (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 948,\nparas. 15-17. Similarly, in R. v. Markie, 2009 NSCA 119 (CanLII), Justice\nHamilton said:[11] The parties agree\nthe standard of review is one of deference as set out in R. v. Longaphy,\n2000 NSCA 136 (CanLII):20A\nsentence imposed by a trial judge is entitled to considerable deference from an\nappellate court. A sentence should only be varied if the appellate court is\nsatisfied that the sentence under review is \"clearly unreasonable\": R.\nv. Shropshire (1995), 1995 CanLII 47 (SCC), 102 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (S.C.C.) at pp. 209-210. Absent\nan error in principle, failure to consider a relevant factor, or an\noveremphasis of the appropriate factors, a court of appeal should only\nintervene to vary a sentence if the sentence is \"demonstrably unfit\":\nR. v. M.(C.A.) (1996), 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), 105 C.C.C. (3d) 327 (S.C.C.) at p. 374.See also R. v. Starratt, 2007 NSCA\n21 (CanLII) and R. v. Markie, 2009 NSCA 119 (CanLII); both appeals of joint submissions\nwherein the court relied upon Longaphy.[52]I observe that none of the appellants in A.N.,\nMarkie or Starratt complained that the jointly recommended\nsentence was unfit, as does Mr. Marriott in this appeal.In those three\ndecisions, as in the vast majority of appeals of joint recommendation, the\njudge rejected the joint recommendation.[53]However, on an appeal taken against sentence, s.\n687 of the Criminal Code requires this court to “consider the fitness of\nthe sentence appealed against”.Whether or not the sentence was imposed\npursuant to a joint recommendation, the analysis will include a determination\nof whether the judge made any error in principle and whether the sentence was\ndemonstrably unfit.[54]Neither the Supreme Court of Canada, nor any\nCanadian appellate court, has closely examined whether the standard of review\nchanges depending on whether there is a joint recommendation.In R. v. Levesque,\n2012 ONCA 231 (CanLII) at ¶ 1, the Ontario Court of Appeal declined to address the\nissue.[55]It may be that the standard on review on an\nappeal from sentence imposed pursuant to a joint recommendation accepted by the\njudge and, particularly where there is no allegation of ineffective assistance\nof counsel such that the plea bargain amounted to a miscarriage of justice,\nshould attract different or a higher level of defence.This is not the case\nfor determining this issue.Counsel did not raise the matter.Moreover, it is\nnot necessary for the determination of this appeal.For this appeal, I will\ngive the same level of deference and adopts the same principles as for an\nappeal of any sentence.(b)Demonstrably Unfit Sentence[56]In arguing that his sentence was demonstrably\nunfit, Mr. Marriott raised a number of matters.These included submissions\npertaining to alleged errors in the Agreed Statement of Facts the Crown\npresented to the sentencing judge.According to the appellant, he had not\nhad the requisite intent for attempted murder, the offence for which he had\nbeen sentenced.He also suggested that his having been ordered to shoot the\nvictim and his having acted in self-defence were overlooked.He argued that\nthe judge failed to consider parity and proportionality, and to give him credit\nfor time in remand.(i)The Agreed Statement of Facts[57]In his summary factum, the appellant argues that\nhe received double the sentence of two co-accused he describes as the “actual .\n. . perpetrators” of the shooting “because the Crown selected the facts they\nwanted the Court to hear.”He maintains that the Crown forced his trial\ncounsel to accept the sentence and no credit for remand, was late providing the\nAgreed Statement of Facts to his trial counsel and the court, his counsel had\ninsufficient time to review it, he himself had never seen it, and the judge had\nnot read it thoroughly before the sentencing proceeding.[58]As indicated earlier, Mr. Marriott does not\nsuggest that Mr. Burke, acknowledged to be a very experienced criminal lawyer,\nwas ineffective.Rather, on multiple occasions, he emphasized that ineffective\nassistance of counsel was not a ground of appeal.What he says in\nclaiming that the actions of the state resulted in a demonstrably unfit\nsentence is that his counsel was overcome by the hard position taken by the\nCrown in its negotiations, which resulted in the joint recommendation of 15\nyears imprisonment.[59]With respect, I see nothing in the record that\nsupports the appellant’s argument in this regard.Rather, the evidence before\nme is to the contrary.[60]In his testimony, Mr. Burke stated that there\nwere three separate instances where Mr. Marriott was alleged to have attempted\nto murder Mr. Hallett.He was the appellant’s counsel at two preliminary\ninquiries which the appellant attended.As to the facts presented by the Crown\nand whether he was disadvantaged by its late filing or coerced into agreement\nwith the Crown’s position, Mr. Burke testified under cross-examination by the\nCrown:...Mr. Scott:Did you ever have any misunderstandings\nor did you ever perceive any misunderstandings from Mr. Marriott about what the\nCrown’s allegations were in this case?Mr. Burke:No the, at the conclusion of the\npreliminary inquiry, I met with Mr. Marriott and discussed the evidence,\ndiscussed the I guess the possibility of him giving evidence on his own behalf\nin respect to one or more of these charges.I received his advice with respect\nto his taking the stand.I then discussed it further with him that if indeed\nthe Crown were to lay the evidence before a court in the absence of any\ncontradictory evidence what the probable outcome could be.Especially when we\nwere carrying two additional attempt murder charges which was always first and\nforemost in our discussions.Mr. Scott:Okay.Mr. Burke:As, it was very clear that Mr. Marriott\nwas facing three separate incidents where the allegation is he attempted to\nmurder this particular fellow....Mr. Scott:Okay.And was there anything about those\nfacts that took you by surprise in light of how the prosecution had advanced at\nthat point?Mr. Burke:No, I did recall that the brief came in\nlate.I do recall reviewing the facts in the brief.Mr. Scott:Um humMr. Burke:I do not recall any facts that were in\nthe brief that I was unfamiliar with or that I took issue with.Mr. Scott:Okay.Mr. Burke:And, if there had been, okay, the matter\nwould not have proceeded butMr. Scott:Sorry, can you elaborate on that please?Mr. Burke:Well obviously if I took issue with the\nfact in the Crown’s brief, I would ask that the matter be adjourned especially\ngiven the lateness of the delivery of the Crown’s brief.Mr. Scott:Okay.Mr. Burke:Consequently, I would check with my\nclient, that if I had a problem with facts then that he may have a problem with\nthe facts as well.So consequently, and my client and I had talked about the\nfacts at length and I think he was quite familiar with them, as was I.Mr. Scott:Alright.Mr. Burke:And so consequently, I had no issue with\nthe facts and the matter proceeding.Mr. Scott:Alright.Did the timing of when you\nreceived the Crown brief in any way prevent you from representing your client\non the 16th of May at the sentencing hearing?Mr. Burke:No.Mr. Scott:Did you feel like you were being bullied\nby the Crown in agreeing with the facts by receiving at that time?Mr. Burke:Was I bullied?Mr. Scott:Bullied.Mr. Burke:No.No.I know that if indeed I had\ntaken issue with the any of the facts there that it would have been appropriate\nto have the matter adjourned until such time as that matter got resolved.[61]In his cross-examination of Mr. Burke, the Crown\nreferred to the sentencing hearing and the recess requested by Mr. Marriott\nbefore he addressed the court.The recess lasted about an hour, after which\nthe appellant rose in court and took full responsibility for shooting Mr.\nHallett.He apologized not only to the public and his family, but also to\nMessrs. LeBlanc and Murphy whom he described as “completely innocent.”[62]Mr. Burke confirmed that he did not meet Mr.\nMarriott during the recess.The cross-examination continued:Mr. Scott:Okay.At any point did Mr. Marriott at\nthis time indicate any disagreement with facts that were either related by the\nCrownMr. Burke:No.Mr. Scott:or you?Okay.I’m sorry, just\nwondering if you can verbalize that for the record.Mr. Burke:No, he did not express any disagreement\nto me at any time as to the facts that had been outlined....Mr. Scott:Okay.And can you indicate to the court\nwhether Mr. Marriott ever instructed you to plea enter a guilty plea on his\nbehalf on any facts other than those alleged by the Crown?Mr. Burke:No.[63]Mr. Marriott’s counsel then questioned Mr.\nBurke.Asked by Ms. Cooper what opportunity he had had to explore the salient\nfacts, Mr. Burke specifically recalled a meeting with the Crown prosecutor that\n“involved a great deal of discussion about the facts”.He continued:Mr. Burke:… I was familiar with the facts as there\nwas a fair bit of evidence given at the preliminary about what indeed happened\nthat evening.In addition, there were video that was watched, there was audio,\nand that that‘s why quite frankly when I received the facts they basically\nconfirmed what I had known for sometime as to the details of what what occurred\nthat particular evening.Ms. Cooper:Right, but due toMr. Burke:It wasn’t surprising.She never\nprovided those facts to me a week or a month before.I grant you that and I\ndon’t take issue with that.She was late in getting that to me.It was a\njoint recommendation which you know was being put to the court and given that\nit was a joint recommendation and that I wasn’t arguing sentence, I wouldn‘t\nhave had the same concerns say that if I had if we were arguing sentence and\nthere were issues with respect to the facts that could affect the sentence.Obviously if you are arguing sentence, the facts become a much greater issue in\nthe court and between counsel.[64]Mr. Burke gave his evidence in a straightforward\nand candid manner.His testimony makes it clear that, despite its late filing,\nhe had had sufficient time to review the Crown’s brief.Moreover, the Crown’s\nhard bargaining had not forced him into any corner.Had he thought that any facts\nthe Crown recounted were improper, Mr. Burke was prepared to seek an\nadjournment.He was obviously startled by the suggestion that he might have\nbeen bullied by the Crown into accepting incorrect facts.His then client\nnever indicated either during the sentencing proceeding or during the hour long\nrecess that there was any problem whatsoever with any of the facts.Mr. Burke\ntestified that he was “quite surprised” when Mr. Marriott addressed the court, and\nthat he had not had any discussions with him about the version of events that\nhe gave at that time.[65]In his evidence, Mr. Marriott deposed and\ntestified that he had never seen the Crown’s Agreed Statement of Facts and had\nhad no opportunity to review its brief.But it is uncontested that the appellant\nhad attended the preliminary inquiries pursuant to the charges which alleged several\nattempts to shoot Mr. Hallett; he heard the Crown’s case against him.Moreover, it was not disputed that he had had discussions with his trial\ncounsel.Mr. Burke testified that after those preliminary inquiries, he had\ndiscussed the evidence against the appellant with him.In his submissions at\nthe sentencing hearing, trial counsel also spoke of “extensive discussions with\nmy client” before the joint sentence recommendation was reached.[66]In one of his briefs, Mr. Marriott argued that\nthe sentence to which the Crown and his trial counsel agreed, was not\ncommunicated to him until just the day before he pled guilty to the offence.But\nunder cross-examination at the hearing of the appeal, Mr. Burke testified:Mr. Burke:...But in this particular case, the\nelephant that was in the room at all times were these two other charges.Obviously that was of great concern to me, it was of great concern to my client\nand we had you know, the Crown and I had great discussions about the three\ncharges.My client and I had great discussion about the three charges.Consequently, when I spoke to Mr. Marriott about the bottom line for the Crown,\nit was then and it’s still is my practice that when I seek a final decision\nfrom my client, I essentially ask him to think about it.Normally, I would go\nover on a Friday or I would go over on a Thursday and I’d basically say to him,\ndon’t give me an answer now, think about it, take your time, I’m not rushing\nyou with respect to making a decision.And that’s what I did here. The next\nmeeting that I had with Mr. Marriott, I recall, was that he told me that he was\naccepting it, that he had discussed it fully with his family, that he wanted to\nget on with his life, and consequently he was going to proceed in the manner\nthat had been outlined by the Crown.[67]In view of the evidence from the appellant and\nhis trial counsel regarding the appellant’s attendance at the preliminary\ninquiries and their discussions regarding the evidence, I am satisfied that even\nif he had not received a hard copy of the Crown’s brief and reviewed it, Mr.\nMarriott understood the case against him on the charge of attempted murder and\nthe facts upon which the Crown would be relying.(ii)Mitigating Factors[68]There was no pre-sentence report and the Crown’s\nbrief to the sentencing judge did state that there was “a complete absence of\nmitigating factors”.The appellant argues that “he was left in the cold with\nnothing said about him”.In particular, he alleges a dearth of information\nabout his background, and a misunderstanding of his criminal record.He says\nthat at the time of the offence he was not in school, was unemployed and had no\nhome, but was highly intelligent and showed potential.According to the\nappellant, none of this information was presented to the judge who consequently\ndid not take it into account.[69]The record shows that both counsel advised the\ncourt that Mr. Marriott was 20 when sentenced.In his submissions, Mr. Burke\nbrought a number of circumstances to the judge’s attention.He pointed out\nthat the victim of the shooting, Mr. Hallett, had himself been carrying a\nloaded handgun at the time and asked that these “special circumstances” as they\nrelate to the victim be taken into consideration.He stated that the appellant\nhad had “a rough history”, “a rough upbringing”, not through any fault of his\nparents, but because of the environment where he comes from and the people he\nhangs around with.He also advised that, while in pre-trial custody, the\nappellant had completed his high school equivalency, had taken the initiative\nto find out how to enroll and did enroll at Acadia University, and had scored\n92.5 percent on the written portion of the one course he had completed.Trial\ncounsel pointed out that the appellant had taken it upon himself to try and\nchange his life.[70]The records shows that the appellant’s claim\nthat information about him was omitted is not well-founded.The sentencing\njudge was alerted to many of the appellant’s circumstances through the oral\nsubmissions.Any that remained missing were not before him because Mr. Burke\ndid not raise them in his oral submissions, or call for the preparation of an\nupdated pre-sentence report.In the absence of any claim of ineffective\nassistance of counsel, I cannot accept the appellant’s argument.(iii)Criminal Record[71]At the sentencing hearing, the Crown reported\nthat Mr. Marriott had 22 prior convictions, all within the previous seven\nyears, and he had committed all of them except one while a youth.According to\nthe Crown, his record included “crimes of violence, weapons offences and drug\ntrafficking”.On appeal, the appellant objects to this characterization of his\ncriminal record.In his affidavit evidence, he dismissed his criminal record as\none which merely “consists of school yard quarrels including one where I used a\njack knife and one where I took a bank card but returned it to the boy I took\nit from.”[72]On cross-examination, the appellant acknowledged\nthat in September 2005, he had pepper-sprayed a man who tried to retrieve his\nboy’s bicycle which Mr. Marriott had taken.He agreed that that was not a\nschool yard situation.He also admitted that in December 2005, when he robbed\nsomeone of his bank card and cell phone near Pizza Corner, he had stabbed the\nperson he robbed.He agreed that that was not a school yard quarrel either.[73]In my view, in the face of his own concessions, Mr.\nMarriott’s suggestion that the Crown incorrectly described his record as\nincluding matters more serious than “school yard quarrels” cannot be sustained.(iv)Intent to Kill[74]Under cross-examination of his affidavit\nevidence, Mr. Marriott confirmed that he had plead guilty to attempted murder, which\nhe knew was a serious charge.However, asked whether he had understood that\nintent to kill was an essential element of attempted murder, he answered:“I\ndidn’t have intent to kill on my mind.Like I didn’t have murder on my mind\nbut firing a gun.I took responsibility for the charge and plead guilty\nbecause I did fire the gun.”The appellant confirmed that he knew that the\nCrown’s allegation was that he and three others had intended to kill Mr.\nHallett that evening, and that he understood that first degree murder involved\nplanning and deliberation.But he maintained that he had not had the specific\nintent to kill when he fired, and the shot was not directed at anyone.He had\nsimply plead guilty because he was the shooter; that is, for firing the gun.[75]The Crown questioned Mr. Burke on the mental\nelement required for attempted murder.He confirmed his familiarity with it,\nand added that he had discussed intent with the appellant in the context of a\ncase where it was alleged that Mr. Marriott had pointed and attempted to fire a\ngun at someone, but the weapon was inoperable.His evidence continued:Mr.\nScott:Mr. Marriott had testified this morning\nthat he did not intend to kill Jason Hallett at the IWK.Can you indicate\nwhether that was ever discussed between yourself and Mr. Hallett, Mr. Marriott?Mr.\nBurke:No.That he, he didn’t intend to kill him?Mr.\nScott:Yeah.Mr.\nBurke:No.Mr.\nScott:Okay.Do youMr.\nBurke:I’m sorry, I don’t understand what you mean\nby that.Mr.\nScott:Well he said that he went there and shot at\nhim with a gun but didn’t intend to kill him, just wanted to hurt him.Did you\nhave any discussion with Mr. Marriott about that as the basis for attempted\nmurder guilty plea?Mr.\nBurke:No.Mr.\nScott:Would you have advised him to plead guilty\nif that were the fact, that he was …Mr.\nBurke:Well, if Mr. Marriott had put that\nproposition to me what I would have done would be to sit down and discuss the\ncase with him.[76]Mr. Burke’s reaction to this questioning on\nintent to kill was one of surprise.I accept trial counsel’s evidence that he\nwent over the elements of attempted murder with his former client.Having\nwatched and heard Mr. Marriott testify, I would describe him as intelligent,\narticulate and combative.He withstood questioning without being intimidated.The appellant was originally charged with more than one count of attempted\nmurder, and attended more than one preliminary inquiry in relation to major\ncriminal charges.That such a forthright individual, faced with very serious\nconsequences if found guilty, never thought to mention to his counsel that he\ndid not mean to kill anyone, strikes me as preposterous.That the appellant\nwould make this submission yet, at the same time, not claim ineffective\nassistance of counsel because his lawyer had not recognized or raised the\nrequisite intent with him, only emphasizes how disingenuous his argument is.(v)Self Defence[77]Mr. Marriott also suggested that, in shooting\nMr. Hallett, he had been provoked or had acted in self-defence.He did not raise\nthis in earlier proceedings where it would have operated as a complete defence\nto the charge of attempted murder.Since self-defence does not act as a\nmitigating factor affecting the fitness of the sentence, it is a bit strange\nthat this is being put forward in an appeal of sentence only.In any event,\nthe appellant’s submission is largely based on a Continuation Report written by\nCst. Kirton.In that document, the officer commented that Mr. Marriott was\nviewed shuffling his feet back “believed to be a result of Jason HALLETT\npointing his gun”.The appellant also says that the fact that the driver of\nthe Cherokee, in which Mr. Hallett was seated, left the vehicle before the\nshooting rather than drive away, and Mr. Hallett’s statement that he had a loaded\ngun and watched the appellant approach, suggest that Mr. Hallett was the\ninstigator of the shooting.[78]In his affidavit filed on this appeal, Cst.\nKirton deposed:6.I\nam the author of a Continuation Report wherein I viewed the security footage\nand observed Aaron Marriott approach the vehicle in which Jason Hallett was\nsitting, and observed Mr. Marriott fire a gun towards that vehicle numerous\ntimes.7.I\nobserved Mr. Marriott’s feet shuffling, or stance change while he was firing\ntowards the vehicle.8.My\ncomment that Mr. Hallett may have had a gun pointed at Mr. Marriott was based\npurely on speculation, wondering what may have caused Mr. Marriott to shuffle\nhis feet, or change his stance, in the manner that he did.9.There\nwas no evidence within our investigation to suggest that Mr. Hallett, in fact,\npointed his gun at Mr. Marriott at any time.[79]Under cross-examination, Cst. Kirton described\nhis suggestion that Mr. Hallett may have pointed a gun at the appellant as\n“speculation”.The appellant’s affidavit evidence did not address self-defence,\nand he did not give any testimony in support of this claim.In my view, the\nofficer’s affidavit and oral evidence are far from sufficient to establish that\nMr. Hallett pointed or started to raise his gun at Mr. Marriott.The driver\ncould have left the car for any number of reasons and neither that person nor\nMr. Hallett testified as to whether the latter or the appellant was the first\nto raise his weapon.I have no evidentiary foundation for finding that Mr. Marriott\nshot Mr. Hallett, in self-defence or because of any action on Mr. Hallett’s\npart.(vi)Resources of the State[80]According to the appellant, the state used\nunprecedented resources to arrest him and to make a case against him.In this\nregard, he points to an article in the local Chronicle Herald newspaper quoting\nthe Police Chief as saying at an earlier news conference that the force was\n“pulling out all the stops to arrest the gunmen” and “were going to put\nunprecedented resources into this”.The article also quoted an officer saying\nthat “[t]his (arrest) [of the appellant] is a result of those unprecedented\nresources.”With respect, assuming this material was admissible, I do not\nunderstand how swift and substantial efforts by the police to capture those\nresponsible for a shooting adjacent to a children’s hospital which alarmed the\npublic would reduce the appellant’s culpability or sentence.[81]The appellant also claims that the state used\nits:“unprecedented resources … to\nobtain the evidence of a known, drug addicted, cocaine trafficker [Mr. Hallett],\nto frame a kid [Mr. Marriott], and put him away for life, and completely\nignoring the criminality of the other criminal, rewarding him and giving him\nthe opportunity for a new life”He argues that initially Mr. Hallett had\nbeen reluctant to co-operate with the police and only did so after being induced\nby promises and threats.Mr. Hallett’s credibility would have or could have\nbeen tested at the preliminary inquiry by cross-examination by the appellant’s\ntrial counsel.There is no claim of ineffective assistance here.This\ncomplaint of unprecedented resources being used to “frame” the appellant is\noverstated.(vii)Wiretap Evidence[82]The applicant submits that the wiretap evidence\nof the calls exchanged with an individual at the hospital and then Messrs.\nLeBlanc and Murphy in one vehicle, and Messrs. Smith and Marriott in the other,\nbefore and at the time of the shooting, was illegal.He says that the\nauthorization for the wiretaps was backdated to the date of the offence and\nthat he should benefit from any doubt as to the actual date on which they were\nlegally authorized.[83]The fresh evidence the appellant submitted on\nappeal included what purported to be the final page of the authorization for\nthe wiretap evidence in the case.The last line as typed read “DATED at\nHalifax Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia, this 19th day of\nNovember, 2008”.The “19th” had been crossed out and “18th”\nhand-written above it.[84]Assuming that this evidence is admissible, it is\nnot so unequivocal as to persuade me that improper motives can be ascribed to\nthe change.For example, it is possible that the document was issued on the 18th,\nthe typed dated was wrong and simply corrected by the judge who signed the\nauthorization and initialled the new date.(viii)Directed to Shoot[85]Mr. Marriott also submitted that certain circumstances\nunder which he shot Mr. Hallett were not emphasized when he was sentenced.This argument is based on the evidence of the telephone calls intercepted by\nthe police, and assumes the validity of the wiretap evidence.When the\nlocation of the Cherokee in which Mr. Hallett was seated was identified in the\nhospital parking lot, Mr. Smith told the appellant to “get out and blaze that\nCherokee.”Mr. Marriott then proceeded to walk up to that vehicle and fire\nseveral shots from a handgun at Mr. Hallett.[86]However, his evidence under cross-examination at\nthe hearing of his appeal does not support the suggestion that Mr. Marriott\nfelt compelled by Mr. Smith’s words to shoot.The appellant confirmed that the\nCrown’s allegation throughout was that he and Messrs. Smith, LeBlanc and Murphy\ncoordinated their efforts to find where Mr. Hallett was so that he could shoot\nhim.The exchange continued:Mr. Scott:… Are you saying that you acted alone when it came to this\nshooting of Mr. Hallett?Mr. Marriott:To an extent, yes.Mr. Scott:What do you mean to an extent?Mr. Marriott:I have to take responsibility for what I did.I fired the gun.I\ncan’t blame anyone else for that.. . .Mr. Scott:And were you directed by anyone else to do so?Mr. Marriott:No, I basically have to listen to myself kind of thing.I don’t\nknow.Mr. Scott:No one told you to shoot at Mr. Hallett?Mr. Marriott:Not to my knowledge, some things happened so fast, one after\nanother, I don’t really recall.. . .Mr. Scott:And you stated to Judge Coady when you were being sentenced that\nyou acted alone, right?You stated to him, you didn’t even know what you’re\ngoing to do until you’d gotten out of the car and was walking towards Mr.\nHallett.Mr. Marriott:That’s true.Mr. Scott:That’s true?And that’s the basis on which you pleaded guilty to\nattempted murder?Mr. Marriott:On the basis that I did fire the gun at Mr. Hallett in his wrist.So, I plead guilty to attempted murder.. . .Mr. Scott:You’re in the car with Smith, right?Mr. Marriott:Yes.Mr. Scott:You didn’t have to talk with him on the phone, did you?Mr. Marriott:No.Mr. Scott:And he’s saying blaze the Cherokee, right?Mr. Marriott:I just don’t recall the conversations and everything.At the\nnight, like it happened so fast, like . . .[87]The appellant’s evidence was either that no one\ntold him to shoot Mr. Hallett, or that he didn’t recall because things happened\nso fast that night.This undermines his argument that it was Mr. Smith who\ndirected him to shoot and that he, a naïve young man with no criminal record\nother than “school yard quarrels” simply followed instructions.Moreover, his\naddress to the judge at his sentencing hearing wherein the appellant stated\nthat he himself did not know what he was going to do as he got out of the car\nand walked towards the vehicle in which Mr. Hallett was seated, is contrary to\nhis position.(ix)Remand Credit[88]Mr. Marriott argues that the judge erred by not\nreducing his sentence to take into account the 2.4 years he spent in custody.He submits that not only should he have received a 2:1 remand credit but,\nbecause of state misconduct and the time he spent in segregation, further\nenhanced or increased credit.[89]The appellant was charged in 2008 prior to the\nenactment of the Truth in Sentencing Act, S.C. 2009, c. 29.At that\ntime, s. 719(3) of the Criminal Code provided that the sentencing judge\n“may take into account any time spent in custody by the person as a result of\nthe offence”.While a 2:1 credit for time spent in remand was common practice,\nvarious considerations could result in a variation or denial of credit:see,\nfor example, R. v. LeBlanc, 2011 NSCA 60 (CanLII) at ¶ 21-22.A 2:1 credit was\nnot a mechanical formula, but it was “entirely appropriate” and remained\ndiscretionary:R. v. Wust, 2000 SCC 18 (CanLII) at ¶ 44-45, and R. v. A.N.,\n2011 NSCA 21 (CanLII) at ¶ 41.The sentencing judge’s exercise of that discretion was\nrequired to be done on a principled basis:A.N. at ¶ 40.Since remand\ncredit is discretionary pursuant to s. 719(3), appellant intervention is only\nwarranted where an error in principle or palpable and overriding error has been\nshown.[90]Citing Nasogaluak, the appellant says\nthat the judge should have exercised his discretion and given him even more\nthan the 2:1 credit because of the misconduct of the state which he says\nincluded:(i)selecting one criminal\nover the other to take the wrap (sic), and ignoring the criminality of Mr.\nHallett,[ii]the arbitrary treatment\nand cruel and unusual punishment, to which the Appellant was subject, at the\nhands of the authorities, in the prisons in which he was incarcerated, contrary\nto their own rules.[iii]the actions of the Crown,\nin seeking this grossly excessive sentence on the Appellant.As explained earlier, these allegations of\nstate misconduct have not been substantiated so there is no basis for such\nfurther enhancement of any remand credit.[91]As for any enhanced credit because of\nsegregation, this has been rejected or accepted based on the particular facts\nof the case.In R. v. Nehass, 2010 YKTC 64 (CanLII) at ¶ 12, where segregation\nhad been required to manage the aboriginal offender’s oppositional behaviour\nwhile in custody – he was being sentenced for twice assaulting police officers\nin the correctional centre – it was rejected.Segregation did result in a\ncredit in R. v. Sakebow, 2012 SKQB 81 (CanLII), where the accused, a long-term\noffender, was placed in segregation because of information that his life and\nsafety would be threatened if placed in the general population.At ¶ 38, the\njudge found that as it was not the accused’s conduct that resulted in\nsegregation, he was entitled to an increased credit for that time.In R. v.\nC.L., 2012 ONCA 835 (CanLII), the appellant who had been held in administrative\nsegregation for the 18 month pre-trial period, spending 23 hours a day in his\ncell, argued that the judge failed to attach sufficient weight to his harsh\nsegregation conditions in giving him only 1:1 credit.The Court of Appeal\ndetermined that the judge acted within his discretion, and considered the\nadministrative segregation conditions but also other factors that weighed\nagainst enhanced credit such as the appellant’s outstanding charges and having\nbeen on bail when he committed the offences for which he was charged.[92]Here, the segregation for which the appellant\nclaims the judge should have given him remand credit was for disciplinary\npurposes, arising from his misconduct or, he claims, that of others.In such\ncircumstances, the judge would not have erred by exercising his discretion and\ndenying any credit.[93]I would add that the judge was made very aware\nthat the jointly submitted sentence of 15 years included some two and one-half\nyears of remand time.The Crown reiterated this in its closing comments.In\nhis submissions at trial, Mr. Burke spoke of “extensive discussions” “ongoing\nfor some considerable period of time” and “extensive discussions with the\nCrown, as well, extensive discussions with my client, before an agreement was\nreached”.Mr. Burke also spoke of factors including the strength of the Crown’s\ncase for this incident and others before the Court.He then addressed the 15\nyear sentence commencing that day, which recognized or included the appellant’s\n29 months in pre-trial custody.In these circumstances, where remand time had\nbeen taken into account and ineffective assistance of counsel has not been\nargued, it is difficult to say that the judge erred in not granting remand\ntime.(x)Proportionality[94]Mr. Marriott argues that he was sentenced as\nthough he was the sole perpetrator of the offence, without regard to the roles\nof the other participants, and that his sentence was not proportional to that\nof the others.He points out that he plead guilty to attempted murder and was\nsentenced to 15 years on a go forward basis and that the sentences received by\nthe other three co-accused were lighter.Those men were sentenced by the same\njudge, after Mr. Marriott was.Their sentences were as follows:(a)Matthew\nMurphy was tried and sentenced to five years for attempted murder and\nconspiracy to commit murder, to be served concurrently:R. v. Murphy, 2011\nNSSC 410 (CanLII).His appeal to this court was dismissed by a majority:2012 NSCA 92 (CanLII);\nhis appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed:2013 SCC 21 (CanLII).(b)Shaun Ryan\nSmith who plead guilty to conspiracy to commit murder, was sentenced to ten\nyears, less credit for 27 months spent in pre-trial custody, for a sentence of seven\nyears, nine months on a go forward basis, 2011 NSSC 413 (CanLII); and(c)Jeremy\nLeBlanc was tried and sentenced to ten years for attempted murder and\nconspiracy to commit murder, to be served concurrently.He had no pre-trial custody\ncredit available, 2011 NSSC 412 (CanLII).[95]I will address the appellant’s various arguments\nby:(a)reviewing how a judge is to proceed when presented with a\njoint submission on sentence;(b)considering\nwhat the judge did in this case; and(c)considering\nthe principles of parity and proportionality.[96]It is useful here to recount that the appellant\nplead guilty to attempted murder, pursuant to s. 239(1)(a.1) of the Criminal\nCode which stipulates a minimum sentence of four years and a maximum of\nlife imprisonment.While these are the outer limits of the punishment, they do\nnot necessarily denote the range of sentence.In R. v. E.M.W., 2011\nNSCA 87 (CanLII), Fichaud, J.A. discussed the meaning of range and the principle of\nproportionality:[29]The statutory maximum term of imprisonment for an offence under s. 271 of the Code\nis ten years.But that does not mean the effective “range” for parity purposes\nin E.M.W.’s sentencing has a ceiling of ten years.In R. v. Cromwell,\n2005 NSCA 137 (CanLII), [2005] N.S.J. No. 428 (C.A.), para 26, Justice Bateman discussed the meaning of\n“the range”:[Counsel]\nbroadly defines the range of sentence, in these circumstances, as all sentences\nthat might be imposed for the crime of impaired driving causing bodily harm.I\ndisagree.In my opinion the range is not the minimum to maximum possibilities\nfor the offence but is narrowed by the context of the offence committed and the\ncircumstances of the offender (“... sentences imposed upon similar offenders\nfor similar offences committed in similar circumstances ...” per MacEachern,\nC.J.B.C. in R. v. Mafi (2000), 2000 BCCA 135 (CanLII), 142 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (C.A.)).The actual\npunishment may vary on a continuum taking into account aggravating and\nmitigating factors, the remedial focus required for the particular offender and\nthe need to protect the public.This variation creates the range.To\nsimilar effect R. v. A.N., 2011 NSCA 21 (CanLII), para 34:Unless expressed in the Code,\nthere is no universal range with fixed boundaries for all instances of an\noffence: R. v. M.(C.A.), para. 92; R. v. McDonnell (1997 CanLII 389 (SCC), [1997] 1\nS.C.R. 948), para. 16; R. v. L.M., para. 36.The range moves\nsympathetically with the circumstances, and is proportionate to the Code’s\nsentencing principles that include fundamentally the offence’s gravity and the\noffender’s culpability.[97]The law is clear that, outside of the joint\nrecommendation context, sentences falling outside of the range of appropriate\nsentences are not necessarily unfit.In Nasogaluak, the Supreme Court\nof Canada stated:[44]The wide discretion granted\nto sentencing judges has limits.It is fettered in part by the case law that\nhas set down, in some circumstances, general ranges of sentences for particular\noffences, to encourage greater consistency between sentencing decisions in\naccordance with the principle of parity enshrined in the Code.But it\nmust be remembered that, while courts should pay heed to these ranges, they are\nguidelines rather than hard and fast rules.A judge can order a sentence\noutside that range as long as it is in accordance with the principles and\nobjectives of sentencing. Thus, a sentence falling outside the regular range of\nappropriate sentences is not necessarily unfit.Regard must be had to all the\ncircumstances of the offence and the offender, and to the needs of the community\nin which the offence occurred.[98]This same reasoning has been applied to joint\nsubmissions.In R. v. Oxford, 2010 NLCA 45 (CanLII) the Newfoundland Court of\nAppeal stated:76If, therefore, a sentence not involving a joint submission and\nfalling outside the regular range of appropriate sentences is not necessarily\nan unfit sentence, then a fortiori a jointly-submitted sentence will not\nnecessarily be unfit and certainly will not bring the administration of justice\ninto disrepute simply by virtue of the fact that it falls outside the normal\nrange.Accordingly, sentences imposed by way of joint\nrecommendations which fall outside the range are not necessarily unfit.[99]I turn then to how a judge is to proceed when\ncounsel present a joint recommendation.In R. v. MacIvor, 2003 NSCA 60 (CanLII),\nCromwell, J.A. (as he then was) provided this guidance:[31]. . . It is not\ndoubted that a joint submission resulting from a plea bargain while not binding\non the Court, should be given very serious consideration.This requires the\nsentencing judge to do more than assess whether it is a sentence he or she\nwould have imposed absent the joint submission: see, e.g., R. v. Thomas\n(2000), 2000 MBCA 148 (CanLII), 153 Man. R. (2d) 98 (C.A.) at para. 6.It requires the sentencing\njudge to assess whether the jointly submitted sentence is within an acceptable\nrange - in other words, whether it is a fit sentence. If it is, there must be\nsound reasons for departing from it: see, for example, R. v. MacDonald\n(2001), 2001 NSCA 26 (CanLII), 191 N.S.R. (2d) 399; N.S.J. 51 (Q.L.)(N.S.C.A.); R. v. Tkachuk\n(2001), 2001 ABCA 243 (CanLII), 159 C.C.C. (3d) 434 (Alta. C.A.) at para. 32; R. v. C.(G.W.)\n(2000), 2000 ABCA 333 (CanLII), 150 C.C.C. (3d) 513 at paras. 17-18; R. v. Bezdan, 2001 BCCA 215 (CanLII), [2001] B.C.J.\nNo. 808 (C.A.) at paras. 14-15; R. v. Thomas, supra, at paras. 5-6; R.\nv. B.(B.), 2002 Carswell NWT 17 (N.T.C.A.) at para. 3; R. v. Webster\n(2001), 2001 SKCA 72 (CanLII), 207 Sask. R. 257 (C.A.) at para. 7.[32]Even where the\nproposed sentence may appear to the judge to be outside an acceptable range,\nthe judge ought to give it serious consideration, bearing in mind that even\nwith all appropriate disclosure to the Court, there are practical constraints\non disclosure of important and legitimate factors which may have influenced the\njoint recommendation.[100]In R. v. Cromwell, 2005 NSCA 137 (CanLII), Bateman,\nJ.A. explained why a judge usually respects a joint recommendation as to\nsentence arising from a negotiated guilty plea and when a judge might depart\nfrom it:RESOLUTION AGEEMENTS[18]In R. v. MacIvor,\nthis Court approved with particular emphasis, the following comment by Fish,\nJ.A. (as he then was), writing for the Court in R. v. Douglas (2002),\n162 C.C.C. (3d) 37 (Que. C.A.):[51]....the\ninterests of justice are well served by the acceptance of a joint submission on\nsentence accompanied by a negotiated plea of guilty - - provided, of course,\nthat the sentence jointly proposed falls within the acceptable range and the\nplea is warranted by the facts admitted.[19]There are many situations\nin which it is in the public interest for Crown and defence counsel to enter\ninto negotiations which result in a guilty plea and a joint sentence\nrecommendation.There may be uncertainties in evidence which induce both\ncounsel to prefer a compromise.Avoidance of a trial may save substantial\npublic expense and spare prosecution witnesses the trauma of testifying.A\nnegotiated resolution, which shortens the time between the charging of the\noffence and disposition, protects the public from those who would re-offend\nwhile on pre-trial release and spares victims of crime the long ordeal of\nawaiting trial of the perpetrators.Offenders sometimes provide the police\nwith critical information leading to the solution of other crimes.This can\nserve as a quid pro quo for a sentence somewhat reduced from what would\notherwise be appropriate.Heavy criminal caseloads resulting in court backlogs\ncan also be alleviated through consensual resolution, in the proper\ncircumstances.Such resolutions are more likely to be achieved where it is\nprobable that the sentencing judge will accept the recommendation of counsel.[20]Joint sentence submissions\narising from a negotiated guilty plea are generally respected by the sentencing\njudge. Ultimately, however, the judge is the guardian of the public interest\nand must preserve the reputation of the administration of justice.Where the\nagreed resolution is contrary to the public interest, would bring the\nadministration of justice into disrepute or is otherwise unreasonable the judge\nretains the discretion to reject the joint submission (R. v. Cerasuolo\n(2001), 2001 CanLII 24172 (ON CA), 151 C.C.C. (3d) 445 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Dorsey (1999), 1999 CanLII 3759 (ON CA), 123 O.A.C.\n342 (C.A.); R. v. C. (G.W.) (2000), 2000 ABCA 333 (CanLII), 150 C.C.C.(3d) 513 (Alta. C.A.)).[21]A trial judge may\ndecline to give effect to a joint recommendation, not simply because she would\nhave imposed a more severe sanction, but where the sentence is clearly\nunreasonable and then, only if the judge is satisfied there are no other\ncompelling circumstances justifying, as in the public interest, a departure\nfrom an otherwise fit sentence.FITNESS OF SENTENCE[22]In R. v.\nShropshire 1995 CanLII 47 (SCC), [1995] 4 S.C.R. 227 an “unfit” sentence is described as one that\nis “clearly unreasonable” (at para. 46 per Iacobucci, J., for a\nunanimous Court), in other words, “clearly excessive or inadequate” (see also R.\nv. Muise (1995), 1994 CanLII 4074 (NS CA), 94 C.C.C. (3d) 119 (N.S.C.A.)).An unreasonable sentence\nis one falling outside the range (Shropshire at para. 50 and MacIvor,\nsupra at para. 31).[23]In evaluating a joint\nsubmission the judge must determine the acceptable range of sentence for the\noffence before the court.A fit sentence is one that falls within that range.Fixing the range requires a consideration of the general sentencing principles\nand, for purposes of this case, those of conditional sentencing.[24]Where there is a\njoint submission, the judge considers the record before him – the admitted\nfacts of the offence; information about the offender; the victim impact\nstatements and submissions of counsel.It is counsels’ obligation to provide\nsufficient detail to justify the joint submission. (R. v. G.P., supra at\npara. 20 and R. v. Douglas, supra at para. 45).There are occasions\nwhen all relevant factors prompting the joint submission cannot be disclosed to\nthe judge.The offender may have provided useful but confidential information\nabout other crimes, disclosure of which would endanger his safety or compromise\nan on-going investigation.For that reason, even where a joint submission\nfalls outside the range, it should be given serious consideration (McIvor,\nsupra at para. 37).[101]In Starratt, this Court adopted the\nprotocol set out in R. v. Sinclair, 2004 MBCA 48 (CanLII) which is consistent\nwith MacIvor and Cromwell.There, the Manitoba Court of Appeal\nin regard to joint submissions on sentence outside the range wrote:5If a sentence recommended by both counsel is outside the range of sentence\nestablished by precedent, then the sentencing judge need not follow the joint\nrecommendation. See R. v. Booh (I.) (2003), 170 Man.R. (2d) 249, 2003\nMBCA 16 (CanLII).6However,\neven in that situation, a sentencing judge should exercise caution before\nignoring a sentence carefully negotiated by experienced counsel. As stated by\nthe Nova Scotia Court of Appeal in R. v. MacIvor (2003), 176 C.C.C. (3d)\n420, 2003 NSCA 60 (CanLII) (at para. 32):Even where the proposed sentence\nmay appear to the judge to be outside an acceptable range, the judge ought to\ngive it serious consideration, bearing in mind that even with all appropriate\ndisclosure to the Court, there are practical constraints on disclosure of\nimportant and legitimate factors which may have influenced the joint\nrecommendation.[102]In summary, if a sentence recommended by both\ncounsel is outside the range of sentence, the judge should give the joint\nsubmission “serious consideration” (MacIvor) and “exercise caution\nbefore ignoring a sentence carefully negotiated by experienced counsel” (Sinclair).If the sentence is clearly unreasonable, the judge may only reject the joint\nsubmission if satisfied there are no other compelling circumstances justifying,\nas in the public interest, a departure from an otherwise fit sentence.[103]How did the sentencing judge in this case\nproceed?His decision began:I am\nfamiliar with the principles and objectives of sentencing as set out in the Criminal\nCode, and I’m not going to repeat them here. And I’m very familiar with the\nsimilar cases that have been provided to me by counsel that helped me determine\nif the joint recommendation is an appropriate recommendation. And I will say,\nafter consideration of those authorities, I have no difficulty accepting the\njoint recommendation of 15 years. I recognize that the law says I should accept\njoint recommendations unless I can articulate a good reason not to, and I have\nno hesitation in saying, in this case, that I have no such reason that I could\npossibly articulate.He accepted the Crown’s description of the\nappellant shooting Mr. Hallett as a “botched first degree murder”, and lamented\nthe situation of a young man firing multiple shots with a high-powered pistol\nin the middle of the parking lot of the local children’s hospital.[104]This is not a situation where the judge found\nany fault with the joint submission.Rather, after reviewing the statement of\nfacts in the Crown’s sentencing brief, hearing the submissions of the Crown and\nthe appellant’s trial counsel, and considering the case law, the sentencing\njudge here assessed whether the jointly submitted sentence was appropriate and\ndetermined that it was within an acceptable range.[105]The appellant submits that he did not give it\nthe requisite “serious consideration” .The judge did not read the Crown’s\nbrief before the hearing started.The transcript of the sentencing proceeding\nshows that at its outset the judge told the Crown that he had not had a chance\nto read her brief and that he would take time when submissions finished.After\nthe court recessed for an hour and after the appellant’s address to the judge\nbut before imposing sentence, the judge told the Crown:I just want to say, Ms. Smith,\nthat I had a chance to read your brief, I’m familiar with it.It was a quick\nread but, nonetheless, I did that.It was the sentencing judge who set the\nduration of the recess, and he confirmed that he had had sufficient time to\nappreciate the material before him.[106]There is nothing on the record that indicates\nthat the judge did not take into account the factors presented to him by\ncounsel in assessing sentence.Nor is there anything on the record that\nsupports the appellant’s claim that he was sentenced as though he was the sole\nperpetrator of the offence.The facts as presented by the Crown, and the\nsubmission the Crown and trial counsel made to the judge, all referred to the\ninvolvement and actions of the three other co-accused.[107]As explained earlier in my decision, none of the\nmatters raised by the appellant pursuant to his fresh evidence motions such as\nthe allegedly incorrect characterization of his criminal record or his (lack\nof) intent to commit attempted murder were substantiated.Accordingly, there\nwas nothing omitted or substantially incorrect in the material before the\nsentencing judge.[108]Since the judge did not reject the sentence jointly\nproposed by the Crown and trial counsel as outside the range and thus unfit, there\nwas no need for him to seek further submissions from counsel or to give cogent\nreasons for not accepting it:Sinclair at ¶ 17, as approved by this\nCourt in Starratt, at ¶ 12.[109]Mr. Marriott argues that his sentence lacked\nparity.Section 718.2(b) of the Criminal Code reads:Other\nSentencing Principles718.2A court that imposes a sentence shall also take into\nconsideration the following principles:…(b)a sentence should be similar\nto sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in\nsimilar circumstances;…As indicated earlier, his sentence was heavier\nthan the sentences later imposed on by his co-accused who received, for\nattempted murder and conspiracy, ten years concurrent (Mr. LeBlanc) and five\nyears concurrent (Mr. Murphy); and, for conspiracy to commit murder, ten years\n(Mr. Smith).What the appellant considers would be a fit sentence for himself\nis ten years, which he says should be reduced by a remand credit already\nreviewed.[110]The appellant’s parity argument assumes that,\nbecause all four accused were sentenced as a result of the same incident which\nculminated in the shooting of Mr. Hallett at the hospital, his sentence should\nbe calculated only with their sentences in mind.But what the parity principle\ncalls for is a consideration of sentences imposed on “similar offenders for\nsimilar offences committed in similar circumstances”.There is no constraint\nlimiting the comparable sentences to those of any co-accused.[111]Moreover, the appellant’s actions are\ndistinguishable from those of his co-accused.As he himself says, he was the\nshooter.It was the appellant who, loaded gun in hand, walked across the\nparking lot, stopped by the Cherokee, raised and pointed the gun at Mr.\nHallett, and fired it several times.It is an inescapable fact that the\nappellant shot another person in a public place.I have not accepted from the\nfresh evidence or his testimony on appeal that he did so without intent to kill\nor in self-defence or under some form of coercion.A person who commits\nattempted murder has the specific intent to kill.The fact that the intended\nvictim did not die is simply good fortune.The Supreme Court and this Court\nhave described an attempted murder offender as a “lucky murderer”:R. v.\nLogan, 1990 CanLII 84 (SCC), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 731 at p. 742-743; R. v. Bryan, 2008 NSCA 119 (CanLII),\nat ¶ 41.[112]While parity is one of the several sentencing\nprinciples, proportionality is the fundamental principle.Section 718.1\nestablishes that proportionality is most directly concerned with the gravity of\nthe offence and the degree of responsibility of the offence.Fundamental Principle718.1A sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence\nand the degree of responsibility of the offender.It is the individualisation of sentencing\nthat calls on a court to determine a fit sentence with regard to all relevant\nfactors concerning the offence and the offender.[113]In determining whether a sentence was fit and\nappropriate in all the circumstances, the case law on sentencing is helpful.The following case summaries, supplied by the Crown, provide guidance:(i)R. v. LeBlanc,\n2011 NSCA 60 (CanLII) …–This Court confirmed sixteen years’ incarceration for a\nbotched hit on James Melvin, Jr.The offender and others planned to kill Mr.\nMelvin and communicated with him in order to ascertain his whereabouts.The\noffender chased the victim, and fired a handgun a number of times.The victim\nwas struck twice suffering internal injuries for which he received surgery.The Appellant had a lengthy criminal record.There was no joint\nrecommendation;(ii)R. v. Smith, 2012\nNSCA 37 (CanLII) …–Seventeen and a half year old offender, nineteen at the time of\nsentencing, convicted of shooting Michael Patriquen, Jr. at close range in the\nchest.The victim suffered many health problems, including paraplegia.His\nlife expectancy to be shortened by twenty to twenty-nine years.The victim was\nshot at the request of an associate of the Appellant.A lengthy violent\ncriminal record and disturbing psychiatric profile.Fourteen years’\nincarceration confirmed on appeal;(iii)R. v. Clarke, 2010\nONSC 656 (CanLII) …–Offender shot victim in front of convenience store just after\nnoon.The victim suffered two chest wounds from a sawed-off shotgun at close\nrange.Injuries were life-threatening.Offender had young family.Four prior\nconvictions.Use of handgun in a public place during daylight hours, and\nreckless disregard for human life factors in informing twelve and a half years’\nimprisonment minus remand time;(iv)R. v. Guedez-Infante,\n2009 ONCA 739 (CanLII) …–Appellant was a young man with no prior criminal record.The shooting, however, took place in public leaving serious injury to the\nvictim.Alcohol involved.Ten years’ imprisonment confirmed on appeal;(v)R. v. Thompson,\n2009 ONCA 243 (CanLII) …–Few facts in appeal case.Twelve years affirmed on appeal\nfor serious shooting with a handgun planned in advance and committed in a\npublic place by individual with lengthy record, including convictions for\nviolence;(vi)R. v. Boissonneault,\n2012 MBCA 40 (CanLII) …–In the days leading up to a shooting in public, the\nAppellant was drinking, smoking crack cocaine and marijuana, and not sleeping\nmuch.He used a 357 Smith and Wesson to shoot the victim while he was sitting\nin a cab with another person.The Appellant harboured a strong dislike for the\nvictim.The Court of Appeal intervened where trial Judge failed to explain\nconsecutive sentences for firearm convictions which arose as a result of the\nattempt murder.Seventeen years in total reduced to fourteen years based on\ntotality.Appellant had significant criminal record; however, majority of\nconvictions were drug related.[Appears to be second degree attempted\nmurder.];(vii)R. v. Situ, 2010\nONCA 683 (CanLII) …–Two Appellants involved in horrific shooting in a public place\nwhich rendered victim quadriplegic.Situ had a criminal record.Fifteen\nyears’ incarceration confirmed on appeal;(viii)R. v. Truelove,\n2010 ONCA 608 (CanLII) …–Few facts from Court of Appeal decision.Conviction for\nattempted murder and several other charges which arose out of a shooting in a\nnightclub.Thirteen years’ incarceration upheld on appeal;(ix)R. v. Chevers, 2011\nONCA 569 (CanLII) …–Appellant twenty-four years old when he twice shot the victim in\na public place.He missed both times.Fifteen year sentence upheld on appeal\nwhere the Court noted the double-digit prison sentences for attempted murder\nhad been imposed in cases of planned executions involving the use of loaded\nfirearms.Other factors included premeditation, use of prohibited handgun,\nfiring two shots, impact on the victim and community, and offender’s prior\nrecord;(x)R. v. Brown, 2009\nONCA 563 (CanLII) …–At 7 p.m., June 14, 2005 victim shot six times at point-blank\nrange in parking lot.Victim survived, however paralyzed from the waist down.Numerous injuries to critical areas.Appellant was a first offender with a\nyoung child.No evidence of rehabilitative potential apart from implication\narising from youth.The Court characterized the offence as a cold-blooded\nsenseless act which was unprovoked.Life imprisonment confirmed due to use of\ngun without warning in a public place where other citizens, including children,\nwere present and at potential risk.Growing gun violence a proper and\nnecessary factor as well.[114]It appears that the low end of the range for\nattempted murder is around ten years’ imprisonment; the middle around 12; and\nthe high between 15 years and life.See also R. v. Tan, 2008 ONCA 574 (CanLII),\nat ¶ 35 to 39.[115]In this case, the aggravating factors include:(a)The brazen\nshooting in a hospital parking lot, a public place, in the early evening;(b)The use of a relatively\nhigh-powered handgun;(c)The firing of multiple\nshots; and(d)A\nlengthy criminal record, albeit mostly a youth record, including crimes of\nviolence and the use of weapons.The appellant on appeal denies any planning\nor joint enterprise with the co-accused because the telephone intercepts did\nnot include him taking part in the exchanges as the two vehicles sped to the\nhospital and Mr. Hallett.However, it is difficult to accept that Mr. Marriott\ncould not have known from hearing the urgency and content of the discussions,\nthat Mr. Hallett was the target.[116]The firing of multiple shots in a public place\nshows a callous and high disregard for the safety of others going about their\nbusiness.The attempted murder calls for denunciation of that unlawful conduct\nand for deterrence, specific to this offender and general to other members of\nthe public, that such actions will attract heavy penal consequences.[117]The mitigating factors are the appellant’s youth\n– he was 18 at the time of the shooting – and his guilty plea to attempted\nmurder.Since sentencing, he is doing well in the correctional institution and\nhas shone in his academic studies.However, the appellant did not plead guilty\nuntil the first day of trial.He did not do so until after the preliminary\ninquiries were held, negotiations between the Crown and trial counsel towards\nresolution of all charges including others of attempted murders were completed,\nand he had re-elected from trial by judge and jury to judge alone.[118]Having considered the offence and this offender,\nand the principles of sentencing and particularly those of proportionality and\nsentence, it is my view that 15 years imprisonment on a go forward basis may be\nat the higher end, but is still within the range of sentence.Consequently, it\nis not a demonstrably unfit sentence.Disposition[119]I would admit the fresh evidence, grant leave to\nappeal but dismiss the appeal.Oland,\nJ.A.Concurred in:Fichaud, J.A.Farrar,\nJ.A."}

Following conviction, the Crown made an application to designate\nMr. Knife as a dangerous offender. The sentencing judge declined to do so. Mr.\nKnife was instead designated a long-term offender and sentenced to eight years’\nimprisonment and a long-term supervision order of ten years. Mr. Knife\nappeals his conviction. The Crown appeals the trial judge’s refusal to\ndesignate Mr. Knife as a dangerous offender. Finally, Mr. Knife cross-appeals\nhis sentence contending it to be unfit.[2]At the hearing, Mr. Knife abandoned his conviction appeal. For\nthe reasons that follow, the Crown’s dangerous offender appeal is allowed, and it\nis hereby ordered that Mr. Knife shall be designated as a dangerous offender. His\nsubstantive sentence is not altered. It follows Mr. Knife’s sentence\nappeal is dismissed.II.BackgroundA.Facts[3]The maximum security unit of the Saskatchewan\nPenitentiary has a special block designated for members of the Indian Posse and\nrelated gangs, known as “B Block”. Mr. Knife was serving a sentence for\nmanslaughter in the penitentiary and, because he was a member of the Indian\nPosse at the time of the offence, he was housed on B Block.[4]The charges arose out of an incident which occurred\nin the B Block common room on the evening of September 1, 2008. The incident\nwas captured by two surveillance videos. The following summary is adopted from\nthe trial judge’s description of the events occurring on the videos, the facts\nof which are not in dispute.[5]Mr. Knife and eight other inmates were relaxing\nand socializing in the common room at approximately 8:00 p.m. that evening.\nNothing appeared to be amiss.[6]At 8:25 p.m., Keith Coutu filled up a cup with\nliquid, placed it in the microwave, and turned it on. Approximately three\nminutes later, he took it out of the microwave. He walked over to one of the\ntables where Murray Dorion (the first victim) was sitting. Mr. Knife and\nTristan Raphael followed Mr. Coutu to the table.[7]Mr. Coutu sat down next to Mr. Dorion and threw\nthe cup of hot liquid in Mr. Dorion’s face. Mr. Coutu then began to stab Mr.\nDorion, and Mr. Knife joined in. Mr. Knife and Mr. Coutu delivered numerous\nstab wounds to Mr. Dorion.[8]At this point, Darren Demeria (the second\nvictim) attempted to come to Mr. Dorion’s aid. He pulled Mr. Knife away from\nMr. Dorion and they began to wrestle. Cory Dreaver then joined in the fray and\nbegan to repeatedly stab Mr. Demeria. As Messrs. Knife, Demeria, and Dreaver\ncontinued to wrestle with each other, Mr. Knife managed to get close to Mr.\nDorion (who was still being stabbed by Mr. Coutu) and stabbed Mr. Dorion several\nmore times.[9]While Mr. Knife was stabbing Mr. Dorion, Mr.\nDreaver picked up a television set, which he promptly threw at Mr. Demeria. Mr.\nDemeria deflected the television set. Mr. Knife picked it up and threw it at\nMr. Demeria again. Messrs. Knife and Dreaver then began to stab Mr. Demeria\nrepeatedly.[10]Mr. Demeria eventually managed to escape from\nMessrs. Knife and Dreaver. Mr. Knife and Mr. Dreaver then returned to Mr. Dorion,\nwho was now being stabbed by Mr. Raphael. Messrs. Knife, Dreaver, Coutu, and\nRaphael began to stab Mr. Dorion together.[11]The melee finally ended when a corrections\nofficer fired a warning shot into the wall of the common room and directed all\nof the inmates to lie prone on the floor. Each inmate was removed from the\ncommon room individually. After the inmates were removed, seven homemade knives\nwere found in and around the common room.[12]Despite the large number of stab wounds that\nthey received, Mr. Dorion and Mr. Demeria both managed to escape serious\ninjury. Mr. Dorion received first and second degree burns to his face, eye,\nneck, and shoulders. He also sustained a large number of puncture wounds, but\nnone were overly-serious.[13]Messrs. Knife, Coutu, and Raphael were all\ncharged with aggravated assault. Mr. Knife was also charged with one count of\ncommon assault for the attack on Mr. Demeria. Mr. Coutu and Mr. Raphael each\nentered a guilty plea and were sentenced separately pursuant to joint\nsubmissions. Mr. Knife pleaded not guilty and the matter proceeded to trial.B.Decision Below[14]The only real issue at trial was whether the\ndefence of self-defence applied. Mr. Knife testified that at approximately\n11:30 a.m. on the day of the offence, Mr. Dorion and several other inmates made\nan unprompted threat toward Messrs. Knife, Coutu, Dreaver, Raphael and Dustin\nEagle (who ultimately did not participate in the common room assault). This\nthreat was something to the effect that Mr. Dorion and his group were going to\ntake Mr. Knife and his group out. Mr. Dorion and his associates were\napparently brandishing homemade knives as they threatened Mr. Knife and others.[15]Mr. Knife testified it was this threat of\nviolence, in combination with other small details he had noticed throughout the\nday, which led him to conclude he and his group would be attacked by Mr. Dorion\nand his friends if he did not attack first. Mr. Knife took the position he\nlawfully acted in self-defence, and he should not be convicted.[16]The trial judge rejected this argument. He\naccepted the threats of the morning could constitute an assault on Mr. Knife\nbut the elements of self-defence as set out in s. 34(2) of the Criminal Code\n(as it read in 2008) were not met. He found Mr. Knife did not subjectively\nbelieve he was being assaulted at the time he stabbed the victims and that,\neven if he did hold such a belief, the belief was not objectively reasonable. He\nalso found the other two elements of the defence could not be established in\nthis case. He held the defence could not apply, and convicted Mr. Knife\naccordingly.[17]Following conviction, the Crown made an\napplication to designate Mr. Knife as a dangerous offender. The trial\njudge declined to make such a designation, as he found none of the criteria\nlisted in s. 753(1)(a) of the Criminal Code were met. He found that there\nwas no pattern of repetitive or aggressive behaviour by Mr. Knife, as the predicate\noffences were only Mr. Knife’s second adult conviction.[18]The trial judge reasoned that Mr. Knife’s only\nother adult conviction—a manslaughter conviction—was too dissimilar to the\npredicate offence to constitute a pattern. The manslaughter conviction was the\nproduct of a drunken argument which resulted in Mr. Knife stabbing two people\n(and killing one), while the predicate offence was the product of Mr. Knife’s\ninvolvement in the gang lifestyle. His youth offences did not involve similar\nlevels of violence, and the trial judge did not believe they were particularly\nrelevant to the issue of whether a sufficient pattern of behaviour could be\nestablished.[19]Although the trial judge declined to designate\nMr. Knife a dangerous offender, he was satisfied Mr. Knife should be designated\nas a long-term offender pursuant to s. 753.1 of the Criminal Code. He\nsentenced Mr. Knife to eight years’ imprisonment (less four years remand time),\na ten-year long-term supervision order, and the necessary ancillary orders.III.Conviction appeal[20]As stated earlier, counsel for the appellant advised the panel at\nthe beginning of oral argument of Mr. Knife‘s intention to abandon his\nconviction appeal.IV.CROWN SENTENCE APPEAL[21]There is only one issue on the Crown’s sentence appeal: did the\ntrial judge err in failing to designate Mr. Knife as a dangerous offender? The Crown does not ask us to alter Mr. Knife’s substantive sentence,\nbut only to alter Mr. Knife’s designation. This is for the purposes of s. 753.01\nwhich deals with the situation where a dangerous offender is later convicted of\na serious personal injury offence or an offence under subsection 753.3(1). By\nvirtue of this provision, a prosecutor can apply for an assessment and apply\nfor an indeterminate sentence. The dangerous offender can then be sentenced\naccording to the principles of dangerous offender sentencing. In other words,\nthe Crown does not have to run another dangerous offender hearing if Mr. Knife\nreoffends. The section does not apply to a long-term offender.A.Jurisdiction and Standard of Review[22]The predicate offences were committed in September of 2008, after\nthe 2008 amendments to Part XXIV of the Criminal Code had come into\neffect. The relevant provision is s. 753(1)(a), which states:753. (1) On application made under\nthis Part after an assessment report is filed under subsection 752.1(2), the\ncourt shall find the offender to be a dangerous offender if it is satisfied(a) that the\noffence for which the offender has been convicted is a serious personal injury\noffence described in paragraph (a) of the definition of that expression in\nsection 752 and the offender constitutes a threat to the life, safety or\nphysical or mental well-being of other persons on the basis of evidence\nestablishing(i) a pattern\nof repetitive behaviour by the offender, of which the offence for which he or\nshe has been convicted forms a part, showing a failure to restrain his or her\nbehaviour and a likelihood of causing death or injury to other persons, or\ninflicting severe psychological damage on other persons, through failure in the\nfuture to restrain his or her behaviour,(ii) a\npattern of persistent aggressive behaviour by the offender, of which the\noffence for which he or she has been convicted forms a part, showing a\nsubstantial degree of indifference on the part of the offender respecting the\nreasonably foreseeable consequences to other persons of his or her behaviour,\nor(iii) any\nbehaviour by the offender, associated with the offence for which he or she has\nbeen convicted, that is of such a brutal nature as to compel the conclusion\nthat the offender’s behaviour in the future is unlikely to be inhibited by\nnormal standards of behavioural restraint[.][23]This is a Crown appeal from a dangerous offender\nproceeding, taken pursuant to s. 759(2) of the Criminal Code, as such it\nis limited to a question of law. It follows the applicable standard of review\nis correctness: R v Dagenais, 2003 ABCA 376 (CanLII) at para 62, 181 CCC (3d) 332.[24]The Crown argues the sentencing judge erred in\nlaw by misinterpreting s. 753(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, and\nrequiring too high a degree of factual similarity between Mr. Knife’s prior\noffences and the predicate offence. This, according to the Crown, caused the\nsentencing judge to lose sight of the purpose of s. 753(1)(a), which is to\nidentify offenders who are truly dangerous.[25]The Crown also argues that the sentencing judge\nerred in failing to consider Mr. Knife’s youth offending when determining\nwhether a pattern of behaviour was made out; and that the sentencing judge\nerred by failing to consider the expert evidence adduced at the dangerous\noffender hearing when determining whether the requisite pattern of behaviour\nwas made out. In the Crown’s view, these errors led the sentencing judge to\ndetermine that a dangerous offender designation should not be imposed. The Crown\nsubmits that the statutory requirements in s. 753(1)(a)(i) or (ii) were made\nout in this case, and Mr. Knife should be designated as a dangerous offender. Thus,\nif s. 753(1)(a)(i) is made out then the Court does not have to proceed to\ns.753(1)(a)(ii).[26]To deal with this Crown appeal, I will begin by\nbriefly reviewing Mr. Knife’s offending history, the expert evidence tendered\nat the dangerous offender hearing, and the sentencing judge’s decision. I will\nthen turn to the errors alleged by the Crown and the proper interpretation of\ns. 753(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. Finally, I will assess whether Mr.\nKnife should be designated as a dangerous offender.B.Mr. Knife’s Offending History[27]The following summary of Mr. Knife’s prior violent\noffences is taken from the evidence presented at the dangerous offender\nhearing.[28]Mr. Knife’s violent offending began when he was\n12 years old. He and another youth confronted a young boy in Prince Albert. Mr.\nKnife grabbed the boy’s shirt and demanded money from him. He was sentenced to\n30 hours of community service and one year of probation.[29]The next offence occurred when Mr. Knife was 14\nyears old. He and several others broke into a school in Prince Albert and stole\nsome basketballs. The police interviewed one of the boys, who said Mr. Knife\nwas involved in the break-in. Mr. Knife and several others confronted the boy a\nfew days later. They pushed him and swore at him. Mr. Knife tried to punch the\nvictim and tried to knee the victim in the face. The victim’s glasses fell on\nthe floor and Mr. Knife smashed them. He was convicted of break and enter and\nassault and sentenced to 100 hours of community service and 14 months of\nprobation.[30]In October of 2000, he was convicted of two more\noffences. One was a count of break and enter, as Mr. Knife and several other\naccomplices broke into a school in Prince Albert and stole eight computers. The\nother offence was a robbery conviction. Mr. Knife and several of his\naccomplices approached two boys playing basketball. They placed the boys in a\nchokehold and stole the victims’ bicycles. Mr. Knife was sentenced to a total\nsentence of eight months open custody and 18 months of probation.[31]His next convictions occurred in August of 2003.\nHe was convicted of assault with a weapon, break and enter, and robbery. The\nassault with a weapon and robbery convictions arose out of an incident where\nMr. Knife and another accomplice confronted two boys on the street in Prince\nAlbert. Mr. Knife and his accomplice told the victims to empty their\npockets, and both complied. Mr. Knife was armed with a beer bottle and his\naccomplice was armed with a crowbar. Mr. Knife hit both victims with the beer\nbottle. He was sentenced to seven months secure custody and two years of\nprobation.[32]Mr. Knife committed his first adult offence in\nJune of 2005. He was at a party in Creighton, Saskatchewan with his\nsister-in-law and one of her friends. The two girls left the party and met up\nwith Robert Morin and Ben Dumas. The four of them went to Mr. Dumas’\nhouse. Mr. Knife phoned Mr. Dumas’ residence, and he argued with Mr. Dumas over\nthe phone. Mr. Knife went over to Mr. Dumas’ residence and, upon arrival,\nwas apparently confronted by Mr. Dumas who was armed with a knife. He wrestled\nthe knife away from Mr. Dumas and used it to stab Mr. Dumas twice. Mr. Morin\ncame over to break up the fight, and Mr. Knife stabbed Mr. Morin three times.\nMr. Morin died of his injuries, while Mr. Dumas survived. Mr. Knife\npleaded guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced to six years imprisonment\n(less four years remand credit). He was serving this sentence at the time of\nthe predicate offence.[33]Institutional documents filed at the dangerous\noffender hearing indicate that Mr. Knife was involved in several violent\nincidents while on remand awaiting trial on the manslaughter offence. In August\nof 2005, Mr. Knife was involved in a fight with Lanny Dumas, the cousin of the\nsurviving victim of the manslaughter offence. In April of 2006, corrections\nofficials observed Mr. Knife attacking another inmate with a hockey stick.\nIn June of 2007, Mr. Knife fought with a member of a rival gang,\nrepeatedly punching the victim’s head and face and causing a scalp wound that\nrequired stitches. No criminal charges were laid as a result of any of these\nincidents.C.Expert Evidence[34]There were two expert psychiatric reports\ntendered at the dangerous offender hearing: the Crown tendered a report by Dr. Lohrasbe,\nand the defence tendered a report by Dr. Nicholaichuk. Both psychiatrists also\ntestified. The following is a summary of the reports and testimony of both as\nit pertained to Mr. Knife’s risk to reoffend.[35]Dr. Lohrasbe diagnosed Mr. Knife with an\nAntisocial Personality Disorder, with significant psychopathic traits. He\nidentified alcohol and drug abuse as two areas where Mr. Knife requires\nsignificant intervention in order to reduce his risk to reoffend.[36]Dr. Lohrasbe assessed Mr. Knife as being at a\nhigh risk to reoffend violently. He described Mr. Knife’s antisociality and\ndeviant behaviour as “broad and deep”, as he has engaged in a wide range of\ncriminal activities from an early age, and this criminality is a “major aspect\nof his social identity.”[37]Dr. Lohrasbe administered the HCR-20 to assess\nMr. Knife’s risk to reoffend. The HCR-20 is a structured guideline that is\ncommonly used to evaluate an offender’s risk of reoffending. It involves the\nevaluation of the presence or absence of 20 risk factors and their impact on\nthe likelihood that the offender will continue to offend in the future. Using\nthe HCR-20, he found 11 risk factors were present, three were absent, and the\nrest could not be rated based on the information available to him.[38]In discussing the ways in which Mr. Knife’s risk\ncould be reduced, Dr. Lohrasbe indicated that Mr. Knife has not yet had\nthe opportunity to complete any institutional programming for his violence or\nsubstance abuse problems. Because he has not had this opportunity, Dr. Lohrasbe\ncould not assess how he responds to treatment, and whether treatment may be\nuseful in reducing his overall risk to reoffend. It was thus impossible for him\nto conclude there was no reasonable possibility of controlling his risk in the community.[39]Dr. Lohrasbe also discussed Mr. Knife’s\ncontinued insistence he has left the Indian Posse gang. Mr. Knife testified at\ntrial he left the Indian Posse in December of 2008 (after the predicate\noffences were committed) and he was moved to a different range in the\nSaskatchewan Penitentiary. He has continually affirmed since then he is no\nlonger involved with the Indian Posse. Various institutional documents filed at\nthe dangerous offender hearing indicate Mr. Knife may have continued to be involved\nwith the Indian Posse after December of 2008, but this was never proved.[40]Dr. Lohrasbe stated that, if Mr. Knife has truly\nleft the Indian Posse, it would be unreasonable for him to conclude Mr. Knife\nwas untreatable or unmanageable in the community. However, Dr. Lohrasbe noted\nthat reducing Mr. Knife’s risk of reoffending is still a “monumental\nundertaking” even without gang membership.[41]Dr. Nicholaichuk agreed with Dr. Lohrasbe that\nMr. Knife exhibits “notable anti-social attitudes” and remains “significantly\ncriminalised” in these attitudes. He also agreed Mr. Knife exhibits\npsychopathic personality characteristics, but these characteristics are not\nextreme.[42]Dr. Nicholaichuk administered the Minnesota\nMultiphasic Personality Inventory [MMPI-2], which is a scale that is commonly\nused to diagnose personality issues. He concluded Mr. Knife suffers from\nmoderate emotional distress, characterized by brooding, dysphoria, and\nanhedonia.[43]Dr. Nicholaichuk rated Mr. Knife on several actuarial\nscales to assess his risk of reoffending. He concluded that “45% or more” of\nindividuals like Mr. Knife can be expected to be reincarcerated within one year\nof release. He concluded that Mr. Knife has a 40% chance to reoffend violently\nwithin 4.4 years of release. The factors relevant to his assessment of Mr.\nKnife’s risk to reoffend include his criminal history, his lack of education\nand employment skills, his substance abuse, and his association with\npro-criminalized peers. His extensive history of violence contributed to his\nrisk of reoffending violently.[44]Dr. Nicholaichuk testified that without any\nintervention Mr. Knife is at a high risk to reoffend. He agreed with Dr. Lohrasbe\nthe absence of institutional programming means it is too early to conclude such\nprogramming would not be effective and Mr. Knife’s risk could not be managed in\nthe community.D.Decision Below[45]The dangerous offender application turned on\nwhether the Crown was able to prove that a pattern of behaviour under either s.\n753(1)(a)(i) or s. 753(1)(a)(ii) was established in this case. The trial\njudge found the Crown had failed to do so. His reasons on this point are\nsuccinct:[56]After a careful and\nthorough examination of all of the evidence, I am not satisfied that the Crown\nhas established either of the requisite patterns referred to in (i) or (ii).[57]The offender has only one\nprevious adult criminal conviction. The conviction, a manslaughter, occurred\nwhen he was just 19 years old. While extremely intoxicated on a combination of\nalcohol and drugs, he stabbed the victim with a knife during a fight. There is\nno evidence that the offender was part of a gang or that the commission of that\ncrime had any gang overtones. The offender acted alone. There was no\npremeditation. The offence can be characterised as a senseless drunken argument\ngone horribly wrong.[58]Over three years later,\nafter embracing the gang lifestyle while in custody, the offender and several\nothers attacked a rival gang member in a common area within the prison. Hot liquid\nwas thrown in the victim’s face, and he was repeatedly stabbed by the offender\nand his accomplices. This offence, the predicate offence, was committed while\nsober and in custody and was part of a calculated plan to inflict serious harm\non a rival gang member for motives related to self-preservation and/or\nintimidation.[59]Although both incidents\nhave common aspects – a violent stabbing – the situations are sufficiently\ndissimilar so as not to constitute a pattern as contemplated by ss.\n753(1)(a)(i) or (ii).[60]The Crown took great pains\nduring the hearing to attempt to characterise all of the offender’s past\nindiscretions as part of an overall pattern of repetitive or persistent\naggressive behaviour. In fact, it was argued that even the incidents when the\noffender grabbed a classmate and asked for money at age 12 and broke another\nacquaintance’s glasses at age 14 are part of this overall pattern. While such\ninstances are admissible and marginally relevant, they fall far short of\nestablishing the types of patterns contemplated by ss. 753(1)(a)(i) or (ii)\neven when combined with the offender’s institutional history and his\nmanslaughter conviction. While it is a fair observation that the offender’s\nfrequent involvement with the criminal justice system indicates a serious\nproblem, I am unable to find the requisite pattern necessary to satisfy the\ncriteria of either s. 753(1)(a)(i) or s. 753(1)(a)(ii). (emphasis added)[46]The trial judge was thus not satisfied that the\npattern of criminal behaviour required by ss. 753(1)(a)(i) or (ii) was\nestablished. He declined to designate Mr. Knife as a dangerous offender.E.Analysis[47]The Crown has appealed this decision. It argues the\ntrial judge erred by requiring too high a degree of factual similarity between\nMr. Knife’s offences. It also argues the trial judge erred by failing to properly\ntake Mr. Knife’s youth offences into account and by failing to consider the\nexpert evidence.[48]These arguments raise three interrelated issues,\nall stemming from the wording of s. 753(1)(a) and its application. While this\nis certainly not the first appellate decision to consider this section of the Criminal\nCode, it is nevertheless useful to review what the section says, why it\nsays it, and how it should be applied.[49]I propose to conduct this review in two stages:\nfirst, by assessing the purpose of the provision; and second, by examining how\nother appellate courts have interpreted the notion of a “pattern” of behaviour.\nWith the principles discerned from this review in mind, I will then turn to the\nerrors alleged by the Crown in this case.1.The Purpose of Section 753(1)(a)[50]Section 753(1)(a)(i) states that an offender shall\nbe designated as a dangerous offender on the basis of evidence establishing “a\npattern of repetitive behaviour by the offender, of which the offence for which\nhe or she has been convicted forms a part”. Further, this pattern must show “a\nfailure to restrain” the offender’s behaviour and a likelihood of causing death\nor injury in the future to other persons through the offender’s failure to\nrestrain his or her behaviour.[51]Section 753(1)(a)(ii) is similarly worded. Under\nthis provision, an offender shall be designated as a dangerous offender based\non evidence establishing “a pattern of persistent aggressive behaviour by the\noffender, of which the offence for which he or she has been convicted forms a\npart”. This pattern must show “a substantial degree of indifference on the part\nof the offender respecting the reasonably foreseeable consequences to other\npersons of his or her behaviour”.[52]The seminal decision on the purpose of Part XXIV\nof the Criminal Code is the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in R v\nLyons, 1987 CanLII 25 (SCC), [1987] 2 SCR 309 [Lyons]. In considering the\nconstitutionality of the preventive detention provisions in Part XXIV (then\nPart XXI), La Forest J. articulated the legitimate purpose of these provisions\nat p. 323:The present\nlegislation, enacted in 1977, clearly pursues the historical purpose of\nprotecting the public, but is now carefully tailored so as to be confined in\nits application to those habitual criminals who are dangerous to others. In\nbrief, Part XXI provides that where a person has been found guilty of a “serious\npersonal injury offence”, the court may, upon application, find the offender to\nbe a dangerous offender and may thereupon impose a sentence of indeterminate\ndetention in lieu of any other sentence that the offender might have received\nfor the offence….[53]The Supreme Court has repeatedly affirmed the\npurpose of the dangerous offender provisions is the protection of the public:\nsee, e.g., R v Johnson, 2003 SCC 46 (CanLII) at para 19, [2003] 2 SCR 357; R v\nL.M., 2008 SCC 31 (CanLII) at para 42, [2008] 2 SCR 163; and most recently in R v\nSteele, 2014 SCC 61 (CanLII) at para 29, [2014] 3 SCR 138.[54]Section 753(1)(a) serves as a gateway to the\ndangerous offender sentencing provisions, which now impose a presumptive\nindeterminate sentence on the offender unless the sentencing judge is satisfied\nthat a lesser sentence would adequately protect the public: see s. 753(4.1).\nThe purpose of s. 753(1)(a) is to define those from whom the public must be\nprotected—i.e. to identify those who are truly dangerous.[55]The importance of past conduct for the s.\n753(1)(a) analysis is not simply to show the offender has committed violent\noffences in the past. The dangerous offender provisions are not intended to\npunish the offender again for his or her past offences, regardless of\nhow similar (or dissimilar) they may be. What is important is that, based on\nthose past offences, the offender is likely to continue to offend violently and\nendanger the public in the future. The past conduct provides the evidentiary\nbasis for assessing the future threat, but it is the future threat that Part\nXXIV is aimed at curbing.2.“Pattern” of Behaviour[56]Both ss. 753(1)(a)(i) and (ii) require the Crown\nto establish the existence of a pattern of behaviour, whether it be a “pattern\nof repetitive behaviour” or a “pattern of persistent aggressive behaviour”. For\nboth subparagraphs of this provision, the predicate offence must form part of\nthat pattern—in the words of the Newfoundland Court of Appeal, the predicate\noffence serves as the “last straw in a series of dangerous violence on the part\nof the perpetrator” (R v Newman (1994), 1994 CanLII 9717 (NL CA), 115 Nfld \u0026 PEIR 197 (Nfld\nCA) at para 71).[57]Other appellate courts have interpreted the\nmeaning of the “pattern” requirement in ss. 753(1)(a)(i) and (ii). Because the\nwording of these two subparagraphs has not changed since 1977, it does not\nmatter which statutory regime any of these cases were decided under. The words they\nwere interpreting are the same.[58]In R v Neve, 1999 ABCA 206 (CanLII), [1999] 11 WWR\n649 [Neve], the Alberta Court of Appeal interpreted the meaning of the\n“pattern” requirement, and identified the three requisite elements of a pattern\nwithin the meaning of this section: the incidents must be criminal in nature;\nthe past incidents must involve some degree of violence or attempted violence;\nand there must be similarity either in the kinds of offences or in the degree\nof violence used. The Court stated:[109] What do these sections require\nin assessing an offender’s past conduct? First, the type of past behaviour\nencompassed by these sections is criminal behaviour since the predicate\noffence, a criminal one by definition, must form part of the pattern of\nconduct. The dangerous offender legislation is directed at those who hurt\npeople through criminal, as opposed to simply anti-social, conduct. The latter\ncannot be the foundation for a dangerous offender application.[110] This takes us to the second\npoint: the quality of the past behaviour. Does all criminal behaviour form part\nof the pattern? In our view, it does not. We read s. 753(a) as requiring\nthat the court be satisfied on two points: (a) that the predicate offence is\npart of a pattern of behaviour which has involved violent, aggressive or brutal\nconduct; and (b) that it is likely that this pattern of conduct will continue\nand will lead to conduct endangering the life, safety or physical well-being of\nothers: see Lyons, supra. Since a predicate offence under s. 753(a) must\nbe a “serious personal injury offence” (meaning that it itself must meet either\na violence or endangerment requirement under s. 752(a)), it follows logically\nthat the past behaviour must also have involved some degree of violence or\nattempted violence or endangerment or likely endangerment (whether more or less\nserious than the predicate offence). Otherwise, the predicate offence would not\nbe part of that pattern.[111] Third, repetitive behaviour\nunder s. 753(a)(i) and persistent aggressive behaviour under s. 753(a)(ii) can\nbe established on two different bases. [Persistent in this context has been\nequated with repetitive: Yanoshewski, supra.] The first is where there\nare similarities in terms of the kind of offences; the second where the\noffences themselves are not similar in kind, but in result, in terms of the\ndegree of violence or aggression inflicted on the victims. Either will do.\nThus, the mere fact that an offender commits a variety of crimes does not mean\nthat no pattern exists. There is no requirement that the past criminal actions\nall be of the same or similar form, order or arrangement; though if this has\noccurred, it may well suffice.[59]The British Columbia Court of Appeal utilized a\nsimilar interpretation in its slightly earlier decision in R v Dow, 1999\nBCCA 177 (CanLII), 134 CCC (3d) 323 [Dow]. It stated:[24] In short, the significance and the\nrelevance of common elements of the pattern must be determined by whether they\ntend to show first, repetitive behaviour, second, that there has been a failure\nin each case to restrain the behaviour, and third, that there has been injury\nto other persons arising from that failure. If any of those three elements is\nmissing, then there may be a pattern but it will not be a relevant pattern. But\nif all three are present then the essential elements of a relevant pattern are\nrevealed.[60]In R v Hogg, 2011 ONCA 840 (CanLII), 287 OAC 82,\nthe Ontario Court of Appeal considered an appeal by an offender who was\ndesignated as a dangerous offender and sentenced to an indeterminate sentence.\nHe argued on appeal the trial judge erred in concluding the predicate offence\nwas sufficiently similar to his prior offences to constitute a pattern for the\npurpose of s. 753(1)(a)(i). The Ontario Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal,\nand stated:[40] To summarize, the pattern of repetitive\nbehaviour that includes the predicate offence has to contain enough of the same\nelements of unrestrained dangerous conduct to be able to predict that the\noffender will likely offend in the same way in the future. This will ensure\nthat the level of gravity of the behaviour is the same, so that the concern\nraised by Marshall J.A. – that the last straw could be a much more minor\ninfraction – could not result in a dangerous offender designation. However, the\noffences need not be the same in every detail; that would unduly restrict the\napplication of the section.[61]In R v Pike, 2010 BCCA 401 (CanLII), 260 CCC (3d)\n68, the British Columbia Court of Appeal addressed the issue of whether a link\nmust exist in s. 753(1)(a)(i) between the pattern of repetitive behaviour\nand the potential for future offending in order for an offender to be\ndesignated as a dangerous offender. The Court held such a link must exist. It\nstated:[80] The “threat” under s. (a) is to\nbe determined “on the basis of evidence” of a pattern of behaviour under ss.\n(i) or (ii). That pattern, in turn, must be linked to the predicate offence.[81] Breaking any of these\nconnections – between the predicate offence, the pattern analysis or the threat\nassessment – distorts the careful balance of the provisions, and risks serious\ninjustice. This is revealed more clearly when one considers the provisions\nbroadly.…[83] Similarly, the pattern analysis\nis inextricably linked to the ultimate threat assessment. It is the basis for\npredicting the future behaviour which threatens others. As explained in Neve,\nthe two are linked in the sense that “the court cannot make a determination\nthat an offender constitutes a threat in the manner specified in s. 753(a)\nexcept on the basis of evidence that meets at least one of the specified\nbehaviour thresholds….[62]In R v Szostak, 2014 ONCA 15 (CanLII), 306 CCC\n(3d) 68 [Szostak], the Ontario Court of Appeal held the offences need\nnot be serial offences and the offender’s behaviour need not be intractable for\na pattern to be made out under ss. 753(1)(a)(i) or (ii):[60] First, the trial judge erred in\nfinding that since the offences were “spontaneous occurrences” they could not\nbe said to be “serial offences”. There is no requirement that the offences be\nserial offences. Indeed, the fact that the various offences were spontaneous\nstrongly tells in favour of a pattern in the sense of both paras. (i) and (ii).\nLooking particularly at para. (i), that the appellant was capable of\nspontaneously acting with such great violence as exhibited in the four offences\ndemonstrates a failure to restrain his behaviour and a likelihood of causing\ndeath or injury to other persons through failure in the future to restrain his\nor her behaviour.…[62] As I have said, the present\nlegislation does not require intractability as a necessary element for a\nfinding of dangerous offender. Intractability will be an important\nconsideration for the sentencing judge in deciding what disposition to impose\nunder s. 753(4) and (4.1).[63]While the Supreme Court’s decision in Lyons\nwas not about the pattern requirement for designating an individual as a\ndangerous offender, La Forest J. nevertheless made some useful statements\nregarding the type of individuals that these provisions are intended to\ncapture. In discussing the restricted application of these provisions, he\nstated at p. 338:First, the\nlegislation applies only to persons convicted of a “serious personal injury\noffence” as defined in s. 687 [now s. 752]. These offences all relate to\nconduct tending to cause severe physical danger or severe psychological injury\nto other persons. Significantly, the maximum penalty for all these offences\nmust be at least ten years’ imprisonment. Secondly, it must be established to\nthe satisfaction of the court that the offence for which the person has been\nconvicted is not an isolated occurrence, but part of a pattern of behaviour\nwhich has involved violence, aggressive or brutal conduct, or a failure to\ncontrol sexual impulses. Thirdly, it must be established that the pattern of\nconduct is very likely to continue and to result in the kind of suffering\nagainst which the section seeks to protect, namely, conduct endangering the\nlife, safety or physical well-being of others or, in the case of sexual\noffences, conduct causing injury, pain or evil to other persons. Also explicit\nin one form or another in each subparagraph of s. 687 is the requirement that\nthe court must be satisfied that the pattern of conduct is substantially or pathologically\nintractable….3.Summary[64]Section 753(1)(a) is aimed at identifying\npatterns of violent behaviour. It is the repetition of the violent behaviour\nwhich forms the pattern.[65]Repetition obviously implies there is more than\none offence. Thus an offender must have prior violent offences (even if only\none), and the predicate offence must constitute a repetition of the offender’s\nviolent behaviour.[66]This is true of both s. 753(1)(a)(i) and s.\n753(1)(a)(ii). Both are aimed at identifying repetitive violent behaviour. For\ns. 753(1)(a)(i), the repetitive behaviour must show a failure to restrain the\noffender’s behaviour as well as a likelihood of causing death or injury to\nother persons. For s. 753(1)(a)(ii), the repetitive behaviour must show a\nsubstantial indifference on the part of the offender respecting the reasonably\nforeseeable consequences to other persons of his or her actions.[67]There are two main ways of identifying this\nrepetitive behaviour: as stated in Neve at para. 111, there may be\nsimilarities in the types of offences, or similarities in the degree of\nviolence used. For example, an offender with a history of committing aggravated\nassaults has necessarily demonstrated a repetition of violent behaviour, as a\nhigh degree of violence is implied in the very nature of aggravated assault.\nRosenberg J.A. in the Szostak decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal,\nat para. 63, agreed with Neve stating “Similarity… can be found not only\nin the types of offences but also in the degree of violence or aggression\nthreatened or inflicted on the victims” (Neve at para. 113).[68]However, despite similarities in the violent\nbehaviour, the offences may be different due to extrinsic factors: for\nexample, the victim may have died rather than been wounded (leading to a manslaughter\ncharge rather than an assault charge); or the offender may have pleaded guilty\nto a lesser included offence for the purpose of a plea bargain. These extrinsic\nfactors may mean the types of offences on the offender’s record are not the\nsame, despite the fact the offender has repeatedly engaged in a similar degree\nof violent behaviour. To ensure the dissimilarities in extrinsic factors do not\naffect the issue of whether an offender is a dangerous offender, “repetition”\ncan be demonstrated by similarities in the degree of violence used.[69]The Alberta Court of Appeal chose to use the\nphrase “degree of violence” to describe this latter idea in Neve.\nAnother way of characterizing this same idea could be to refer to it as the\n“nature of the violence”. The nature of violence used may demonstrate\nsignificant similarities in the offender’s behaviour which in turn may ground a\nfinding of “repetitive behaviour”—for example, an offender who continually uses\nweapons to committing violent offences, regardless of what the specific type of\noffence is. The point is that the focus should be on similarities in the\noffender’s violent behaviour that show a failure to restrain that behaviour.[70]Thus, where an offender has repeatedly engaged\nin violent behaviour and a pattern has been established showing (a) a failure\nto restrain his or her behaviour and (b) a likelihood of causing death or\ninjury to other persons, or inflicting severe psychological damage on other\npersons in the future through a failure to restrain such behaviour, the\noffender must be designated as a dangerous offender. The fact of repetition\ndemonstrates a failure to restrain the violent behaviour but the additional\nelement of future risk must also be established.[71]Similarly, once a pattern of persistent\naggressive behaviour has been demonstrated under s. 753(1)(a)(ii) showing a\nsubstantial degree of indifference on the part of the offender respecting the\nreasonably foreseeable consequences of his or her actions, then the offender\nmust be designated as a dangerous offender.[72]Thus, the pattern/repetition analysis provides\nthe evidentiary basis for assessing the future threat. It is this future threat\nthe dangerous offender provisions are aimed at curbing. Broadly speaking, if a\ncourt is unable to conclude the offender will pose a danger to the public in\nthe future based on the offender’s prior violent offences, the requirements of\ns. 753(1)(a) have not been met and the offender must not be designated as a\ndangerous offender. However, if it is apparent the predicate offence is not an\nisolated occurrence but is rather a repetition of violent behaviour which shows\na failure to restrain violent behaviour and is likely to continue in the future\ncausing injury or death to others (for s. 753(1)(a)(i)), then the offender does\npose a danger to the public in the required sense and should be accordingly\ndesignated as a dangerous offender.[73]With these principles in mind, I turn to the\nsentencing judge’s decision in this case.4.The Alleged Errors[74]The Crown argues: the sentencing judge erred by reading\ns. 753 (1)(a) as requiring too high a degree of factual similarity between the\nmanslaughter offence and the predicate offence; the sentencing judge failed to\nrecognize the importance of Mr. Knife’s youth offences; and finally, the\nsentencing judge erred by failing to take into account the expert evidence. Its\nkey submission is the first point and, as a result, I will focus on that point.[75]I reiterate this is a Crown appeal and it is\nlimited to a question of law alone. The Crown frames the question of law here\nas an error in interpreting a statutory provision, namely s. 753(1)(a). I\naccept that the proper interpretation of s. 753(1)(a) is a question of law for\nthe purpose of a Crown appeal: Dow at para. 27. The assessment of the\nevidence based on an alleged misinterpretation of this provision also raises a\nquestion of law: Szostak at paras. 58-59; R v J.M.H., 2011 SCC 45 (CanLII)\nat paras 29-30, [2011] 3 SCR 197.[76]In my opinion, the sentencing judge did err by\nrequiring too high a degree of factual similarity between the circumstances of\nthe offences. He focused on the differences in the specific contexts of the\n2005 manslaughter offence and the 2008 predicate offence, namely that the 2005\nmanslaughter involved significant alcohol consumption and had nothing to do\nwith gangs, while the predicate offence involved no alcohol at all and was\nentirely gang-related. He did not assess whether there was nevertheless\nsufficient similarity in the violent behaviour to allow him to conclude that\nsuch behaviour is likely to continue in the future and is likely to cause\ninjury or death to others.[77]The sentencing judge also failed to assess whether\nthere were any similarities in the elements of unrestrained behaviour between\nthe youth offences, the manslaughter, and the predicate offences that were sufficient\nto establish a pattern of dangerous behaviour. He found the elements of a\n“pattern” to be missing in this case. However, with respect, he did so in\nerror.[78]As stated above, the purpose of the “pattern”\nrequirement is to determine whether there is an evidentiary basis capable of\nsupporting a finding the offender is likely to continue to violently offend in\nthe future as per ss. 753(1)(a)(i) or (ii), and is thus a person from whom the\npublic must be protected. Factual similarities in the contexts of the\noffender’s previous offences are relevant, but similarities in the actual\nviolence used cannot be ignored. The lack of contextual similarities is not\nfatal to the existence of a pattern if there are sufficient similarities in the\nelements of the offender’s violent behaviour to show a failure to restrain that\nbehaviour and a likelihood of causing death or injury in the future.[79]Thus, the sentencing judge erred in his\ninterpretation of what is required by s. 753(1)(a). Because this error involved\nthe interpretation and application of a statutory provision, it is an error of\nlaw. This leads to the next issue: what this Court should do in light of this\nerror.[80]Section 759(3) of the Criminal Code sets\nout the powers of this Court in a Part XXIV appeal. It may allow the appeal and\nfind Mr. Knife to be a dangerous offender, alter the sentence, or order a new\nhearing. As the British Columbia Court of Appeal stated in Dow, whether\nan appellate court should impose a dangerous offender designation on its own\ndepends on the nature of the identified error:[37] I think the correct approach to the\nquestion of whether, having identified the error in law, the Court should make\na finding that the offender is a dangerous offender must lie in looking at the\nnature of the error in law, looking at the evidence and any relevant findings\nof fact by the trial judge that are not contaminated by the error, and deciding\nwhether, on the evidence and on those findings of fact, it is clear beyond a\nreasonable doubt that the offender met all the conditions of one of the\nsubparas. of para.753(a) and was therefore, under the authority of R. v.\nMoore, a dangerous offender. In some cases that clarity will be present. In\nothers it may not. In those cases where it is not present a new hearing would\nbe required, as contemplated by s-s. 759(4)(a), in relation to the very first\nstage of the sentencing process, namely, deciding whether the offender is a\ndangerous offender.[81]The sentencing judge’s error in this case is\nsimply that he interpreted s. 753(1)(a) to require a high degree of\nfactual similarity between the circumstances of the offences, while ignoring the\nparallels in the unrestrained behaviour constituting those offences. Had he\nlooked at this case based on the similarities in Mr. Knife’s violent offending\nrather than the dissimilarities in the circumstances of that offending, the\nevidence was sufficient to establish that Mr. Knife should be designated as a\ndangerous offender under s. 753(1)(a)(i).[82]Mr. Knife has been committing violent offences\non a regular basis since he was 12 years old. It is appropriate to consider his\nyouth record in these circumstances because all of this past behaviour may be\npredictive of future behaviour. The levels of violence he used have increased\nfrom simple assaults to an assault with a weapon (the 2003 beer bottle\nassault), to manslaughter and aggravated assault (both involving extreme\nviolence with a knife). He has consistently failed to control this violence,\nand has been violent in a variety of different circumstances. Given this\nhistory, there is a pattern of repetitive behaviour which shows both a failure\nto restrain his behaviour and a likelihood of causing death or injury in the\nfuture.[83]As Dr. Lohrasbe indicated in his testimony, the\nfact Mr. Knife has committed violent offences in so many different contexts\npoints to the fact he is more likely to be violent in the future:… He has been violent when he has been\nintoxicated and he’s been sober. He has been violent in institutions. He has\nbeen violent outside of institutions, and we all know to the fact that he has\nbeen violent, at least to some degree, within a spousal relationship. So what we\nknow from that is that the -- his potential for violence is not restricted to a\nvery narrow situation. Just to illustrate that, there are some people who are\nrecurrently violent, but only in the context of ballroom [sic] brawls.\nThey seem to channel all their aggression in a very limited way, and if you can\nkeep them away from bars and keep them away from alcohol then you’ve got a leg\nup on -- on -- on limiting the context. What you’re pointing to is the breadth\nof the context within which he could be violent. (at T56)[84]There is also some factual similarity between\nall of Mr. Knife’s offences. As the Crown pointed out in its factum and in oral\nargument, Mr. Knife has acted in concert with others in virtually all of these\noffences. Dr. Lohrasbe picked up on this in his testimony, referring to Mr.\nKnife’s tendency to commit violent crimes in concert with others as a “somewhat\nunusual feature of his history” (T60), though Dr. Lohrasbe noted that he was\nunable to really explore why Mr. Knife tends to commit violent offences when he\nacts in concert with others.[85]There is even more factual similarity between\nMr. Knife’s two adult offences, perhaps not in their circumstantial contexts,\nbut in the elements of violence used. Mr. Knife violently stabbed two people in\nthe 2005 manslaughter. Mr. Knife violently stabbed two people in the 2008\npredicate offence. The similarity is not that he stabbed two people in each\ninstance —the number of victims is more coincidence than anything else—but\nrather that both of these offences involved a significant degree of violence\nusing a similar weapon and inflicting similar injuries on the victims. The only\nreason the charges were different was that Mr. Morin died while Mr. Dorion\nsurvived.[86]In summary, Mr. Knife has been committing\nviolent offences since he was a boy. Almost all of these offences have been\ncommitted in concert with others. These offences have escalated in the level of\nviolence used, culminating in the brutal stabbings of the 2005 manslaughter and\nthe 2008 predicate offence. Mr. Knife has been assessed at a high risk to\nreoffend violently in the future, though institutional programming and his\ndecision to leave the Indian Posse gang may help in lowering this risk. However,\nhis offending history demonstrates he repeatedly resorts to violence in a wide\nvariety of situations, and it is likely he will continue to offend in the\nfuture. In short, all of the elements of s. 753(1)(a)(i) are made out. Mr.\nKnife should be designated as a dangerous offender.[87]The Crown argues Mr. Knife can be designated as\na dangerous offender under either s. 753(1)(a)(i) or (ii). In light of my\nconclusion above, it is not necessary to consider whether Mr. Knife could also\nbe designated as a dangerous offender under s. 753(1)(a)(ii). Similarly, it is\nnot necessary for me to deal, as separate issues, with the Crown’s other two\narguments regarding the sentencing judge’s treatment of Mr. Knife’s youth\noffences and the expert evidence.F.Conclusion[88]The Crown’s sentence appeal is allowed. The\nsentencing judge erred by requiring too high a degree of factual similarity\nbetween the circumstances of Mr. Knife’s prior offences and the predicate offences,\nthereby losing sight of the repetitive elements of his violent behaviour and\nthe likelihood this violence will continue in the future. Mr. Knife’s behaviour\nindicates he is a danger to the public as contemplated by s. 753(1)(a)(i) and\nhe shall accordingly be designated as a dangerous offender. Pending the\nresolution of Mr. Knife’s cross-appeal on sentence below, his substantive\nsentence shall remain unaltered.V.Mr. knife’s cross-appeal[89]Mr. Knife cross-appealed his sentence, arguing the sentencing\njudge erred by designating him as a long-term offender; and erred in principle\nby imposing a sentence that was demonstrably unfit; and further erred in\ngranting him one to one remand credit. I will deal with each of these grounds\nof appeal in turn.A.Long-Term Offender Designation[90]In light of my conclusion above that the\nsentencing judge erred in declining to designate Mr. Knife a dangerous\noffender, this ground of appeal is moot.B.Fitness of the Sentence[91]Mr. Knife argues the sentencing judge erred in imposing\nan eight-year sentence. He submits the sentencing judge erred in principle in\ntwo respects: first, the sentencing judge failed to consider Mr. Knife’s\nprospects of rehabilitation and the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in R\nv Gladue, 1999 CanLII 679 (SCC), [1999] 1 SCR 688 [Gladue]; and second, the sentencing\njudge failed to apply the principle of parity because Messrs. Coutu and Raphael\nwere sentenced to shorter sentences than Mr. Knife.1.Rehabilitation[92]Mr. Knife argues the sentencing judge erred by\nfailing to consider Mr. Knife’s prospects for rehabilitation as mandated\nby Gladue. I cannot accept this submission.[93]The sentencing judge clearly referred to these\nprinciples at para. 92 of his decision, stating:It is the responsibility of this Court to\nimpose a fit and proper sentence, having regard to the sentencing principles\nand objectives set forth in the Criminal Code at ss. 718, 718.1 and\n718.2. Because the offender is aboriginal, I have considered, in particular, s.\n718.2(e) and decisions that have interpreted that subsection, including R.\nv. Gladue, 1999 CanLII 679 (SCC), [1999] 1 SCR 688, 171 DLR (4th) 385. The offence of aggravated\nassault is a serious offence as demonstrated by the fact that the maximum\npenalty is a term of imprisonment of up to 14 years.[94]Moreover, the sentencing judge’s reasons\ndisclose a preoccupation with Mr. Knife’s prospects for rehabilitation. The\nevidence before the sentencing judge was clear that Mr. Knife needed serious\nintervention in order to reduce his risk of reoffending in the future. Mr.\nKnife was placed in segregation shortly after the predicate offence was\ncommitted, and he was placed on remand in a provincial facility in June of\n2009. He remained on remand until the date of sentencing in May of 2013, and he\nthus did not have access to any rehabilitative programming during that time.[95]The sentencing judge recognized that Mr. Knife\nneeded institutional programming in order to rehabilitate himself, and he had\nnot yet had the opportunity to take such programming. He thus crafted a\nsentence which would ensure that Mr. Knife would be incarcerated for a\nsufficient period of time to allow him to complete the programming necessary for\nhis rehabilitation. He stated this at para. 103 of the sentencing judgment:Similarly, here the offender has spent\nalmost four years in pre-sentence custody. A two-for-one credit would have the\neffect of releasing the offender into the public immediately, which would have\npotentially disastrous consequences. He needs further incarceration, during\nwhich intensive programming for his problems should be undertaken.[96]The sentencing judge also recognized Mr. Knife\nneeds eventual assistance in the community in order to effectively facilitate\nhis rehabilitation and reintegration. This is why he decided to impose a\nlengthy long-term supervision order (or LTSO). This reasoning can be found at para.\n106 of the sentencing judgment:In my view, a lengthy long-term\nsupervision order is required in order to give the offender the best chance to\nsucceed and to protect the public. The longer that he can be supervised in the\ncommunity, the better. There is no rational basis in this case to reduce the\nlong-term supervision order from the ten-year maximum.[97]As an aside, I am not convinced it is correct in\nprinciple to begin from the presumption of a ten-year LTSO and to only reduce\nthe length if a lesser LTSO will give the offender a sufficient chance to\nsuccessfully reintegrate into the community while still adequately protecting\nthe public. In cases where it is appropriate to order an LTSO, the length of\nthe LTSO should be tailored to the specific needs of each offender, and the\nsentencing judge’s reasons should disclose why a particular length is being\nordered. However, based on the evidence before the sentencing judge I accept\nthat a ten-year LTSO was an appropriate order on the facts of this case.[98]The LTSO order and the reasons for it disclose the\nsentencing judge was clearly alive to the importance of the principle of\nrehabilitation. He crafted a sentence which, based on the evidence before him,\ngave Mr. Knife the best opportunity to be rehabilitated. I fail to see how this\nis an error in principle. This ground of appeal should be dismissed.2.Parity[99]Mr. Knife argues the sentencing judge erred in\nprinciple by failing to take into account the sentences received by his two\nco-accused. Mr. Knife did not disclose to this Court in his factum or in oral\nargument what those sentences were or why the co-accused received lighter\nsentences than Mr. Knife. However, a close examination of the transcript\nof Mr. Knife’s dangerous offender hearing and the lower court file reveals the\nfollowing.[100]First, Mr. Coutu was sentenced pursuant to a\njoint submission after entering a guilty plea. He received a sentence of 48\nmonths. However, he was serving a life sentence at the time of this offence, so\nthe sentence that he received for this offence was imposed in an unusual\ncontext.[101]Second, Mr. Raphael initially entered a not\nguilty plea. After the preliminary inquiry, he changed his plea to guilty. He\nwas sentenced to 44 months pursuant to a joint submission. There is no\nother indication in the file as to why he received such a comparatively short\nsentence.[102]The principle of parity requires that sentences\nwhich are given to co-accused for the same crime be similar unless there is a\njustified reason for disparity: R v O’Soup, 2011 SKCA 97 (CanLII) at paras 9-10,\n385 Sask R 2. However, as this Court noted in R v Akapew, 2009 SKCA 137 (CanLII)\nat para 20, 249 CCC (3d) 212, the sentence imposed on a co-accused is\npersuasive for the purpose of the parity principle, but if the sentence imposed\non the co-accused is inadequate, it should be ignored.[103]The sentencing judge in this case correctly\nnoted that the range for similar aggravated assaults involving a similar level\nof violence with similar aggravating factors is seven to eight-and-a-half\nyears. See, e.g.: R v Keepness, 2010 SKCA 69 (CanLII), 255 CCC (3d) 457 (seven\nyears); R v Fulton, 2012 ONCA 781 (CanLII), 105 WCB (2d) 612 (nine years); R v\nLarose, 2013 BCCA 450 (CanLII), 344 BCAC 159 (seven years); R v Agyeman, 2012 ONCA 893 (CanLII), 2012\nONCA 893 (eight years).[104]The sentences Mr. Coutu and Mr. Raphael received\nwere well below this range. While we have no information on why these offenders\nreceived such low sentences, they do not automatically entitle Mr. Knife to a\nsentence which is also below the acceptable range. The sentence imposed on\nMr. Knife is a fit sentence, and the sentences imposed on his co-accused\nwould be inadequate for Mr. Knife, given his own circumstances and the\nparamount principle of public protection in the context of a sentence under\nPart XXIV. The sentences received by Messrs. Coutu and Raphael do not govern\nhere, and this ground of appeal must be dismissed.3.Remand Credit[105]Mr. Knife’s final ground of appeal is the issue\nof remand credit. He spent approximately four years on remand. The sentencing\njudge declined to grant him enhanced credit, as to do so would mean he would be\nreleased into the community almost immediately. Given his violent behaviour and\nthe need for significant institutional programming, releasing him almost\nimmediately would, in the words of the sentencing judge, “have potentially\ndisastrous consequences” (at para. 103). The sentencing judge declined to grant\nenhanced credit, and instead used his discretion to grant one to one credit so Mr. Knife\ncan spend adequate time in custody for him to complete the necessary\nprogramming.[106]I begin by noting the predicate offence was\ncommitted before the 2010 amendments to s. 719 of the Criminal Code came\ninto effect, but Mr. Knife was sentenced after those amendments came into\neffect. It is the old version of this section that applies to the issue of\nremand credit for Mr. Knife: R v Marriott, 2014 NSCA 28 (CanLII) at paras 88-89,\n309 CCC (3d) 305.[107]The granting of remand credit above the\nstatutory minimum is a discretionary decision, and it attracts a deferential\nstandard of review. In R v E.E.D., 2007 SKCA 99 (CanLII), 304 Sask R 192, this\nCourt dismissed an offender’s appeal on an identical remand credit issue. It stated:[74] Even though it is common to give\ndouble credit in sentencing for time spent on remand, there clearly is no\nabsolute rule to this effect. The discretion accorded to the trial judge is\nparticularly important in a context like the one before us, in which the trial\njudge must consider what period of incarceration is required, where certain\nprogramming will be available, so that, coupled with a period of community\nsupervision, the risk to the community posed by a long-term offender can be\ncontrolled.[75] In my view, there is no basis to\ninterfere with the discretion of the trial judge in relation to this ground of\nappeal.[108]This reasoning applies equally to the case\nbefore us. The sentencing judge clearly considered defence counsel’s request\nfor enhanced credit, but held it would not appropriately provide Mr. Knife with\nthe programming he required so that his risk could be reduced and reasonably\ncontrolled in the community. The sentencing judge was not obligated to grant\nenhanced credit and he had a justified, principled reason for declining to\ngrant such credit in this case: namely, Mr. Knife’s rehabilitative needs. There\nis no basis for this Court to interfere with his discretion on this ground.\nThis ground of appeal must be dismissed.VI.Conclusion[109]The Crown’s sentence appeal is allowed, and Mr. Knife shall be\ndesignated as a dangerous offender. The sentencing judge erred in law by\nrequiring too high a degree of factual similarity between Mr. Knife’s prior\noffences, thereby misapplying s. 753(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. Mr.\nKnife’s cross-appeal on sentence is dismissed, as the sentencing judge did not\nerr in principle and imposed a determinate sentence that was fit in the\ncircumstances. The end result is that Mr. Knife’s designation shall change from\na long-term offender to a dangerous offender, but his substantive sentence\nshall remain unaltered.Dated at the City of Regina, in the Province of\nSaskatchewan, this 8th day of July, A.D. 2015.“Lane\nJ.A.”Lane\nJ.A.I\nconcur.“Richards C.J.S.”Richards\nC.J.S.I\nconcur.“Herauf J.A.”Herauf\nJ.A."}
